          Hey! 🤗 Thanks for your contribution to the `transformers` library!
          Before merging this pull request, slow tests CI should be triggered. To enable this:
          - Add the `run-slow` label to the PR
          - When your PR is ready for merge and all reviewers' comments have been addressed, push an empty commit with the command `[run-slow]` followed by a comma separated list of all the models to be tested, i.e. `[run_slow] model_to_test_1, model_to_test_2`
          - A `transformers` maintainer will then approve the workflow to start the tests
          
          (For maintainers) The documentation for slow tests CI on PRs is [here](https://www.notion.so/huggingface2/CI-for-pull-requests-8335bd9217d24d1e8ed1d3a016f39804).

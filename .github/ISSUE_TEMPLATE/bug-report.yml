        Your issue will be replied to more quickly if you can figure out the right person to tag with @
        If you know how to use git blame, that is the easiest way, otherwise, here is a rough guide of **who to tag**.

        All issues are read by one of the core maintainers, so if you don't know who to tag, just leave this blank and
        a core maintainer will ping the right person.

        Please tag fewer than 3 people.

        Models:

          - text models: @ArthurZucker
          - vision models: @amyeroberts, @qubvel
          - speech models: @eustlb
          - graph models: @clefourrier

        Library:

          - flax: @gante and @Rocketknight1
          - generate: @zucchini-nlp (visual-language models) or @gante (all others)
          - pipelines: @Rocketknight1
          - tensorflow: @gante and @Rocketknight1
          - tokenizers: @ArthurZucker and @itazap

        Model hub:

          - for issues with a model, report at https://discuss.huggingface.co/ and tag the model's creator.

        HF projects:

          - accelerate: [different repo](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate)
          - datasets: [different repo](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets)
          - diffusers: [different repo](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)

        Maintained examples (not research project or legacy):

          - Flax: @Rocketknight1
          - PyTorch: See Models above and tag the person corresponding to the modality of the example.
          - TensorFlow: @Rocketknight1

        Research projects are not maintained and should be taken as is.

        Please provide a code sample that reproduces the problem you ran into. It can be a Colab link or just a code snippet.
        Please include relevant config information with your code, for example your Trainers, TRL, Peft, and DeepSpeed configs.
        If you have code snippets, error messages, stack traces please provide them here as well.
        Important! Use code tags to correctly format your code. See https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#syntax-highlighting
        Do not use screenshots, as they are hard to read and (more importantly) don't allow others to copy-and-paste your code.

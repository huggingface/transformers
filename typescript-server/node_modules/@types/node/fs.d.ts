     * 1. No case conversion is performed on case-insensitive file systems.

     * (much) higher than what the native [`realpath(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realpath.3.html) implementation supports.
     *
     * The `callback` gets two arguments `(err, resolvedPath)`. May use `process.cwd` to resolve relative paths.
     *
     * Only paths that can be converted to UTF8 strings are supported.
     *
     * The optional `options` argument can be a string specifying an encoding, or an
     * object with an `encoding` property specifying the character encoding to use for
     * the path passed to the callback. If the `encoding` is set to `'buffer'`,
     * the path returned will be passed as a `Buffer` object.
     *
     * If `path` resolves to a socket or a pipe, the function will return a system
     * dependent name for that object.

     * The `encoding` option is ignored if `data` is a buffer.

     * It is unsafe to use `fs.writeFile()` multiple times on the same file without
     * waiting for the callback. For this scenario, {@link createWriteStream} is
     * recommended.
     *
     * Similarly to `fs.readFile` \- `fs.writeFile` is a convenience method that
     * performs multiple `write` calls internally to write the buffer passed to it.
     * For performance sensitive code consider using {@link createWriteStream}.
     *
     * It is possible to use an `AbortSignal` to cancel an `fs.writeFile()`.
     * Cancelation is "best effort", and some amount of data is likely still
     * to be written.

     * ```js
     * import { writeFile } from 'node:fs';
     * import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

     * const { signal } = controller;

     *   // When a request is aborted - the callback is called with an AbortError
     * });
     * // When the request should be aborted
     * controller.abort();
     * ```
     *
     * Aborting an ongoing request does not abort individual operating
     * system requests but rather the internal buffering `fs.writeFile` performs.

     *   // This does not cancel pending read operations, and if there is such an
     *   // operation, the process may still not be able to exit successfully

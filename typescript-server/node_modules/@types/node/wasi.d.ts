/**
 * **The `node:wasi` module does not currently provide the**
 * **comprehensive file system security properties provided by some WASI runtimes.**
 * **Full support for secure file system sandboxing may or may not be implemented in**
 * **future. In the mean time, do not rely on it to run untrusted code.**
 *
 * The WASI API provides an implementation of the [WebAssembly System Interface](https://wasi.dev/) specification. WASI gives WebAssembly applications access to the underlying
 * operating system via a collection of POSIX-like functions.
 *
 * ```js
 * import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
 * import { WASI } from 'node:wasi';
 * import { argv, env } from 'node:process';
 *
 * const wasi = new WASI({
 *   version: 'preview1',
 *   args: argv,
 *   env,
 *   preopens: {
 *     '/local': '/some/real/path/that/wasm/can/access',
 *   },
 * });
 *
 * const wasm = await WebAssembly.compile(
 *   await readFile(new URL('./demo.wasm', import.meta.url)),
 * );
 * const instance = await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasm, wasi.getImportObject());
 *
 * wasi.start(instance);
 * ```
 *
 * To run the above example, create a new WebAssembly text format file named `demo.wat`:
 *
 * ```text
 * (module
 *     ;; Import the required fd_write WASI function which will write the given io vectors to stdout
 *     ;; The function signature for fd_write is:
 *     ;; (File Descriptor, *iovs, iovs_len, nwritten) -> Returns number of bytes written
 *     (import "wasi_snapshot_preview1" "fd_write" (func $fd_write (param i32 i32 i32 i32) (result i32)))
 *
 *     (memory 1)
 *     (export "memory" (memory 0))
 *
 *     ;; Write 'hello world\n' to memory at an offset of 8 bytes
 *     ;; Note the trailing newline which is required for the text to appear
 *     (data (i32.const 8) "hello world\n")
 *
 *     (func $main (export "_start")
 *         ;; Creating a new io vector within linear memory
 *         (i32.store (i32.const 0) (i32.const 8))  ;; iov.iov_base - This is a pointer to the start of the 'hello world\n' string
 *         (i32.store (i32.const 4) (i32.const 12))  ;; iov.iov_len - The length of the 'hello world\n' string
 *
 *         (call $fd_write
 *             (i32.const 1) ;; file_descriptor - 1 for stdout
 *             (i32.const 0) ;; *iovs - The pointer to the iov array, which is stored at memory location 0
 *             (i32.const 1) ;; iovs_len - We're printing 1 string stored in an iov - so one.
 *             (i32.const 20) ;; nwritten - A place in memory to store the number of bytes written
 *         )
 *         drop ;; Discard the number of bytes written from the top of the stack
 *     )
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * Use [wabt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) to compile `.wat` to `.wasm`
 *
 * ```bash
 * wat2wasm demo.wat
 * ```
 * @experimental
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v24.x/lib/wasi.js)

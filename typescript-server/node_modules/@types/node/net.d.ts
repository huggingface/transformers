         *

         * * `server.listen(options[, callback])`

         * This function is asynchronous. When the server starts listening, the `'listening'` event will be emitted. The last parameter `callback`will be added as a listener for the `'listening'`
         * event.
         *
         * All `listen()` methods can take a `backlog` parameter to specify the maximum
         * length of the queue of pending connections. The actual length will be determined
         * by the OS through sysctl settings such as `tcp_max_syn_backlog` and `somaxconn` on Linux. The default value of this parameter is 511 (not 512).

         * details).

         * error during the first `server.listen()` call or `server.close()` has been
         * called. Otherwise, an `ERR_SERVER_ALREADY_LISTEN` error will be thrown.

     * Creates a new TCP or `IPC` server.
     *
     * If `allowHalfOpen` is set to `true`, when the other end of the socket
     * signals the end of transmission, the server will only send back the end of
     * transmission when `socket.end()` is explicitly called. For example, in the
     * context of TCP, when a FIN packed is received, a FIN packed is sent
     * back only when `socket.end()` is explicitly called. Until then the
     * connection is half-closed (non-readable but still writable). See `'end'` event and [RFC 1122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122) (section 4.2.2.13) for more information.
     *
     * If `pauseOnConnect` is set to `true`, then the socket associated with each
     * incoming connection will be paused, and no data will be read from its handle.
     * This allows connections to be passed between processes without any data being
     * read by the original process. To begin reading data from a paused socket, call `socket.resume()`.
     *
     * The server can be a TCP server or an `IPC` server, depending on what it `listen()` to.
     *
     * Here is an example of a TCP echo server which listens for connections
     * on port 8124:
     *
     * ```js
     * import net from 'node:net';
     * const server = net.createServer((c) => {
     *   // 'connection' listener.
     *   console.log('client connected');
     *   c.on('end', () => {
     *     console.log('client disconnected');
     *   });
     *   c.write('hello\r\n');
     *   c.pipe(c);
     * });
     * server.on('error', (err) => {
     *   throw err;
     * });
     * server.listen(8124, () => {
     *   console.log('server bound');
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Test this by using `telnet`:
     *
     * ```bash
     * telnet localhost 8124
     * ```
     *
     * To listen on the socket `/tmp/echo.sock`:
     *
     * ```js
     * server.listen('/tmp/echo.sock', () => {
     *   console.log('server bound');
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Use `nc` to connect to a Unix domain socket server:
     *
     * ```bash
     * nc -U /tmp/echo.sock
     * ```

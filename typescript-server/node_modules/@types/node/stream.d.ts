/**
 * A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js.
 * The `node:stream` module provides an API for implementing the stream interface.
 *
 * There are many stream objects provided by Node.js. For instance, a [request to an HTTP server](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage)
 * and [`process.stdout`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/process.html#processstdout) are both stream instances.
 *
 * Streams can be readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/events.html#class-eventemitter).
 *
 * To access the `node:stream` module:
 *
 * ```js
 * import stream from 'node:stream';
 * ```
 *
 * The `node:stream` module is useful for creating new types of stream instances.
 * It is usually not necessary to use the `node:stream` module to consume streams.
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v24.x/lib/stream.js)

         * Especially useful in error handling scenarios where a stream is destroyed
         * prematurely (like an aborted HTTP request), and will not emit `'end'` or `'finish'`.
         *
         * The `finished` API provides [`promise version`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/stream.html#streamfinishedstream-options).

         * `stream.finished()` leaves dangling event listeners (in particular `'error'`, `'end'`, `'finish'` and `'close'`) after `callback` has been
         * invoked. The reason for this is so that unexpected `'error'` events (due to
         * incorrect stream implementations) do not cause unexpected crashes.
         * If this is unwanted behavior then the returned cleanup function needs to be
         * invoked in the callback:
         *
         * ```js
         * const cleanup = finished(rs, (err) => {
         *   cleanup();
         *   // ...
         * });
         * ```
         * @since v10.0.0
         * @param stream A readable and/or writable stream.
         * @param callback A callback function that takes an optional error argument.
         * @returns A cleanup function which removes all registered listeners.

         *
         * `stream.pipeline()` will call `stream.destroy(err)` on all streams except:

         * The `IncomingRequest` usage with `pipeline` could lead to an unexpected behavior

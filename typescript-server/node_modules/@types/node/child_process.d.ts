/**
 * The `node:child_process` module provides the ability to spawn subprocesses in
 * a manner that is similar, but not identical, to [`popen(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/popen.3.html). This capability
 * is primarily provided by the {@link spawn} function:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { spawn } from 'node:child_process';
 * const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
 *
 * ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
 *   console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
 * });
 *
 * ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
 *   console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
 * });
 *
 * ls.on('close', (code) => {
 *   console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * By default, pipes for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are established between
 * the parent Node.js process and the spawned subprocess. These pipes have
 * limited (and platform-specific) capacity. If the subprocess writes to
 * stdout in excess of that limit without the output being captured, the
 * subprocess blocks waiting for the pipe buffer to accept more data. This is
 * identical to the behavior of pipes in the shell. Use the `{ stdio: 'ignore' }` option if the output will not be consumed.
 *
 * The command lookup is performed using the `options.env.PATH` environment
 * variable if `env` is in the `options` object. Otherwise, `process.env.PATH` is
 * used. If `options.env` is set without `PATH`, lookup on Unix is performed
 * on a default search path search of `/usr/bin:/bin` (see your operating system's
 * manual for execvpe/execvp), on Windows the current processes environment
 * variable `PATH` is used.
 *
 * On Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive. Node.js
 * lexicographically sorts the `env` keys and uses the first one that
 * case-insensitively matches. Only first (in lexicographic order) entry will be
 * passed to the subprocess. This might lead to issues on Windows when passing
 * objects to the `env` option that have multiple variants of the same key, such as `PATH` and `Path`.
 *
 * The {@link spawn} method spawns the child process asynchronously,
 * without blocking the Node.js event loop. The {@link spawnSync} function provides equivalent functionality in a synchronous manner that blocks
 * the event loop until the spawned process either exits or is terminated.
 *
 * For convenience, the `node:child_process` module provides a handful of
 * synchronous and asynchronous alternatives to {@link spawn} and {@link spawnSync}. Each of these alternatives are implemented on
 * top of {@link spawn} or {@link spawnSync}.
 *
 * * {@link exec}: spawns a shell and runs a command within that
 * shell, passing the `stdout` and `stderr` to a callback function when
 * complete.
 * * {@link execFile}: similar to {@link exec} except
 * that it spawns the command directly without first spawning a shell by
 * default.
 * * {@link fork}: spawns a new Node.js process and invokes a
 * specified module with an IPC communication channel established that allows
 * sending messages between parent and child.
 * * {@link execSync}: a synchronous version of {@link exec} that will block the Node.js event loop.
 * * {@link execFileSync}: a synchronous version of {@link execFile} that will block the Node.js event loop.
 *
 * For certain use cases, such as automating shell scripts, the `synchronous counterparts` may be more convenient. In many cases, however,
 * the synchronous methods can have significant impact on performance due to
 * stalling the event loop while spawned processes complete.

         * be used to send messages to the child process. When the child process is a
         * Node.js instance, these messages can be received via the `'message'` event.
         *
         * The message goes through serialization and parsing. The resulting
         * message might not be the same as what is originally sent.
         *
         * For example, in the parent script:
         *

         * // Causes the child to print: CHILD got message: { hello: 'world' }
         * n.send({ hello: 'world' });
         * ```
         *
         * And then the child script, `'sub.js'` might look like this:
         *
         * ```js
         * process.on('message', (m) => {
         *   console.log('CHILD got message:', m);
         * });
         *
         * // Causes the parent to print: PARENT got message: { foo: 'bar', baz: null }
         * process.send({ foo: 'bar', baz: NaN });
         * ```
         *
         * Child Node.js processes will have a `process.send()` method of their own
         * that allows the child to send messages back to the parent.
         *
         * There is a special case when sending a `{cmd: 'NODE_foo'}` message. Messages
         * containing a `NODE_` prefix in the `cmd` property are reserved for use within
         * Node.js core and will not be emitted in the child's `'message'` event. Rather, such messages are emitted using the `'internalMessage'` event and are consumed internally by Node.js.
         * Applications should avoid using such messages or listening for `'internalMessage'` events as it is subject to change without notice.
         *
         * The optional `sendHandle` argument that may be passed to `subprocess.send()` is
         * for passing a TCP server or socket object to the child process. The child will
         * receive the object as the second argument passed to the callback function
         * registered on the `'message'` event. Any data that is received and buffered in
         * the socket will not be sent to the child. Sending IPC sockets is not supported on Windows.
         *
         * The optional `callback` is a function that is invoked after the message is
         * sent but before the child may have received it. The function is called with a
         * single argument: `null` on success, or an `Error` object on failure.
         *
         * If no `callback` function is provided and the message cannot be sent, an `'error'` event will be emitted by the `ChildProcess` object. This can
         * happen, for instance, when the child process has already exited.
         *
         * `subprocess.send()` will return `false` if the channel has closed or when the
         * backlog of unsent messages exceeds a threshold that makes it unwise to send
         * more. Otherwise, the method returns `true`. The `callback` function can be
         * used to implement flow control.
         *
         * #### Example: sending a server object
         *
         * The `sendHandle` argument can be used, for instance, to pass the handle of
         * a TCP server object to the child process as illustrated in the example below:
         *
         * ```js
         * import { createServer } from 'node:net';
         * import { fork } from 'node:child_process';
         * const subprocess = fork('subprocess.js');
         *
         * // Open up the server object and send the handle.
         * const server = createServer();
         * server.on('connection', (socket) => {
         *   socket.end('handled by parent');
         * });
         * server.listen(1337, () => {
         *   subprocess.send('server', server);
         * });
         * ```
         *
         * The child would then receive the server object as:
         *
         * ```js
         * process.on('message', (m, server) => {
         *   if (m === 'server') {
         *     server.on('connection', (socket) => {
         *       socket.end('handled by child');
         *     });
         *   }
         * });
         * ```
         *
         * Once the server is now shared between the parent and child, some connections
         * can be handled by the parent and some by the child.
         *
         * While the example above uses a server created using the `node:net` module, `node:dgram` module servers use exactly the same workflow with the exceptions of
         * listening on a `'message'` event instead of `'connection'` and using `server.bind()` instead of `server.listen()`. This is, however, only
         * supported on Unix platforms.
         *
         * #### Example: sending a socket object
         *
         * Similarly, the `sendHandler` argument can be used to pass the handle of a
         * socket to the child process. The example below spawns two children that each
         * handle connections with "normal" or "special" priority:
         *
         * ```js
         * import { createServer } from 'node:net';
         * import { fork } from 'node:child_process';
         * const normal = fork('subprocess.js', ['normal']);
         * const special = fork('subprocess.js', ['special']);
         *
         * // Open up the server and send sockets to child. Use pauseOnConnect to prevent
         * // the sockets from being read before they are sent to the child process.
         * const server = createServer({ pauseOnConnect: true });
         * server.on('connection', (socket) => {
         *
         *   // If this is special priority...
         *   if (socket.remoteAddress === '74.125.127.100') {
         *     special.send('socket', socket);
         *     return;
         *   }
         *   // This is normal priority.
         *   normal.send('socket', socket);
         * });
         * server.listen(1337);
         * ```
         *

     * ```
     *
     * Use `cwd` to specify the working directory from which the process is spawned.
     * If not given, the default is to inherit the current working directory. If given,
     * but the path does not exist, the child process emits an `ENOENT` error
     * and exits immediately. `ENOENT` is also emitted when the command
     * does not exist.
     *
     * Use `env` to specify environment variables that will be visible to the new
     * process, the default is `process.env`.
     *
     * `undefined` values in `env` will be ignored.
     *
     * Example of running `ls -lh /usr`, capturing `stdout`, `stderr`, and the
     * exit code:
     *
     * ```js
     * import { spawn } from 'node:child_process';
     * const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
     *
     * ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {

     * ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
     *   console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
     * });
     *
     * ls.on('close', (code) => {
     *   console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Example: A very elaborate way to run `ps ax | grep ssh`
     *
     * ```js
     * import { spawn } from 'node:child_process';
     * const ps = spawn('ps', ['ax']);
     * const grep = spawn('grep', ['ssh']);
     *
     * ps.stdout.on('data', (data) => {

     * });
     *
     * ps.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
     *   console.error(`ps stderr: ${data}`);

     *
     * ps.on('close', (code) => {

     * grep.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
     *   console.log(data.toString());
     * });
     *
     * grep.stderr.on('data', (data) => {

     *   if (code !== 0) {
     *     console.log(`grep process exited with code ${code}`);
     *   }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Example of checking for failed `spawn`:
     *
     * ```js
     * import { spawn } from 'node:child_process';
     * const subprocess = spawn('bad_command');
     *
     * subprocess.on('error', (err) => {
     *   console.error('Failed to start subprocess.');
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Certain platforms (macOS, Linux) will use the value of `argv[0]` for the process
     * title while others (Windows, SunOS) will use `command`.
     *
     * Node.js overwrites `argv[0]` with `process.execPath` on startup, so `process.argv[0]` in a Node.js child process will not match the `argv0` parameter passed to `spawn` from the parent. Retrieve
     * it with the `process.argv0` property instead.
     *
     * If the `signal` option is enabled, calling `.abort()` on the corresponding `AbortController` is similar to calling `.kill()` on the child process except
     * the error passed to the callback will be an `AbortError`:
     *
     * ```js
     * import { spawn } from 'node:child_process';
     * const controller = new AbortController();
     * const { signal } = controller;
     * const grep = spawn('grep', ['ssh'], { signal });
     * grep.on('error', (err) => {
     *   // This will be called with err being an AbortError if the controller aborts
     * });
     * controller.abort(); // Stops the child process
     * ```
     * @since v0.1.90
     * @param command The command to run.
     * @param args List of string arguments.

     * Spawns a shell then executes the `command` within that shell, buffering any
     * generated output. The `command` string passed to the exec function is processed
     * directly by the shell and special characters (vary based on [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_command-line_interpreters))
     * need to be dealt with accordingly:
     *
     * ```js
     * import { exec } from 'node:child_process';
     *
     * exec('"/path/to/test file/test.sh" arg1 arg2');
     * // Double quotes are used so that the space in the path is not interpreted as
     * // a delimiter of multiple arguments.
     *
     * exec('echo "The \\$HOME variable is $HOME"');
     * // The $HOME variable is escaped in the first instance, but not in the second.
     * ```
     *
     * **Never pass unsanitized user input to this function. Any input containing shell**
     * **metacharacters may be used to trigger arbitrary command execution.**
     *
     * If a `callback` function is provided, it is called with the arguments `(error, stdout, stderr)`. On success, `error` will be `null`. On error, `error` will be an instance of `Error`. The
     * `error.code` property will be
     * the exit code of the process. By convention, any exit code other than `0` indicates an error. `error.signal` will be the signal that terminated the
     * process.
     *
     * The `stdout` and `stderr` arguments passed to the callback will contain the
     * stdout and stderr output of the child process. By default, Node.js will decode
     * the output as UTF-8 and pass strings to the callback. The `encoding` option
     * can be used to specify the character encoding used to decode the stdout and
     * stderr output. If `encoding` is `'buffer'`, or an unrecognized character
     * encoding, `Buffer` objects will be passed to the callback instead.
     *
     * ```js
     * import { exec } from 'node:child_process';
     * exec('cat *.js missing_file | wc -l', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
     *   if (error) {
     *     console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
     *     return;
     *   }
     *   console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
     *   console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * If `timeout` is greater than `0`, the parent will send the signal
     * identified by the `killSignal` property (the default is `'SIGTERM'`) if the
     * child runs longer than `timeout` milliseconds.
     *
     * Unlike the [`exec(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html) POSIX system call, `child_process.exec()` does not replace
     * the existing process and uses a shell to execute the command.
     *
     * If this method is invoked as its `util.promisify()` ed version, it returns
     * a `Promise` for an `Object` with `stdout` and `stderr` properties. The returned `ChildProcess` instance is attached to the `Promise` as a `child` property. In
     * case of an error (including any error resulting in an exit code other than 0), a
     * rejected promise is returned, with the same `error` object given in the
     * callback, but with two additional properties `stdout` and `stderr`.
     *
     * ```js
     * import util from 'node:util';
     * import child_process from 'node:child_process';
     * const exec = util.promisify(child_process.exec);
     *
     * async function lsExample() {
     *   const { stdout, stderr } = await exec('ls');
     *   console.log('stdout:', stdout);
     *   console.error('stderr:', stderr);
     * }
     * lsExample();
     * ```
     *
     * If the `signal` option is enabled, calling `.abort()` on the corresponding `AbortController` is similar to calling `.kill()` on the child process except
     * the error passed to the callback will be an `AbortError`:
     *
     * ```js
     * import { exec } from 'node:child_process';
     * const controller = new AbortController();
     * const { signal } = controller;
     * const child = exec('grep ssh', { signal }, (error) => {
     *   console.error(error); // an AbortError
     * });
     * controller.abort();
     * ```
     * @since v0.1.90
     * @param command The command to run, with space-separated arguments.
     * @param callback called with the output when process terminates.

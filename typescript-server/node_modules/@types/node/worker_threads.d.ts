/**
 * The `node:worker_threads` module enables the use of threads that execute
 * JavaScript in parallel. To access it:
 *
 * ```js
 * import worker from 'node:worker_threads';
 * ```
 *
 * Workers (threads) are useful for performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations.
 * They do not help much with I/O-intensive work. The Node.js built-in
 * asynchronous I/O operations are more efficient than Workers can be.
 *
 * Unlike `child_process` or `cluster`, `worker_threads` can share memory. They do
 * so by transferring `ArrayBuffer` instances or sharing `SharedArrayBuffer` instances.
 *
 * ```js
 * import {
 *   Worker,
 *   isMainThread,
 *   parentPort,
 *   workerData,
 * } from 'node:worker_threads';
 *
 * if (!isMainThread) {
 *   const { parse } = await import('some-js-parsing-library');
 *   const script = workerData;
 *   parentPort.postMessage(parse(script));
 * }
 *
 * export default function parseJSAsync(script) {
 *   return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
 *     const worker = new Worker(new URL(import.meta.url), {
 *       workerData: script,
 *     });
 *     worker.on('message', resolve);
 *     worker.on('error', reject);
 *     worker.on('exit', (code) => {
 *       if (code !== 0)
 *         reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`));
 *     });
 *   });
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * The above example spawns a Worker thread for each `parseJSAsync()` call. In
 * practice, use a pool of Workers for these kinds of tasks. Otherwise, the
 * overhead of creating Workers would likely exceed their benefit.
 *
 * When implementing a worker pool, use the `AsyncResource` API to inform
 * diagnostic tools (e.g. to provide asynchronous stack traces) about the
 * correlation between tasks and their outcomes. See `"Using AsyncResource for a Worker thread pool"` in the `async_hooks` documentation for an example implementation.
 *
 * Worker threads inherit non-process-specific options by default. Refer to `Worker constructor options` to know how to customize worker thread options,
 * specifically `argv` and `execArgv` options.
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v24.x/lib/worker_threads.js)

     * * `process.exit()` does not stop the whole program, just the single thread,
     * and `process.abort()` is not available.
     * * `process.chdir()` and `process` methods that set group or user ids
     * are not available.
     * * `process.env` is a copy of the parent thread's environment variables,
     * unless otherwise specified. Changes to one copy are not visible in other
     * threads, and are not visible to native add-ons (unless `worker.SHARE_ENV` is passed as the `env` option to the `Worker` constructor). On Windows, unlike the main thread, a copy of the
     * environment variables operates in a case-sensitive manner.
     * * `process.title` cannot be modified.
     * * Signals are not delivered through `process.on('...')`.
     * * Execution may stop at any point as a result of `worker.terminate()` being invoked.
     * * IPC channels from parent processes are not accessible.
     * * The `trace_events` module is not supported.
     * * Native add-ons can only be loaded from multiple threads if they fulfill `certain conditions`.
     *
     * Creating `Worker` instances inside of other `Worker`s is possible.
     *
     * Like [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) and the `node:cluster module`, two-way communication
     * can be achieved through inter-thread message passing. Internally, a `Worker` has
     * a built-in pair of `MessagePort` s that are already associated with each
     * other when the `Worker` is created. While the `MessagePort` object on the parent
     * side is not directly exposed, its functionalities are exposed through `worker.postMessage()` and the `worker.on('message')` event
     * on the `Worker` object for the parent thread.
     *
     * To create custom messaging channels (which is encouraged over using the default
     * global channel because it facilitates separation of concerns), users can create
     * a `MessageChannel` object on either thread and pass one of the`MessagePort`s on that `MessageChannel` to the other thread through a
     * pre-existing channel, such as the global one.

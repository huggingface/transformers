# Fix SmolVLM2 quantization dtype mismatch

## What does this PR do?

Fixes #41453 - SmolVLM2 cannot be used with quantization due to dtype mismatch error.

**Problem**: When loading SmolVLM2 with BitsAndBytesConfig and bfloat16, the `inputs_merger` function fails with:
```
RuntimeError: Index put requires the source and destination dtypes match, got BFloat16 for the destination and Float for the source.
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Quantization forces `inputs_embeds` to `torch.bfloat16` (from BitsAndBytesConfig)
- Vision encoder outputs `image_hidden_states` in `torch.float32` 
- Direct assignment between incompatible dtypes causes the crash

**Solution**: Added dtype conversion to ensure `image_hidden_states` matches `inputs_embeds` dtype before assignment:

```python
# Before (BROKEN):
image_embeds[image_mask] = image_hidden_states[block_idx[image_mask], local_idx[image_mask], :]

# After (FIXED):
# Ensure dtype compatibility for quantization
image_hidden_states = image_hidden_states.to(dtype=inputs_embeds.dtype)
image_embeds[image_mask] = image_hidden_states[block_idx[image_mask], local_idx[image_mask], :]
```

**Changes**:
- Modified `src/transformers/models/smolvlm/modeling_smolvlm.py` - Added dtype conversion in `inputs_merger` function
- Updated `src/transformers/models/smolvlm/modular_smolvlm.py` - Aligned modular file with same fix
- Added test in `tests/models/smolvlm/test_modeling_smolvlm.py` - `test_quantization_dtype_compatibility()` with `@slow` decorator

**Testing**: The fix has been thoroughly tested and verified to resolve the quantization dtype mismatch issue without breaking existing functionality.

Fixes #41453

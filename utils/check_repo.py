"""
Utility that performs several consistency checks on the repo. This includes:
- checking all models are properly defined in the __init__ of models/
- checking all models are in the main __init__
- checking all models are properly tested
- checking all object in the main __init__ are documented
- checking all models are in at least one auto class
- checking all the auto mapping are properly defined (no typos, importable)
- checking the list of deprecated models is up to date

Use from the root of the repo with (as used in `make repo-consistency`):

```bash
python utils/check_repo.py
```

It has no auto-fix mode.

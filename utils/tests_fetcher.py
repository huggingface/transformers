Welcome to tests_fetcher V2.

This util is designed to fetch tests to run on a PR so that only the tests impacted by the modifications are run, and
when too many models are being impacted, only run the tests of a subset of core models. It works like this.

Stage 1: Identify the modified files. For jobs that run on the main branch, it's just the diff with the last commit.
On a PR, this takes all the files from the branching point to the current commit (so all modifications in a PR, not
just the last commit) but excludes modifications that are on docstrings or comments only.

Stage 2: Extract the tests to run. This is done by looking at the imports in each module and test file: if module A
imports module B, then changing module B impacts module A, so the tests using module A should be run. We thus get the
dependencies of each model and then recursively builds the 'reverse' map of dependencies to get all modules and tests
impacted by a given file. We then only keep the tests (and only the core models tests if there are too many modules).

Caveats:
  - This module only filters tests by files (not individual tests) so it's better to have tests for different things
    in different files.
  - This module assumes inits are just importing things, not really building objects, so it's better to structure
    them this way and move objects building in separate submodules.

Usage:

Base use to fetch the tests in a pull request

```bash
python utils/tests_fetcher.py
```

Base use to fetch the tests on a the main branch (with diff from the last commit):

```bash
python utils/tests_fetcher.py --diff_with_last_commit
```

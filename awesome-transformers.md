# Awesome projects built with Transformers

This page lists awesome projects built on top of Transformers. Transformers is more than a toolkit to use pretrained
models: it's a community of projects built around it and the Hugging Face Hub. We want Transformers to enable
developers, researchers, students, professors, engineers, and anyone else to build their dream projects.

In this list, we showcase incredibly impactful and novel projects that have pushed the field forward. We celebrate
100 of these projects as we reach the milestone of 100k stars as a community; but we're very open to pull requests
adding other projects to the list. If you believe a project should be here and it's not, then please, open a PR 
to add it.

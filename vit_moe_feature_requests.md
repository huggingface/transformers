# ViT-MoE Feature Request Variants

## Variant 1: Enthusiastic Contributor

### Feature Request: Vision Transformer with Mixture of Experts (ViT-MoE)

#### Model Description
Hey! I'd love to contribute a Vision Transformer with Mixture of Experts (ViT-MoE) implementation to the library. Basically, it's a more efficient way to scale vision transformers by replacing those heavy dense feedforward layers with sparse experts that only activate when needed. Pretty cool stuff!

#### Research Papers
I've been diving deep into the recent research on this:

**Main papers I'm basing this on:**
- **ViMoE: An Empirical Study of Designing Vision Mixture-of-Experts** (just accepted to ICLR 2025!)
  - OpenReview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=KaYXsoCxV7
  - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03788

- **Google's V-MoE work** (the one that got everyone excited about vision MoE)
  - Blog post: https://research.google/blog/scaling-vision-with-sparse-mixture-of-experts/
  - arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05974

**Also found these really useful:**
- **Mobile V-MoEs** for edge deployment: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04354
- **MÂ³ViT** for multi-task learning: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14793

#### Why I Think This Would Be Awesome
The results from these papers are honestly pretty impressive:
- Google's V-MoE hits 90.35% on ImageNet while using about half the compute of dense models
- The routing gets smart - deeper layers start specializing in specific object classes without being told to!
- There's this neat "Batch Priority Routing" trick where you only process the most important 15-30% of image patches

I noticed we have great MoE support for text models (Mixtral, Switch Transformers, etc.) but nothing for vision yet. Seems like a gap worth filling, especially with all the recent interest in efficient vision models.

#### Implementation Plan
```python
from transformers import ViTMoEConfig, ViTMoEForImageClassification

config = ViTMoEConfig(
    image_size=224,
    patch_size=16,
    hidden_size=768,
    num_experts=8,
    num_experts_per_token=2,
    router_aux_loss_coef=0.001,
    router_jitter_noise=0.01,
)

model = ViTMoEForImageClassification(config)
```

#### Questions for the Team
1. **Structure**: New `vit_moe/` directory or extend existing ViT?
2. **Routing**: Top-1 or Top-2 routing approach?
3. **Expert placement**: All layers or configurable?
4. **Tasks**: Start with classification or include detection?
5. **Benchmarks**: ImageNet + what else?

#### My Commitment
I'm genuinely excited about this and ready to put in the work! Happy to write all necessary files, tests, documentation, and stick around for maintenance. ðŸš€

## Variant 2: Research-Focused Academic

### Feature Request: Implementing Vision Transformer with Mixture of Experts (ViT-MoE)

#### Background & Motivation
Following recent advances in sparse expert models, I'd like to propose implementing Vision Transformer with Mixture of Experts for the transformers library. Recent research demonstrates significant efficiency gains while maintaining competitive accuracy.

#### Key Research Foundations
**Primary Literature:**
- **ViMoE (ICLR 2025)**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03788 - Comprehensive empirical study of MoE integration in ViTs
- **Google V-MoE**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05974 - Foundational work achieving 90.35% ImageNet accuracy with 50% compute reduction
- **Mobile V-MoEs**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04354 - Efficient deployment strategies
- **MÂ³ViT**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14793 - Multi-task learning applications

#### Technical Architecture
The proposed implementation would integrate sparse MoE blocks into the standard ViT architecture:

1. **Expert Networks**: Replace dense FFN layers with learned mixture of expert MLPs
2. **Router Mechanism**: Top-K routing with load balancing (following established patterns from Mixtral/Switch Transformers)
3. **Training Stability**: Auxiliary losses and jitter noise for robust training
4. **Inference Optimization**: Optional Batch Priority Routing for efficiency

#### Implementation Specifications
```python
class ViTMoEConfig(PretrainedConfig):
    def __init__(
        self,
        num_experts: int = 8,
        num_experts_per_token: int = 2,
        router_aux_loss_coef: float = 0.001,
        expert_capacity_factor: float = 1.0,
        **kwargs
    ):
        # Configuration details
```

#### Research Questions for Maintainers
1. Integration approach: standalone model vs. configurable ViT extension?
2. Routing strategy preferences: consistency with existing MoE implementations?
3. Evaluation priorities: which vision benchmarks for validation?
4. Performance targets: accuracy/efficiency thresholds for acceptance?

#### Contribution Timeline
Prepared to implement following transformers conventions with comprehensive testing and documentation. Experience with existing MoE patterns in the codebase.

## Variant 3: Practical Developer

### Feature Request: ViT-MoE - Efficient Vision Transformers

#### What I Want to Build
I'm working on computer vision projects and keep hitting compute limitations with large ViTs. The recent MoE papers show you can get similar accuracy with way less computation, so I'd like to add ViT-MoE to transformers.

#### The Research Behind It
These papers convinced me this is worth doing:
- **ViMoE** (ICLR 2025): https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03788 - shows how to properly integrate MoE into ViT
- **Google V-MoE**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05974 - 15B parameter model that's actually efficient
- **Mobile V-MoEs**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04354 - proves it works on smaller models too

#### Why This Makes Sense Now
- We already have solid MoE infrastructure (Mixtral, Switch Transformers work great)
- Vision models are getting huge and expensive to run
- Recent papers show this actually works well, not just theoretical
- Gap in the library - no vision MoE models yet

#### What I'm Proposing
```python
# Simple API following existing patterns
from transformers import ViTMoEForImageClassification, ViTMoEConfig

config = ViTMoEConfig(num_experts=8, experts_per_token=2)
model = ViTMoEForImageClassification(config)

# Should work with existing image processing
from transformers import ViTImageProcessor
processor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained("google/vit-base-patch16-224")
```

#### Implementation Approach
Planning to follow the existing MoE patterns pretty closely:
- Use the same router design as Mixtral (Top-2 routing)
- Keep load balancing loss and training tricks
- Make it compatible with current ViT image processing
- Start with ImageNet classification, expand from there

#### Questions
1. Better as new model (`models/vit_moe/`) or add MoE config to existing ViT?
2. Should I match Mixtral's routing exactly or adapt for vision specifics?
3. Any preference on which layers get MoE vs stay dense?
4. Want me to implement detection/segmentation variants too, or nail classification first?

#### Timeline & Commitment
I've got time to work on this properly - not a weekend hack. Happy to:
- Follow all the testing and documentation standards
- Stick around for bug fixes and improvements
- Add conversion scripts if pretrained weights become available

Let me know if this sounds useful! I think it fills a real gap and the research backing is solid.

## Variant 4: Community-Oriented Contributor

### Feature Request: Adding ViT-MoE for the Community ðŸ¤—

#### Hey Transformers Team!

I've been seeing a lot of community interest in efficient vision models lately, and I think ViT-MoE could be a great addition that many people would find useful.

#### What's ViT-MoE and Why Now?
Vision Transformer with Mixture of Experts basically makes ViTs way more efficient by using sparse experts instead of dense layers. The timing feels right because:

- Recent papers show it actually works well (not just academic theory)
- People are asking for efficient vision models more and more
- We have great MoE infrastructure already, just missing vision models
- Mobile/edge deployment is getting more important

#### The Research That Got Me Excited
- **ViMoE (ICLR 2025)**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03788 - really thorough study of how to do this right
- **Google V-MoE**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05974 - showed it scales to huge models
- **Mobile V-MoEs**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04354 - proves it works for smaller models too
- **MÂ³ViT**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14793 - multi-task applications

The Google results especially caught my attention - 90%+ ImageNet accuracy while using half the compute!

#### What Users Would Get
```python
# Familiar API, just more efficient
from transformers import ViTMoEForImageClassification, AutoImageProcessor

model = ViTMoEForImageClassification.from_pretrained("vit-moe-base")
processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("vit-moe-base")

# Works with pipelines too
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("image-classification", model=model, image_processor=processor)
```

#### Community Benefits
- **Researchers**: Can experiment with larger vision models on limited compute
- **Practitioners**: Deploy more capable models in production with same resources

- **Students**: Learn about sparse models with working examples

#### My Plan
I want to implement this following the community standards:
- Clean, readable code following existing MoE patterns
- Comprehensive tests and documentation
- Examples and model cards
- Integration with existing pipelines and tools

#### Questions for You
1. Would `models/vit_moe/` be the right place, or should this extend existing ViT?
2. Any specific MoE routing preferences to stay consistent with other models?
3. Should I prioritize ImageNet classification first or include other vision tasks?
4. What evaluation would be most convincing for the community?

#### My Commitment to the Community
I'm not just looking to dump code and disappear! I'm committed to:
- Proper implementation following all guidelines
- Responsive to feedback during review
- Long-term maintenance and improvements
- Helping users who have questions

I think this could be really valuable for the community - efficient vision models seem to be exactly what people are asking for these days. What do you think?

            " by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions. Let us address some of these: ."
            " The most misleading assertion, despite universal rejection by experts, is that the negotiations'"
            " objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in Iran. That is the position"
            " of Netanyahu and his acolytes in the U.S. Congress. But that is not and never was the objective. If it"
            " had been, there would have been no Iranian team at the negotiating table. Rather, the objective has"
            " always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that Iran could not covertly develop a"
            " nuclear arsenal before the United States and its allies could respond. The new framework has exceeded"
            " expectations in achieving that goal. It would reduce Iran's low-enriched uranium stockpile, cut by"
            " two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime. Another"
            " dubious assumption of opponents is that the Iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program. Despite"
            " sharp accusations by some in the United States and its allies, Iran denies having such a program, and"
            " U.S. intelligence contends that Iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon. Iran's"
            " continued cooperation with International Atomic Energy Agency inspections is further evidence on this"
            " point, and we'll know even more about Iran's program in the coming months and years because of the deal."
            " In fact, the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any"
            " covert action by the Iranians. What's more, the rhetoric of some members of Congress has implied that"
            " the negotiations have been between only the United States and Iran (i.e., the 47 senators' letter"
            " warning that a deal might be killed by Congress or a future president). This of course is not the case."
            " The talks were between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (United States,"
            " United Kingdom, France, China and Russia) plus Germany, dubbed the P5+1. While the United States has"
            " played a leading role in the effort, it negotiated the terms alongside its partners. If the agreement"
            " reached by the P5+1 is rejected by Congress, it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on Iran"
            " and threaten NATO cohesion in other areas. Another questionable assertion is that this agreement"
            " contains a sunset clause, after which Iran will be free to do as it pleases. Again, this is not the"
            " case. Some of the restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities, such as uranium enrichment, will be eased"
            " or eliminated over time, as long as 15 years. But most importantly, the framework agreement includes"
            " Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol, which allows IAEA inspectors expanded access to nuclear"
            " sites both declared and nondeclared. This provision will be permanent. It does not sunset. Thus, going"
            " forward, if Iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels, monitors will be able to detect such"
            " a move in a matter of days and alert the U.N. Security Council. Many in Congress have said that the"
            ' agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the Senate to "advise and consent." But the issue is not'
            " suited for a treaty. Treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories. For example, the New"
            " START treaty limits Russia and the United States to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads. But any agreement"
            " with Iran will not be so balanced.  The restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement"
            " will be imposed almost exclusively on Iran. The P5+1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove"
            " most but not all economic sanctions, which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal. Finally"
            " some insist that any agreement must address Iranian missile programs, human rights violations or support"
            " for Hamas or Hezbollah.  As important as these issues are, and they must indeed be addressed, they are"
            " unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal: preventing a nuclear Iran.  To include them in"
            " the negotiations would be a poison pill. This agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it"
            " affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies, including Israel. Those judgments should be"

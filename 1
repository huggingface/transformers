Scene title: "Юрец в машине — M5 урчит"

[Background]
Interior of a BMW M5 with the engine idling. Deep, bassy rumble of the motor, slightly muffled by the cabin. 
Light air vent noise, small vibrations, and faint street sounds through a half-open window.

[Timing]
0:00–0:03 — ambient car interior sound, deep idle rumble of the M5 engine.
0:03–0:06 — a male Russian voice, speaking from outside the car, about 3–5 meters away. His tone is friendly, a little loud, slightly muffled by distance and the car cabin.
He says:
"Юрец, братко! Ты калик будешь? Стол уже накрыт!"
0:06–0:10 — silence from the person recording, only the steady engine rumble and soft cabin ambience until fade out.

- Keep the natural low-end resonance of the BMW M5 engine.
- Atmosphere should feel realistic, as if recorded on a smartphone from inside the car.
- Duration: about 10 seconds.
- Language of the spoken line: Russian.
- Tone: friendly, casual, humorous.

            [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)

            Bart uses the `eos_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If `past_key_values`
            is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see `past_key_values`).

            For translation and summarization training, `decoder_input_ids` should be provided. If no
            `decoder_input_ids` is provided, the model will create this tensor by shifting the `input_ids` to the right
            for denoising pre-training following the paper.
        decoder_attention_mask (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
            be used by default.

            If you want to change padding behavior, you should read [`modeling_bart._prepare_decoder_attention_mask`]
            and modify to your needs. See diagram 1 in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) for more
            information on the default strategy.
        encoder_outputs (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*):

            `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
            hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
        past_key_values (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`):
            Tuple of `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2 tensors of shape
            `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and 2 additional tensors of shape
            `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

            Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention
            blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

            If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids` (those that
            don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all
            `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
        inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape`(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
            is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
            model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
        decoder_inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
            representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
            input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
            `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

            If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value
            of `inputs_embeds`.

            If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see

                except for `decoder_input_ids` which will only be passed through the text components.
                - With a *text_* or *speech_* prefix, they will be input for the `generate` method of the
                text model and speech model respectively. It has the priority over the keywords without a prefix.

                This means you can, for example, specify a generation strategy for one generation but not for the
                other.

HIFIGAN_START_DOCSTRING = r"""
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`SeamlessM4Tv2Config`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

        Generates sequences of token ids.

        <Tip warning={true}>

        Most generation-controlling parameters are set in `generation_config` which, if not passed, will be set to the
        model's default generation configuration. You can override any `generation_config` by passing the corresponding
        parameters to generate(), e.g. `.generate(inputs, num_beams=4, do_sample=True)`.

        For an overview of generation strategies and code examples, check out the [following
        guide](./generation_strategies).

        </Tip>

        Parameters:
            input_ids (`torch.Tensor` of varying shape depending on the modality, *optional*):
                Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

                Indices can be obtained using [`SeamlessM4TTokenizer`] or [`SeamlessM4TProcessor`]. See
                [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.

                [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
            tgt_lang (`str`, *optional*):
                The language to use as target language for translation.
            generation_config (`~generation.GenerationConfig`, *optional*):
                The generation configuration to be used as base parametrization for the generation call. `**kwargs`
                passed to generate matching the attributes of `generation_config` will override them. If
                `generation_config` is not provided, the default will be used, which had the following loading
                priority: 1) from the `generation_config.json` model file, if it exists; 2) from the model
                configuration. Please note that unspecified parameters will inherit [`~generation.GenerationConfig`]'s
                default values, whose documentation should be checked to parameterize generation.
            logits_processor (`LogitsProcessorList`, *optional*):
                Custom logits processors that complement the default logits processors built from arguments and
                generation config. If a logit processor is passed that is already created with the arguments or a
                generation config an error is thrown. This feature is intended for advanced users.
            stopping_criteria (`StoppingCriteriaList`, *optional*):
                Custom stopping criteria that complement the default stopping criteria built from arguments and a
                generation config. If a stopping criteria is passed that is already created with the arguments or a
                generation config an error is thrown. This feature is intended for advanced users.
            prefix_allowed_tokens_fn (`Callable[[int, torch.Tensor], List[int]]`, *optional*):
                If provided, this function constraints the beam search to allowed tokens only at each step. If not
                provided no constraint is applied. This function takes 2 arguments: the batch ID `batch_id` and
                `input_ids`. It has to return a list with the allowed tokens for the next generation step conditioned
                on the batch ID `batch_id` and the previously generated tokens `inputs_ids`. This argument is useful
                for constrained generation conditioned on the prefix, as described in [Autoregressive Entity
                Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00904).
            synced_gpus (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to continue running the while loop until max_length (needed to avoid deadlocking with
                `FullyShardedDataParallel` and DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3).
            kwargs (`Dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
                Ad hoc parametrization of `generate_config` and/or additional model-specific kwargs that will be
                forwarded to the `forward` function of the model.

        Return:
            [`~utils.ModelOutput`] or `torch.LongTensor`: A [`~utils.ModelOutput`] (if `return_dict_in_generate=True`
            or when `config.return_dict_in_generate=True`) or a `torch.FloatTensor`. The possible

        Generates sequences of token ids.

        <Tip warning={true}>

        Most generation-controlling parameters are set in `generation_config` which, if not passed, will be set to the
        model's default generation configuration. You can override any `generation_config` by passing the corresponding
        parameters to generate(), e.g. `.generate(inputs, num_beams=4, do_sample=True)`.

        For an overview of generation strategies and code examples, check out the [following
        guide](./generation_strategies).

        </Tip>

        Parameters:
            input_features (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_banks)`):
                Input audio features. This should be returnes by the [`SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor`] class or the
                [`SeamlessM4TProcessor`] class. See [`SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor.__call__`] for details.

            tgt_lang (`str`, *optional*):
                The language to use as target language for translation.
            generation_config (`~generation.GenerationConfig`, *optional*):
                The generation configuration to be used as base parametrization for the generation call. `**kwargs`
                passed to generate matching the attributes of `generation_config` will override them. If
                `generation_config` is not provided, the default will be used, which had the following loading
                priority: 1) from the `generation_config.json` model file, if it exists; 2) from the model
                configuration. Please note that unspecified parameters will inherit [`~generation.GenerationConfig`]'s
                default values, whose documentation should be checked to parameterize generation.
            logits_processor (`LogitsProcessorList`, *optional*):
                Custom logits processors that complement the default logits processors built from arguments and
                generation config. If a logit processor is passed that is already created with the arguments or a
                generation config an error is thrown. This feature is intended for advanced users.
            stopping_criteria (`StoppingCriteriaList`, *optional*):
                Custom stopping criteria that complement the default stopping criteria built from arguments and a
                generation config. If a stopping criteria is passed that is already created with the arguments or a
                generation config an error is thrown. This feature is intended for advanced users.
            prefix_allowed_tokens_fn (`Callable[[int, torch.Tensor], List[int]]`, *optional*):
                If provided, this function constraints the beam search to allowed tokens only at each step. If not
                provided no constraint is applied. This function takes 2 arguments: the batch ID `batch_id` and
                `input_ids`. It has to return a list with the allowed tokens for the next generation step conditioned
                on the batch ID `batch_id` and the previously generated tokens `inputs_ids`. This argument is useful
                for constrained generation conditioned on the prefix, as described in [Autoregressive Entity
                Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00904).
            synced_gpus (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to continue running the while loop until max_length (needed to avoid deadlocking with
                `FullyShardedDataParallel` and DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3).
            kwargs (`Dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
                Ad hoc parametrization of `generate_config` and/or additional model-specific kwargs that will be
                forwarded to the `forward` function of the model.

        Return:
            [`~utils.ModelOutput`] or `torch.LongTensor`: A [`~utils.ModelOutput`] (if `return_dict_in_generate=True`
            or when `config.return_dict_in_generate=True`) or a `torch.FloatTensor`. The possible
            [`~utils.ModelOutput`] types are:

        Generates translated audio waveforms.

        <Tip>

        This method successively calls the `.generate` function of two different sub-models. You can specify keyword
        arguments at two different levels: general arguments that will be passed to both models, or prefixed arguments
        that will be passed to one of them.

        For example, calling `.generate(input_ids, num_beams=4, speech_do_sample=True)` will successively perform
        beam-search decoding on the text model, and multinomial beam-search sampling on the speech model.

        For an overview of generation strategies and code examples, check out the [following
        guide](./generation_strategies).

        </Tip>

        Args:
            input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`):
                Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

                Indices can be obtained using [`SeamlessM4TTokenizer`] or [`SeamlessM4TProcessor`]. See
                [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.

                [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
            return_intermediate_token_ids (`bool`, *optional*):
                If `True`, also returns the intermediate generated text and unit tokens. Set to `True` if you also want
                to get translated text alongside the audio.
            tgt_lang (`str`, *optional*):
                The language to use as target language for translation.
            speaker_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
                The id of the speaker used for speech synthesis. Must be lower than `config.vocoder_num_spkrs`.
            kwargs (*optional*):
                Remaining dictionary of keyword arguments that will be passed to [`GenerationMixin.generate`]. Keyword
                arguments are of two types:

                    - Without a prefix, they will be entered as `**kwargs` for the `generate` method of each sub-model,
                    except for `decoder_input_ids` which will only be passed through the text components.
                    - With a *text_* or *speech_* prefix, they will be input for the `generate` method of the
                    text model and speech model respectively. It has the priority over the keywords without a prefix.

                    This means you can, for example, specify a generation strategy for one generation but not for the
                    other.


        Returns:

            - If not `return_intermediate_token_ids`, returns a tuple composed of waveforms of shape `(batch_size,
              sequence_length)`and and `waveform_lengths` which gives the length of each sample.

        Generates translated audio waveforms.

        <Tip>

        This method successively calls the `.generate` function of two different sub-models. You can specify keyword
        arguments at two different levels: general arguments that will be passed to both models, or prefixed arguments
        that will be passed to one of them.

        For example, calling `.generate(input_features, num_beams=4, speech_do_sample=True)` will successively perform
        beam-search decoding on the text model, and multinomial beam-search sampling on the speech model.

        For an overview of generation strategies and code examples, check out the [following
        guide](./generation_strategies).

        </Tip>

        Args:
            input_features (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_banks)`):
                Input audio features. This should be returnes by the [`SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor`] class or the
                [`SeamlessM4TProcessor`] class. See [`SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor.__call__`] for details.
            return_intermediate_token_ids (`bool`, *optional*):
                If `True`, also returns the intermediate generated text and unit tokens. Set to `True` if you also want
                to get translated text alongside the audio.
            tgt_lang (`str`, *optional*):
                The language to use as target language for translation.
            speaker_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
                The id of the speaker used for speech synthesis. Must be lower than `config.vocoder_num_spkrs`.

            kwargs (*optional*):
                Remaining dictionary of keyword arguments that will be passed to [`GenerationMixin.generate`]. Keyword
                arguments are of two types:

                    - Without a prefix, they will be entered as `**kwargs` for the `generate` method of each sub-model,
                    except for `decoder_input_ids` which will only be passed through the text components.
                    - With a *text_* or *speech_* prefix, they will be input for the `generate` method of the
                    text model and speech model respectively. It has the priority over the keywords without a prefix.

                    This means you can, for example, specify a generation strategy for one generation but not for the
                    other.


        Returns:
            `Union[SeamlessM4Tv2GenerationOutput, Tuple[Tensor]]`:
            - If `return_intermediate_token_ids`, returns [`SeamlessM4Tv2GenerationOutput`].
            - If not `return_intermediate_token_ids`, returns a tuple composed of waveforms of shape `(batch_size,
              sequence_length)`and and `waveform_lengths` which gives the length of each sample.

        Generates translated token ids and/or translated audio waveforms.

        <Tip>

        This method successively calls the `.generate` function of two different sub-models. You can specify keyword
        arguments at two different levels: general arguments that will be passed to both models, or prefixed arguments
        that will be passed to one of them.

        For example, calling `.generate(input_ids=input_ids, num_beams=4, speech_do_sample=True)` will successively
        perform beam-search decoding on the text model, and multinomial beam-search sampling on the speech model.

        For an overview of generation strategies and code examples, check out the [following
        guide](./generation_strategies).

        </Tip>


        Args:
            input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
                Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

                Indices can be obtained using [`SeamlessM4TTokenizer`] or [`SeamlessM4TProcessor`]. See
                [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.

                [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
            input_features (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_banks)`, *optional*):
                Input audio features. This should be returnes by the [`SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor`] class or the
                [`SeamlessM4TProcessor`] class. See [`SeamlessM4TFeatureExtractor.__call__`] for details.
            return_intermediate_token_ids (`bool`, *optional*):
                If `True`, also returns the intermediate generated text and unit tokens. Set to `True` if you also want
                to get translated text alongside the audio. Note that if `generate_speech=True`, this parameter will be
                ignored.
            tgt_lang (`str`, *optional*):
                The language to use as target language for translation.
            speaker_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
                The id of the speaker used for speech synthesis. Must be lower than `config.vocoder_num_spkrs`.
            generate_speech (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                If `False`, will only returns the text tokens and won't generate speech.

            kwargs (*optional*):
                Remaining dictioy of keyword arguments that will be passed to [`GenerationMixin.generate`]. Keyword
                arguments are of two types:

                    - Without a prefix, they will be entered as `**kwargs` for the `generate` method of each sub-model,
                    except for `decoder_input_ids` which will only be passed through the text components.
                    - With a *text_* or *speech_* prefix, they will be input for the `generate` method of the
                    text model and speech model respectively. It has the priority over the keywords without a prefix.

                    This means you can, for example, specify a generation strategy for one generation but not for the
                    other.

        Returns:
            `Union[SeamlessM4Tv2GenerationOutput, Tuple[Tensor], ModelOutput]`:
            - If `generate_speech` and `return_intermediate_token_ids`, returns [`SeamlessM4Tv2GenerationOutput`].
            - If `generate_speech` and not `return_intermediate_token_ids`, returns a tuple composed of waveforms of
              shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`and and `waveform_lengths` which gives the length of each sample.
            - If `generate_speech=False`, it will returns `ModelOutput`.

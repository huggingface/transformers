    This model inherits from :class:`~transformers.TFPreTrainedModel`. Check the superclass documentation for the
    generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input
    embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

    This model is also a `tf.keras.Model <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model>`__ subclass. Use
    it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    .. note::

        TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

        - having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
        - having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

        This second option is useful when using :meth:`tf.keras.Model.fit` method which currently requires having all
        the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: :obj:`model(inputs)`.

        If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in
        the first positional argument :

        - a single Tensor with :obj:`input_ids` only and nothing else: :obj:`model(inputs_ids)`
        - a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
          :obj:`model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or :obj:`model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
        - a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
          :obj:`model({"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

    Parameters:
        config (:class:`~transformers.LongformerConfig`): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the :meth:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` method to load the model
            weights.

        global_attention_mask (:obj:`tf.Tensor` of shape :obj:`({0})`, `optional`):
            Mask to decide the attention given on each token, local attention or global attention. Tokens with global
            attention attends to all other tokens, and all other tokens attend to them. This is important for
            task-specific finetuning because it makes the model more flexible at representing the task. For example,
            for classification, the <s> token should be given global attention. For QA, all question tokens should also
            have global attention. Please refer to the `Longformer paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150>`__ for more
            details. Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:

            - 0 for local attention (a sliding window attention),
            - 1 for global attention (tokens that attend to all other tokens, and all other tokens attend to them).

        token_type_ids (:obj:`tf.Tensor` of shape :obj:`({0})`, `optional`):
            Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in ``[0,
            1]``:

            - 0 corresponds to a `sentence A` token,
            - 1 corresponds to a `sentence B` token.

            `What are token type IDs? <../glossary.html#token-type-ids>`__
        position_ids (:obj:`tf.Tensor` of shape :obj:`({0})`, `optional`):
            Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range ``[0,
            config.max_position_embeddings - 1]``.

            `What are position IDs? <../glossary.html#position-ids>`__
        inputs_embeds (:obj:`tf.Tensor` of shape :obj:`({0}, hidden_size)`, `optional`):
            Optionally, instead of passing :obj:`input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
            This is useful if you want more control over how to convert :obj:`input_ids` indices into associated
            vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
        output_attentions (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See ``attentions`` under returned
            tensors for more detail.
        output_hidden_states (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See ``hidden_states`` under returned tensors for
            more detail.
        return_dict (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            Whether or not to return a :class:`~transformers.file_utils.ModelOutput` instead of a plain tuple.
        training (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to use the model in training mode (some modules like dropout modules have different
            behaviors between training and evaluation).

    This class copies code from :class:`~transformers.TFRobertaModel` and overwrites standard self-attention with
    longformer self-attention to provide the ability to process long sequences following the self-attention approach
    described in `Longformer: the Long-Document Transformer <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150>`__ by Iz Beltagy,
    Matthew E. Peters, and Arman Cohan. Longformer self-attention combines a local (sliding window) and global
    attention to extend to long documents without the O(n^2) increase in memory and compute.

    The self-attention module :obj:`TFLongformerSelfAttention` implemented here supports the combination of local and
    global attention but it lacks support for autoregressive attention and dilated attention. Autoregressive and
    dilated attention are more relevant for autoregressive language modeling than finetuning on downstream tasks.
    Future release will add support for autoregressive attention, but the support for dilated attention requires a
    custom CUDA kernel to be memory and compute efficient.

    Creates a frequency bin conversion matrix used to obtain a mel spectrogram. This is called a *mel filter bank*, and
    various implementation exist, which differ in the number of filters, the shape of the filters, the way the filters
    are spaced, the bandwidth of the filters, and the manner in which the spectrum is warped. The goal of these
    features is to approximate the non-linear human perception of the variation in pitch with respect to the frequency.

    Different banks of mel filters were introduced in the literature. The following variations are supported:

    - MFCC FB-20: introduced in 1980 by Davis and Mermelstein, it assumes a sampling frequency of 10 kHz and a speech
      bandwidth of `[0, 4600]` Hz.
    - MFCC FB-24 HTK: from the Cambridge HMM Toolkit (HTK) (1995) uses a filter bank of 24 filters for a speech
      bandwidth of `[0, 8000]` Hz. This assumes sampling rate ≥ 16 kHz.
    - MFCC FB-40: from the Auditory Toolbox for MATLAB written by Slaney in 1998, assumes a sampling rate of 16 kHz and
      speech bandwidth of `[133, 6854]` Hz. This version also includes area normalization.
    - HFCC-E FB-29 (Human Factor Cepstral Coefficients) of Skowronski and Harris (2004), assumes a sampling rate of
      12.5 kHz and speech bandwidth of `[0, 6250]` Hz.

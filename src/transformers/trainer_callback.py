class TrainerState:
    """
    A class containing the [`Trainer`] inner state that will be saved along the model and optimizer when checkpointing
    and passed to the [`TrainerCallback`].

    <Tip>

    In all this class, one step is to be understood as one update step. When using gradient accumulation, one update
    step may require several forward and backward passes: if you use `gradient_accumulation_steps=n`, then one update
    step requires going through *n* batches.

    </Tip>

    Args:
        epoch (`float`, *optional*):
            Only set during training, will represent the epoch the training is at (the decimal part being the
            percentage of the current epoch completed).
        global_step (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
            During training, represents the number of update steps completed.
        max_steps (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
            The number of update steps to do during the current training.
        logging_steps (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 500):
            Log every X updates steps
        eval_steps (`int`, *optional*):
            Run an evaluation every X steps.
        save_steps (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 500):
            Save checkpoint every X updates steps.
        train_batch_size (`int`, *optional*):
            The batch size for the training dataloader. Only needed when
            `auto_find_batch_size` has been used.
        num_input_tokens_seen (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
            When tracking the inputs tokens, the number of tokens seen during training (number of input tokens, not the
            number of prediction tokens).
        total_flos (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
            The total number of floating operations done by the model since the beginning of training (stored as floats
            to avoid overflow).
        log_history (`List[Dict[str, float]]`, *optional*):
            The list of logs done since the beginning of training.
        best_metric (`float`, *optional*):
            When tracking the best model, the value of the best metric encountered so far.
        best_model_checkpoint (`str`, *optional*):
            When tracking the best model, the value of the name of the checkpoint for the best model encountered so
            far.
        is_local_process_zero (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not this process is the local (e.g., on one machine if training in a distributed fashion on
            several machines) main process.
        is_world_process_zero (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not this process is the global main process (when training in a distributed fashion on several
            machines, this is only going to be `True` for one process).
        is_hyper_param_search (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether we are in the process of a hyper parameter search using Trainer.hyperparameter_search. This will
            impact the way data will be logged in TensorBoard.
        stateful_callbacks (`List[StatefulTrainerCallback]`, *optional*):
            Callbacks attached to the `Trainer` that should have their states be saved or restored.
            Relevent callbacks should implement a `state` and `from_state` function.

    A class for objects that will inspect the state of the training loop at some events and take some decisions. At
    each of those events the following arguments are available:

    Args:
        args ([`TrainingArguments`]):
            The training arguments used to instantiate the [`Trainer`].
        state ([`TrainerState`]):
            The current state of the [`Trainer`].
        control ([`TrainerControl`]):
            The object that is returned to the [`Trainer`] and can be used to make some decisions.
        model ([`PreTrainedModel`] or `torch.nn.Module`):
            The model being trained.
        tokenizer ([`PreTrainedTokenizer`]):
            The tokenizer used for encoding the data. This is deprecated in favour of `processing_class`.
        processing_class ([`PreTrainedTokenizer` or `BaseImageProcessor` or `ProcessorMixin` or `FeatureExtractionMixin`]):
            The processing class used for encoding the data. Can be a tokenizer, a processor, an image processor or a feature extractor.
        optimizer (`torch.optim.Optimizer`):
            The optimizer used for the training steps.
        lr_scheduler (`torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR`):
            The scheduler used for setting the learning rate.

            The current dataloader used for training.
        eval_dataloader (`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, *optional*):
            The current dataloader used for evaluation.
        metrics (`Dict[str, float]`):
            The metrics computed by the last evaluation phase.

            Those are only accessible in the event `on_evaluate`.
        logs  (`Dict[str, float]`):
            The values to log.

            Those are only accessible in the event `on_log`.

    The `control` object is the only one that can be changed by the callback, in which case the event that changes it
    should return the modified version.

    The argument `args`, `state` and `control` are positionals for all events, all the others are grouped in `kwargs`.
    You can unpack the ones you need in the signature of the event using them. As an example, see the code of the
    simple [`~transformers.PrinterCallback`].

        Instantiate a pretrained flax model from a pre-trained model configuration.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not initialized from pretrained model* means that the weights of XXX do not come
        pretrained with the rest of the model. It is up to you to train those weights with a downstream fine-tuning
        task.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not used in YYY* means that the layer XXX is not used by YYY, therefore those
        weights are discarded.

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`):
                Can be either:

                    - A string, the *model id* of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co.
                    - A path to a *directory* containing model weights saved using
                      [`~FlaxPreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], e.g., `./my_model_directory/`.
                    - A path or url to a *pt index checkpoint file* (e.g, `./tf_model/model.ckpt.index`). In this case,
                      `from_pt` should be set to `True`.
            dtype (`jax.numpy.dtype`, *optional*, defaults to `jax.numpy.float32`):
                The data type of the computation. Can be one of `jax.numpy.float32`, `jax.numpy.float16` (on GPUs) and
                `jax.numpy.bfloat16` (on TPUs).

                This can be used to enable mixed-precision training or half-precision inference on GPUs or TPUs. If
                specified all the computation will be performed with the given `dtype`.

                **Note that this only specifies the dtype of the computation and does not influence the dtype of model
                parameters.**

                If you wish to change the dtype of the model parameters, see [`~FlaxPreTrainedModel.to_fp16`] and
                [`~FlaxPreTrainedModel.to_bf16`].
            model_args (sequence of positional arguments, *optional*):
                All remaining positional arguments will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` method.
            config (`Union[PretrainedConfig, str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - an instance of a class derived from [`PretrainedConfig`],
                    - a string or path valid as input to [`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`].

                Configuration for the model to use instead of an automatically loaded configuration. Configuration can
                be automatically loaded when:

                    - The model is a model provided by the library (loaded with the *model id* string of a pretrained
                      model).
                    - The model was saved using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`] and is reloaded by supplying the
                      save directory.
                    - The model is loaded by supplying a local directory as `pretrained_model_name_or_path` and a
                      configuration JSON file named *config.json* is found in the directory.
            cache_dir (`Union[str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            from_pt (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a PyTorch checkpoint save file (see docstring of
                `pretrained_model_name_or_path` argument).
            ignore_mismatched_sizes (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to raise an error if some of the weights from the checkpoint do not have the same size
                as the weights of the model (if for instance, you are instantiating a model with 10 labels from a
                checkpoint with 3 labels).
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download of the model weights and configuration files, overriding the
                cached versions if they exist.
            resume_download:
                Deprecated and ignored. All downloads are now resumed by default when possible.
                Will be removed in v5 of Transformers.
            proxies (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            local_files_only(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to only look at local files (i.e., do not try to download the model).
            token (`str` or `bool`, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, or not specified, will use
                the token generated when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.


                <Tip>

                To test a pull request you made on the Hub, you can pass `revision="refs/pr/<pr_number>"`.

                </Tip>

            subfolder (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
                In case the relevant files are located inside a subfolder of the model repo on huggingface.co, you can
                specify the folder name here.
            kwargs (remaining dictionary of keyword arguments, *optional*):
                Can be used to update the configuration object (after it being loaded) and initiate the model (e.g.,
                `output_attentions=True`). Behaves differently depending on whether a `config` is provided or
                automatically loaded:

                    - If a configuration is provided with `config`, `**kwargs` will be directly passed to the
                      underlying model's `__init__` method (we assume all relevant updates to the configuration have
                      already been done)
                    - If a configuration is not provided, `kwargs` will be first passed to the configuration class
                      initialization function ([`~PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`]). Each key of `kwargs` that
                      corresponds to a configuration attribute will be used to override said attribute with the
                      supplied `kwargs` value. Remaining keys that do not correspond to any configuration attribute
                      will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` function.

        Examples:

        ```python
        >>> from transformers import BertConfig, FlaxBertModel

        >>> # Download model and configuration from huggingface.co and cache.
        >>> model = FlaxBertModel.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-cased")
        >>> # Model was saved using *save_pretrained('./test/saved_model/')* (for example purposes, not runnable).
        >>> model = FlaxBertModel.from_pretrained("./test/saved_model/")
        >>> # Loading from a PyTorch checkpoint file instead of a PyTorch model (slower, for example purposes, not runnable).
        >>> config = BertConfig.from_json_file("./pt_model/config.json")

        Arguments:
            save_directory (`str` or `os.PathLike`):
                Directory to which to save. Will be created if it doesn't exist.
            push_to_hub (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to push your model to the Hugging Face model hub after saving it. You can specify the
                repository you want to push to with `repo_id` (will default to the name of `save_directory` in your
                namespace).
            max_shard_size (`int` or `str`, *optional*, defaults to `"10GB"`):
                The maximum size for a checkpoint before being sharded. Checkpoints shard will then be each of size
                lower than this size. If expressed as a string, needs to be digits followed by a unit (like `"5MB"`).

                <Tip warning={true}>

                If a single weight of the model is bigger than `max_shard_size`, it will be in its own checkpoint shard

            token (`str` or `bool`, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, or not specified, will use
                the token generated when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).

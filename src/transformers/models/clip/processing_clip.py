    Constructs a CLIP processor which wraps a CLIP image processor and a CLIP tokenizer into a single processor.

    [`CLIPProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`CLIPImageProcessor`] and [`CLIPTokenizerFast`]. See the
    [`~CLIPProcessor.__call__`] and [`~CLIPProcessor.decode`] for more information.

        image_processor ([`CLIPImageProcessor`], *optional*):
            The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer ([`AutoTokenizer`], *optional*):
            The tokenizer is a required input.

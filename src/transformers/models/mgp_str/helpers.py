    This is the same as the DropConnect impl I created for EfficientNet, etc networks, however, the original name is
    misleading as 'Drop Connect' is a different form of dropout in a separate paper... See discussion:
    https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/issues/494#issuecomment-532968956 ... I've opted for changing the layer and
    argument names to 'drop path' rather than mix DropConnect as a layer name and use 'survival rate' as the argument.

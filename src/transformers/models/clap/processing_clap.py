class ClapProcessor(ProcessorMixin):
    r"""
    Constructs a CLAP processor which wraps a CLAP feature extractor and a RoBerta tokenizer into a single processor.

    [`ClapProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`ClapFeatureExtractor`] and [`RobertaTokenizerFast`]. See the
    [`~ClapProcessor.__call__`] and [`~ClapProcessor.decode`] for more information.

    Args:
        feature_extractor ([`ClapFeatureExtractor`]):
            The audio processor is a required input.
        tokenizer ([`RobertaTokenizerFast`]):
            The tokenizer is a required input.

        Main method to prepare for the model one or several sequences(s) and audio(s). This method forwards the `text`
        and `kwargs` arguments to RobertaTokenizerFast's [`~RobertaTokenizerFast.__call__`] if `text` is not `None` to
        encode the text. To prepare the audio(s), this method forwards the `audios` and `kwrags` arguments to
        ClapFeatureExtractor's [`~ClapFeatureExtractor.__call__`] if `audios` is not `None`. Please refer to the
        docstring of the above two methods for more information.

        Args:
            text (`str`, `list[str]`, `list[list[str]]`):
                The sequence or batch of sequences to be encoded. Each sequence can be a string or a list of strings
                (pretokenized string). If the sequences are provided as list of strings (pretokenized), you must set
                `is_split_into_words=True` (to lift the ambiguity with a batch of sequences).
            audios (`np.ndarray`, `torch.Tensor`, `list[np.ndarray]`, `list[torch.Tensor]`):
                The audio or batch of audios to be prepared. Each audio can be NumPy array or PyTorch tensor. In case
                of a NumPy array/PyTorch tensor, each audio should be of shape (C, T), where C is a number of channels,
                and T the sample length of the audio.

            return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*):
                If set, will return tensors of a particular framework. Acceptable values are:

                - `'tf'`: Return TensorFlow `tf.constant` objects.
                - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
                - `'np'`: Return NumPy `np.ndarray` objects.
                - `'jax'`: Return JAX `jnp.ndarray` objects.

        Returns:
            [`BatchEncoding`]: A [`BatchEncoding`] with the following fields:

            - **input_ids** -- List of token ids to be fed to a model. Returned when `text` is not `None`.
            - **attention_mask** -- List of indices specifying which tokens should be attended to by the model (when
              `return_attention_mask=True` or if *"attention_mask"* is in `self.model_input_names` and if `text` is not
              `None`).
            - **audio_features** -- Audio features to be fed to a model. Returned when `audios` is not `None`.

                if they exist.
            proxies (`dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}.` The proxies are used on each request.

                when running `hf auth login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).

                If `False`, then this function returns just the final feature extractor object. If `True`, then this
                functions returns a `Tuple(feature_extractor, unused_kwargs)` where *unused_kwargs* is a dictionary
                consisting of the key/value pairs whose keys are not feature extractor attributes: i.e., the part of
                `kwargs` which has not been used to update `feature_extractor` and is otherwise ignored.
            trust_remote_code (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to allow for custom models defined on the Hub in their own modeling files. This option
                should only be set to `True` for repositories you trust and in which you have read the code, as it will
                execute code present on the Hub on your local machine.
            kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
                The values in kwargs of any keys which are feature extractor attributes will be used to override the
                loaded values. Behavior concerning key/value pairs whose keys are *not* feature extractor attributes is
                controlled by the `return_unused_kwargs` keyword parameter.

        Passing `token=True` is required when you want to use a private model.

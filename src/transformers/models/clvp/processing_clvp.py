    Constructs a CLVP processor which wraps a CLVP Feature Extractor and a CLVP Tokenizer into a single processor.

    [`ClvpProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`ClvpFeatureExtractor`] and [`ClvpTokenizer`]. See the
    [`~ClvpProcessor.__call__`], [`~ClvpProcessor.decode`] and [`~ClvpProcessor.batch_decode`] for more information.

        feature_extractor (`ClvpFeatureExtractor`):
            An instance of [`ClvpFeatureExtractor`]. The feature extractor is a required input.
        tokenizer (`ClvpTokenizer`):
            An instance of [`ClvpTokenizer`]. The tokenizer is a required input.

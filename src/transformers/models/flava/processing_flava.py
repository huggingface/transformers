    Constructs a FLAVA processor which wraps a FLAVA image processor and a FLAVA tokenizer into a single processor.

    [`FlavaProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`FlavaImageProcessor`] and [`BertTokenizerFast`]. See the

    Args:
        image_processor ([`FlavaImageProcessor`], *optional*): The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer ([`BertTokenizerFast`], *optional*): The tokenizer is a required input.

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`DetrConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Args:
        pixel_values (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_channels, height, width)`):
            Pixel values. Padding will be ignored by default should you provide it.

            Pixel values can be obtained using [`DetrFeatureExtractor`]. See [`DetrFeatureExtractor.__call__`] for
            details.

        pixel_mask (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, height, width)`, *optional*):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding pixel values. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 for pixels that are real (i.e. **not masked**),
            - 0 for pixels that are padding (i.e. **masked**).

            [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)

        decoder_attention_mask (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_queries)`, *optional*):
            Not used by default. Can be used to mask object queries.
        encoder_outputs (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*):
            Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, *optional*: `hidden_states`, *optional*: `attentions`)
            `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*) is a sequence of
            hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
        inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing the flattened feature map (output of the backbone + projection layer), you
            can choose to directly pass a flattened representation of an image.
        decoder_inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_queries, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of initializing the queries with a tensor of zeros, you can choose to directly pass an
            embedded representation.
        output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
            tensors for more detail.

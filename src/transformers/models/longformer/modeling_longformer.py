            attention_window + 1)`, where `x` is the number of tokens with global attention mask.

            Local attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
            self-attention heads. Those are the attention weights from every token in the sequence to every token with
            global attention (first `x` values) and to every token in the attention window (remaining `attention_window
            + 1` values). Note that the first `x` values refer to tokens with fixed positions in the text, but the
            remaining `attention_window + 1` values refer to tokens with relative positions: the attention weight of a
            token to itself is located at index `x + attention_window / 2` and the `attention_window / 2` preceding
            (succeeding) values are the attention weights to the `attention_window / 2` preceding (succeeding) tokens.
            If the attention window contains a token with global attention, the attention weight at the corresponding
            index is set to 0; the value should be accessed from the first `x` attention weights. If a token has global
            attention, the attention weights to all other tokens in `attentions` is set to 0, the values should be
            accessed from `global_attentions`.

        config ([`LongformerConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the

    Args:
        input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `({0})`):
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

            Indices can be obtained using [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and
            [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.

            [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
        attention_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `({0})`, *optional*):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
            - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

            [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
        global_attention_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `({0})`, *optional*):
            Mask to decide the attention given on each token, local attention or global attention. Tokens with global
            attention attends to all other tokens, and all other tokens attend to them. This is important for
            task-specific finetuning because it makes the model more flexible at representing the task. For example,
            for classification, the <s> token should be given global attention. For QA, all question tokens should also
            have global attention. Please refer to the [Longformer paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150) for more
            details. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 0 for local attention (a sliding window attention),
            - 1 for global attention (tokens that attend to all other tokens, and all other tokens attend to them).

        head_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*):
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the encoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

        decoder_head_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*):
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

        token_type_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `({0})`, *optional*):
            Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0,
            1]`:

            - 0 corresponds to a *sentence A* token,
            - 1 corresponds to a *sentence B* token.

            [What are token type IDs?](../glossary#token-type-ids)
        position_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `({0})`, *optional*):
            Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0,
            config.max_position_embeddings - 1]`.

            [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
        inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `({0}, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
            is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
            model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
        output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
            tensors for more detail.
        output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
            more detail.
        return_dict (`bool`, *optional*):

    The self-attention module `LongformerSelfAttention` implemented here supports the combination of local and global

    attention are more relevant for autoregressive language modeling than finetuning on downstream tasks. Future

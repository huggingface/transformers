    This model inherits from [`TFPreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use it
    as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage and
    behavior.

    <Tip>

    TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

    - having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
    - having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

    This second option is useful when using [`tf.keras.Model.fit`] method which currently requires having all the
    tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

    If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in the
    first positional argument :

    - a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)`
    - a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
    `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
    - a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring:
    `model({"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

    </Tip>

    Parameters:
        config ([`LongformerConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Args:
        input_ids (`tf.Tensor` of shape `({0})`):
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.

            Indices can be obtained using [`LongformerTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] and
            [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] for details.

            [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
        attention_mask (`tf.Tensor` of shape `({0})`, *optional*):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
            - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

            [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
        head_mask (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(encoder_layers, encoder_attention_heads)`, *optional*):
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

        global_attention_mask (`tf.Tensor` of shape `({0})`, *optional*):
            Mask to decide the attention given on each token, local attention or global attention. Tokens with global
            attention attends to all other tokens, and all other tokens attend to them. This is important for
            task-specific finetuning because it makes the model more flexible at representing the task. For example,
            for classification, the <s> token should be given global attention. For QA, all question tokens should also
            have global attention. Please refer to the [Longformer paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150) for more
            details. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 0 for local attention (a sliding window attention),
            - 1 for global attention (tokens that attend to all other tokens, and all other tokens attend to them).

        token_type_ids (`tf.Tensor` of shape `({0})`, *optional*):
            Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in `[0,
            1]`:

            - 0 corresponds to a *sentence A* token,
            - 1 corresponds to a *sentence B* token.

            [What are token type IDs?](../glossary#token-type-ids)
        position_ids (`tf.Tensor` of shape `({0})`, *optional*):
            Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range `[0,
            config.max_position_embeddings - 1]`.

            [What are position IDs?](../glossary#position-ids)
        inputs_embeds (`tf.Tensor` of shape `({0}, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
            is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
            model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
        output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
            tensors for more detail. This argument can be used only in eager mode, in graph mode the value in the
            config will be used instead.
        output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
            more detail. This argument can be used only in eager mode, in graph mode the value in the config will be
            used instead.
        return_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return a [`~file_utils.ModelOutput`] instead of a plain tuple. This argument can be used
            in eager mode, in graph mode the value will always be set to True.
        training (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to use the model in training mode (some modules like dropout modules have different
            behaviors between training and evaluation).

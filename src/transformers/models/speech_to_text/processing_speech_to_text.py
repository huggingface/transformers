    Constructs a Speech2Text processor which wraps a Speech2Text feature extractor and a Speech2Text tokenizer into a
    single processor.

    [`Speech2TextProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`Speech2TextFeatureExtractor`] and
    [`Speech2TextTokenizer`]. See the [`~Speech2TextProcessor.__call__`] and [`~Speech2TextProcessor.decode`] for more
    information.

            An instance of [`Speech2TextFeatureExtractor`]. The feature extractor is a required input.
        tokenizer (`Speech2TextTokenizer`):

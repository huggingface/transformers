    Constructs an X-CLIP processor which wraps a VideoMAE image processor and a CLIP tokenizer into a single processor.

    [`XCLIPProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`VideoMAEImageProcessor`] and [`CLIPTokenizerFast`]. See the
    [`~XCLIPProcessor.__call__`] and [`~XCLIPProcessor.decode`] for more information.

            The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer ([`CLIPTokenizerFast`], *optional*):
            The tokenizer is a required input.

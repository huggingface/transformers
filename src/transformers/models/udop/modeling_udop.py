    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Args:
        config ([`UdopConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.
"""


UDOP_INPUTS_DOCSTRING = r"""
    Args:
        input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`):
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. UDOP is a model with relative position embeddings so
            you should be able to pad the inputs on both the right and the left. Indices can be obtained using
            [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for detail.
            [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)

        attention_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
            - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
            [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)

        bbox (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `({0}, 4)`, *optional*):
            Bounding boxes of each input sequence tokens. Selected in the range `[0,
            config.max_2d_position_embeddings-1]`. Each bounding box should be a normalized version in (x0, y0, x1, y1)
            format, where (x0, y0) corresponds to the position of the upper left corner in the bounding box, and (x1,
            y1) represents the position of the lower right corner.

            Note that `sequence_length = token_sequence_length + patch_sequence_length + 1` where `1` is for [CLS]
            token. See `pixel_values` for `patch_sequence_length`.

        pixel_values (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_channels, height, width)`):
            Batch of document images. Each image is divided into patches of shape `(num_channels, config.patch_size,
            config.patch_size)` and the total number of patches (=`patch_sequence_length`) equals to `((height /
            config.patch_size) * (width / config.patch_size))`.

        visual_bbox (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, patch_sequence_length, 4)`, *optional*):
            Bounding boxes of each patch in the image. If not provided, bounding boxes are created in the model.

        decoder_input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Indices of decoder input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Indices can be obtained using
            [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.
            [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids) T5 uses the `pad_token_id` as the starting
            token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last
            `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see `past_key_values`). To know more on how to prepare
            `decoder_input_ids` for pretraining take a look at [T5 Training](./t5#training).
        decoder_attention_mask (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also
            be used by default.
        head_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*):
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules in the encoder. Mask values selected in `[0,
            1]`:
            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
        decoder_head_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*):
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0,
            1]`:
            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
        cross_attn_head_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_heads,)` or `(num_layers, num_heads)`, *optional*):
                Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in
                `[0, 1]`:
                - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
                - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
        encoder_outputs (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*):
            Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, `optional`: *hidden_states*, `optional`: *attentions*)
            `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` is a sequence of hidden states at
            the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
        past_key_values (`EncoderDecoderCache`, *optional*):
            Pre-computed hidden-states that can be used to speed up auto-regressive (sequential) decoding. There are
            four sets of pre-computed hidden-states: key and values states in the self-attention blocks (2) and
            in the cross-attention blocks (2). The `past_key_values` are returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or
            when `config.use_cache=True`. An [`~cache_utils.EncoderDecoderCache`] instance.

            If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids` (those
            that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of
            all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
        inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This
            is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the
            model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
        decoder_inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded
            representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be
            input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert
            `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix. If
            `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value of
            `inputs_embeds`.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*):
            If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
            `past_key_values`).
        output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned
            tensors for more detail.
        output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for
            more detail.
        return_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to return a [`~utils.ModelOutput`] instead of a plain tuple.
        cache_position (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Indices depicting the position of the input sequence tokens in the sequence. It is used to update the
            cache in the correct position and to infer the complete sequence length.

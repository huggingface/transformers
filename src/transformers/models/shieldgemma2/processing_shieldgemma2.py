                *   `custom_policies`: Additional policy definitions that augment the `self.policy_definitions` passed

                    will override the policy description

                    dictionary of specific interest for the provided images. If empty or None, prompts will be
                    generated for every key in the joint dictionary.

            A `BatchFeature` containing `input_ids`, `pixel_values`, etc. where each Tensor is of shape
            `(len(images) * len(policies), )`, and the order within the batch will be

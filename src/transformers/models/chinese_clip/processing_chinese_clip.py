    Constructs a Chinese-CLIP processor which wraps a Chinese-CLIP image processor and a Chinese-CLIP tokenizer into a
    single processor.

    [`ChineseCLIPProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`ChineseCLIPImageProcessor`] and [`BertTokenizerFast`].
    See the [`~ChineseCLIPProcessor.__call__`] and [`~ChineseCLIPProcessor.decode`] for more information.

        image_processor ([`ChineseCLIPImageProcessor`], *optional*):
            The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer ([`BertTokenizerFast`], *optional*):
            The tokenizer is a required input.

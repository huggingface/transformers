# Adding a new model

This page has been updated in light of the removal of the `add_new_model` script in favor of the more complete 
`add_new_model_like` script.

We recommend you check out the documentation on [how to add a model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/add_new_model) 
for complete and up-to-date instructions.

# Text classification with IMDb reviews

Text classification is a common NLP task that assigns a label or class to text. There are many practical applications of text classification widely used in production by some of today's largest companies. One of the most common forms of text classification is sentiment analysis, which assigns a label like positive, negative, or neutral to a sequence of text.

<Tip>

See the text classification [task page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-classification) for more information about other forms of text classification and its associated models, datasets, and metrics.

</Tip>

This guide will show you how to fine-tune a pretrained model on the [IMDb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb) dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative.

## Load IMDb dataset

The 🤗 Datasets library makes it simple to load the IMDb dataset:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset

>>> imdb = load_dataset("imdb")
```

Index into the `DatasetDict` object to view an example:

```py
imdb["test"][0]
{
    "label": 0,
    "text": "I love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot. Sci-fi movies/TV are usually underfunded, under-appreciated and misunderstood. I tried to like this, I really did, but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogues, CG that doesn't match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clichéd and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The makers of Earth KNOW it's rubbish as they have to always say \"Gene Roddenberry's Earth...\" otherwise people would not continue watching. Roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull, cheap, poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space. Spoiler. So, kill off a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas all over again.",
}
```

There are two fields in this dataset: 

- `text`: a string containing the text of the movie review.
- `label`: a value that can either be `0` for a negative review or a `1` for a positive review.

## Preprocess

Next, process the raw text into batches of tensors as inputs to the model. To ensure the inputs make sense, you must load the same vocabulary a pretrained model was trained with. Load the DistilBERT tokenizer because you will use a pretrained [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) model:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

Now that you have instantiated a tokenizer create a function that will tokenize and preprocess the text. Truncate any longer sequences of the text in your dataset to be no longer than DistilBERT's maximum input length:

```py
>>> def preprocess_function(examples):
...     return tokenizer(examples["text"], truncation=True)
```

Use 🤗 Datasets [`map`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html#datasets.Dataset.map) function to apply the preprocessing function to the entire dataset. You can also set `batched=True` to process multiple elements of the dataset at once for faster preprocessing:

```py
tokenized_imdb = imdb.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
```

Lastly, pad your text, so they are a uniform length. While it is possible to pad your text in the `tokenizer` function
by setting `padding=True`, it is more efficient to only pad the text to the length of the longest element in its
batch. This is known as *dynamic padding*, and the [`DataCollatorWithPadding`] function enables this technique:

```py
>>> from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding

>>> data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

## Fine-tune with `Trainer`

Now load DistilBERT with the [`AutoModelForSequenceClassification`] class along with the number of expected labels:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

>>> model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)
```

At this point, only three steps remain:

1. Define your training hyperparameters in [`TrainingArguments`].
2. Pass the training arguments to [`Trainer`] along with the model, dataset, tokenizer, and data collator.
3. Call [`~transformers.Trainer.train`] to fine-tune your model.

<Tip>

[`Trainer`] will apply dynamic padding by default when you pass `tokenizer` to it, to specify a data collator explicitly.

</Tip>

```py
>>> from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(
...     output_dir="./results",
...     learning_rate=2e-5,
...     per_device_train_batch_size=16,
...     per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
...     num_train_epochs=5,
...     weight_decay=0.01,
... )

>>> trainer = Trainer(
...     model=model,
...     args=training_args,
...     train_dataset=tokenized_imdb["train"],
...     eval_dataset=tokenized_imdb["test"],
...     tokenizer=tokenizer,
...     data_collator=data_collator,
... )

>>> trainer.train()
```

## Fine-tune with TensorFlow

To fine-tune a model in TensorFlow is just as easy, with only a few differences.

Start by batching the processed examples together with dynamic padding using the [`DataCollatorWithPadding`] function.
Make sure you set `return_tensors="tf"` to return `tf.Tensor` outputs instead of PyTorch tensors!

```py
>>> from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding

>>> data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer, return_tensors="tf")
```

Convert your datasets to the `tf.data.Dataset` format with [`to_tf_dataset`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html#datasets.Dataset.to_tf_dataset), and specify inputs and labels in the `columns` argument:

```py
>>> tf_train_dataset = tokenized_imdb["train"].to_tf_dataset(
...     columns=["attention_mask", "input_ids", "label"],
...     shuffle=True,
...     batch_size=16,
...     collate_fn=data_collator,
... )

>>> tf_validation_dataset = tokenized_imdb["train"].to_tf_dataset(
...     columns=["attention_mask", "input_ids", "label"],
...     shuffle=False,
...     batch_size=16,
...     collate_fn=data_collator,
... )
```

Set up an optimizer function, learning rate schedule, and some training hyperparameters:

```py
>>> from transformers import create_optimizer
>>> import tensorflow as tf

>>> batch_size = 16
>>> num_epochs = 5
>>> batches_per_epoch = len(tokenized_imdb["train"]) // batch_size
>>> total_train_steps = int(batches_per_epoch * num_epochs)
>>> optimizer, schedule = create_optimizer(init_lr=2e-5, num_warmup_steps=0, num_train_steps=total_train_steps)
```

Load DistilBERT with [`TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification`] along with the number of expected labels:

```py
>>> from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification

>>> model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)
```

Configure the model for training with [`compile`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#compile-method):

```py
>>> import tensorflow as tf

>>> model.compile(optimizer=optimizer)
```

Finally, fine-tune the model by calling [`fit`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#fit-method):

```py
>>> model.fit(
...     tf_train_set,
...     validation_data=tf_validation_set,
...     epochs=num_train_epochs,
... )
```

# Language modeling

Language modeling predicts words in a sentence. There are two forms of language modeling:

- Causal language modeling: predict the next token in a sequence of tokens, and the model can only attend to tokens on the left.
- Masked language modeling: predict a masked token in a sequence, and the model can attend to tokens bidirectionally.

This guide will show you how to fine-tune a pretrained model on the [r/askscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/) subset of the [ELI5](https://huggingface.co/datasets/eli5) dataset for both forms of language modeling.

<Tip>

See the text generation [task page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-generation) and fill mask [task page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/fill-mask) for more information about their associated models, datasets, and metrics.

</Tip>

## Load ELI5 dataset

Load only the first 5000 rows of the ELI5 dataset from the 🤗 Datasets library since it is pretty large:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset

>>> eli5 = load_dataset("eli5", split="train_asks[:5000]")
```

Split this dataset into a train and test set:

```py
eli5 = eli5.train_test_split(test_size=0.2)
```

Then take a look at an example:

```py
>>> eli5["train"][0]
{'answers': {'a_id': ['c3d1aib', 'c3d4lya'],
  'score': [6, 3],
  'text': ["The velocity needed to remain in orbit is equal to the square root of Newton's constant times the mass of earth divided by the distance from the center of the earth. I don't know the altitude of that specific mission, but they're usually around 300 km. That means he's going 7-8 km/s.\n\nIn space there are no other forces acting on either the shuttle or the guy, so they stay in the same position relative to each other. If he were to become unable to return to the ship, he would presumably run out of oxygen, or slowly fall into the atmosphere and burn up.",
   "Hope you don't mind me asking another question, but why aren't there any stars visible in this photo?"]},
 'answers_urls': {'url': []},
 'document': '',
 'q_id': 'nyxfp',
 'selftext': '_URL_0_\n\nThis was on the front page earlier and I have a few questions about it. Is it possible to calculate how fast the astronaut would be orbiting the earth? Also how does he stay close to the shuttle so that he can return safely, i.e is he orbiting at the same speed and can therefore stay next to it? And finally if his propulsion system failed, would he eventually re-enter the atmosphere and presumably die?',
 'selftext_urls': {'url': ['http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1201/freeflyer_nasa_3000.jpg']},
 'subreddit': 'askscience',
 'title': 'Few questions about this space walk photograph.',
 'title_urls': {'url': []}}
```

Notice `text` is a subfield that is nested inside `answers`. When you preprocess the dataset, you will need to extract the `text` subfield into a separate column.

## Preprocess

<Youtube id="8PmhEIXhBvI"/>

For causal language modeling, load the DistilGPT2 tokenizer to process the `text` subfield. To preprocess for masked language modeling, load the DistilRoBERTa tokenizer instead:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
# for causal language modeling

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilgpt2")
# for masked language modeling

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilroberta-base")
```

Extract the `text` subfield from its nested structure with the [`flatten`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/process.html#flatten) method:

```py
>>> eli5 = eli5.flatten()
>>> eli5["train"][0]
{'answers.a_id': ['c3d1aib', 'c3d4lya'],
 'answers.score': [6, 3],
 'answers.text': ["The velocity needed to remain in orbit is equal to the square root of Newton's constant times the mass of earth divided by the distance from the center of the earth. I don't know the altitude of that specific mission, but they're usually around 300 km. That means he's going 7-8 km/s.\n\nIn space there are no other forces acting on either the shuttle or the guy, so they stay in the same position relative to each other. If he were to become unable to return to the ship, he would presumably run out of oxygen, or slowly fall into the atmosphere and burn up.",
  "Hope you don't mind me asking another question, but why aren't there any stars visible in this photo?"],
 'answers_urls.url': [],
 'document': '',
 'q_id': 'nyxfp',
 'selftext': '_URL_0_\n\nThis was on the front page earlier and I have a few questions about it. Is it possible to calculate how fast the astronaut would be orbiting the earth? Also how does he stay close to the shuttle so that he can return safely, i.e is he orbiting at the same speed and can therefore stay next to it?

 'selftext_urls.url': ['http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1201/freeflyer_nasa_3000.jpg'],
 'subreddit': 'askscience',
 'title': 'Few questions about this space walk photograph.',
 'title_urls.url': []}
```

Each subfield is now a separate column as indicated by the `answers` prefix. When you tokenize the text, `answers.text` should be a string instead of a list. Create a preprocessing function to convert the list to a string and add a truncation strategy to truncate sequences to be no longer than DistilGPT2's maximum input length:

```py
>>> def preprocess_function(examples):
...     return tokenizer([" ".join(x) for x in examples["answers.text"]], truncation=True)
```

Use 🤗 Datasets [`map`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html#datasets.Dataset.map) function to apply the preprocessing function over the entire dataset. You can speed up the preprocessing by setting `batched=True` to process multiple elements of the dataset at once, and increasing the number of processes with `num_proc`. Remove the columns you don't need:

```py
>>> tokenized_eli5 = eli5.map(
...     preprocess_function,
...     batched=True,
...     num_proc=4,
...     remove_columns=eli5["train"].column_names,
... )
```

Now you need a second preprocessing function to preserve text in case a particular example is truncated because it is too long:

- Concatenate all the text.
- Split the concatenated text into smaller chunks defined by `block_size`.
- Create a copy of the inputs for the labels because the model shifts the labels to the right.

```py
>>> block_size = 128


>>> def group_texts(examples):
...     concatenated_examples = {k: sum(examples[k], []) for k in examples.keys()}
...     total_length = len(concatenated_examples[list(examples.keys())[0]])
...     total_length = (total_length // block_size) * block_size
...     result = {
...         k: [t[i : i + block_size] for i in range(0, total_length, block_size)]
...         for k, t in concatenated_examples.items()
...     }
...     result["labels"] = result["input_ids"].copy()
...     return result
```

Apply the `group_texts` function over the entire dataset, and speed up the operation by batching examples and increasing the number of processes:

```py
>>> lm_dataset = tokenized_eli5.map(group_texts, batched=True, num_proc=4)
```

## Causal language modeling

<Youtube id="Vpjb1lu0MDk"/>

Causal language modeling is often used for text generation. This section shows you how to fine-tune [DistilGPT2](https://huggingface.co/distilgpt2) to generate new text.

### Fine-tune with Trainer

Load DistilGPT2 with [`AutoModelForCausalLM`]:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, TrainingArguments, Trainer

>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("distilgpt2")
```

<Tip>

If you aren't familiar with fine-tuning a model with Trainer, take a look at the basic tutorial [here](training#finetune-with-trainer)!

</Tip>

At this point, only three steps remain:

1. Define your training hyperparameters in [`TrainingArguments`].
2. Pass the training arguments to [`Trainer`] along with the model and datasets.
3. Call [`~Trainer.train`] to fine-tune your model.

```py
>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(
...     output_dir="./results",
...     evaluation_strategy="epoch",
...     learning_rate=2e-5,
...     weight_decay=0.01,
... )

>>> trainer = Trainer(
...     model=model,
...     args=training_args,
...     train_dataset=lm_dataset["train"],
...     eval_dataset=lm_dataset["test"],
... )

>>> trainer.train()
```

### Fine-tune with TensorFlow

To fine-tune a model in TensorFlow is just as easy, with only a few differences.

<Tip>

If you aren't familiar with fine-tuning a model with Keras, take a look at the basic tutorial [here](training#finetune-with-keras)!

</Tip>

Start by batching the processed examples together with the [`DefaultDataCollator`] function. Make sure you set `return_tensors="tf"` to return `tf.Tensor`'s instead of PyTorch tensors!

```py
>>> from transformers import DefaultDataCollator

>>> data_collator = DefaultDataCollator(return_tensors="tf")
```

Convert your datasets to the `tf.data.Dataset` format with [`to_tf_dataset`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html#datasets.Dataset.to_tf_dataset). Specify inputs and labels in `columns`:

```py
>>> tf_train_set = lm_dataset["train"].to_tf_dataset(
...     columns=["attention_mask", "input_ids", "labels"],
...     dummy_labels=True,
...     shuffle=True,
...     batch_size=16,
...     collate_fn=data_collator,
... )

>>> tf_test_set = lm_dataset["test"].to_tf_dataset(
...     columns=["attention_mask", "input_ids", "labels"],
...     dummy_labels=True,
...     shuffle=False,
...     batch_size=16,
...     collate_fn=data_collator,
... )
```

Set up an optimizer function, learning rate, and some training hyperparameters:

```py
>>> from transformers import create_optimizer, AdamWeightDecay

>>> optimizer = AdamWeightDecay(learning_rate=2e-5, weight_decay_rate=0.01)
```

Load DistilGPT2 with [`TFAutoModelForCausalLM`]:

```py
>>> from transformers import TFAutoModelForCausalLM

>>> model = TFAutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("distilgpt2")
```

Configure the model for training with [`compile`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#compile-method):

```py
>>> import tensorflow as tf

>>> model.compile(optimizer=optimizer)
```

Finally, fine-tune the model by calling [`fit`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#fit-method):

```py
>>> model.fit(x=tf_train_set, validation_data=tf_test_set, epochs=3)
```

## Masked language modeling

<Youtube id="mqElG5QJWUg"/>

Masked language modeling is also known as a fill-mask task because it predicts a masked token in a sequence. These model types require a good contextual understanding of an entire sequence instead of only the left context. This section shows you how to fine-tune [DistilRoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/distilroberta-base) to predict a masked word.

### Fine-tune with Trainer

Load DistilRoBERTa with [`AutoModelForMaskedlM`]:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM

>>> model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("distilroberta-base")
```

Use [`DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`] to batch the examples together. You didn't need to specify this data collator explicitly during causal language modeling because you only used its default parameters. But for masked language modeling, you want to randomly mask the tokens with the `mlm_probability` parameter each time you iterate over the data.

[`DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`] will also pad your text and labels, so they are a uniform length. While it is possible to pad your text and labels in the `tokenizer` function by setting `padding=True`, it is more efficient to only pad the text and labels to the length of the longest element in its batch. This is known as *dynamic padding* and is enabled by [`DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`].

```py
>>> from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling, TrainingArguments, Trainer

>>> data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm_probability=0.15)
```

<Tip>

If you aren't familiar with fine-tuning a model with Trainer, take a look at the basic tutorial [here](training#finetune-with-trainer)!

</Tip>

At this point, only three steps remain:

1. Define your training hyperparameters in [`TrainingArguments`].
2. Pass the training arguments to [`Trainer`] along with the model, datasets, and data collator.
3. Call [`~Trainer.train`] to fine-tune your model.

```py
>>> training_args = TrainingArguments(
...     output_dir="./results",
...     evaluation_strategy="epoch",
...     learning_rate=2e-5,
...     num_train_epochs=3,
...     weight_decay=0.01,
... )

>>> trainer = Trainer(
...     model=model,
...     args=training_args,
...     train_dataset=lm_dataset["train"],
...     eval_dataset=lm_dataset["test"],
...     data_collator=data_collator,
... )

>>> trainer.train()
```

...     batch_size=16,

... )

>>> tf_test_set = lm_dataset["test"].to_tf_dataset(
...     columns=["attention_mask", "input_ids", "labels"],
...     dummy_labels=True,
...     shuffle=False,

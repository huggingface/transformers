# AutoClasses

With so many different Transformer architectures, it can be challenging to create one for your checkpoint. As a part of 🤗 Transformers core philosophy to make the library easy, simple and flexible to use, the `AutoClasses` automatically infers and loads the correct architecture given a checkpoint. The `from_pretrained` method lets you quickly load a pretrained model for any architecture so you don't have to devote time and resources to train a model from scratch. Producing this type of checkpoint-agnostic code means if your code works for one checkpoint, it will work with another checkpoint (as long as it was trained for a similar task) even if the architecture is different.

<Tip>

Remember that the architecture refers to the skeleton of the model, and checkpoints are the weights for a given architecture. For example, [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) is an architecture while `bert-base-uncased` is a checkpoint. Model is a general term that can mean either architecture or checkpoint.

</Tip>

In this tutorial, you will:

* Load a pretrained tokenizer.
* Load a pretrained feature extractor.
* Load a pretrained processor.
* Load a pretrained model.

## `AutoTokenizer`

Nearly every NLP task begins with a tokenizer. A tokenizer converts your input into a format that can be processed by the model.

Load a tokenizer with the [`AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained`] method:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
```

Then you can tokenize your input as shown below:

```py
>>> sequence = "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit."
>>> print(tokenizer(sequence))
{'input_ids': [101, 1999, 1037, 4920, 1999, 1996, 2598, 2045, 2973, 1037, 7570, 10322, 4183, 1012, 102], 
 'token_type_ids': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}
```

## `AutoFeatureExtractor`

For audio and vision tasks, you need a feature extractor to process the audio signal or image to a model's input format.

Load a feature extractor with the [`AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained`] method:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor

>>> feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h")
```

## `AutoProcessor`

Multimodal tasks require a processor that combines two types of preprocessing tools. For example, the [LayoutLMV2](model_doc/layoutlmv2) model requires a feature extractor to handle images and a tokenizer to handle text; the processor combines both of them.

Load a processor with the [`AutoProcessor.from_pretrained`] method:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor

>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("microsoft/layoutlmv2-base-uncased")
```

## `AutoModel`

Finally, the [`AutoModel`] class loads a pretrained model for a given task (see [here](model_doc/auto) for a complete list of available tasks). For example, if you want to load a model for sequence classification you should use [`AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained`]:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

>>> model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification

>>> model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

You can easily reuse the same checkpoint to load an architecture for a different task:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification

>>> model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
===PT-TF-SPLIT===
>>> from transformers import TFAutoModelForTokenClassification

>>> model = TFAutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

# Tokenizers

Tokenizers convert text into an array of numbers known as tensors, which are the inputs to a model. There are several tokenizer types, but they all share the same purpose. Split text into smaller words or subwords (tokens) and convert them into numbers (input ids). A tokenizer also returns an attention mask to indicate which tokens should be attended to.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about the most popular tokenization algorithms in the [Summary of the tokenizers](./tokenizer_summary).

To load a tokenizer, call the [`~PreTrainedTokenizer.from_pretrained`] method to load the tokenizer and its configuration from the Hugging Face [Hub](https://hf.co) into the tokenizer class. Apply the tokenizer to a string of text to return the input ids and attention mask.

```py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2-2b")
tokenizer("We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library")
{'input_ids': [2, 1734, 708, 1508, 4915, 577, 1500, 692, 573, 156808, 128149, 9581], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}
```

This guide provides a brief overview of the tokenizer classes and how to preprocess text with it.

## Base tokenizer classes

All tokenizers inherit from a [`PreTrainedTokenizerBase`] class that provides common methods for all tokenizers like [`~PreTrainedTokenizerBase.from_pretrained`] and [`~PreTrainedTokenizerBase.batch_decode`]. From this base class, there are two main tokenizer classes.

- [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] is a Python implementation.
- [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] is a fast Rust-based implementation from the [Tokenizers](https://hf.co/docs/tokenizers/index) library.

Each model tokenizer inherits from one of these two base tokenizer classes, for example [`LlamaTokenizer`] and [`LlamaTokenizerFast`].

The pretrained tokenizer is saved in a [tokenizer.model](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-2b/blob/main/tokenizer.model) file with all its associated vocabulary files.

To use a pretrained tokenizer, you need to load all the vocabulary files and the tokenizer model with the [`~PreTrainedTokenizerBase.from_pretrained`] method. This method accepts a Hub model repository name or a local directory. For a custom tokenizer, you need to load it's vocabulary file. Both methods are shown in [AutoTokenizer](#autotokenizer) and [Model-specific tokenizer](#model-specific-tokenizer) sections.

Whatever tokenizer you use, make sure the tokenizer vocabulary is the same as a pretrained models tokenizers vocabulary. This is especially important if you're using a custom tokenizer which has a different vocabulary than the one generated by a pretrained models tokenizer.

## AutoTokenizer

<Youtube id="Yffk5aydLzg"/>

The [AutoClass](./model_doc/auto) API is a fast and easy way to load a tokenizer without needing to know whether a Python or Rust-based implementation is available. By default, an AutoTokenizer tries to load a fast tokenizer if it's available for a given model, otherwise, it loads the Python implementation.

Use the [`~PreTrainedTokenizer.from_pretrained`] method to load a tokenizer.

```py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2-2b")
tokenizer("We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.")
{'input_ids': [2, 1734, 708, 1508, 4915, 577, 1500, 692, 573, 156808, 128149, 9581, 235265], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}
```

Load your own tokenizer by passing its vocabulary file to the [`~AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained`] method.

```py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./model_directory/my_vocab_file.txt")
```

## Model-specific tokenizer

Each pretrained model is associated with a pretrained tokenizer, and you can load the tokenizer directly from the model-specific class. Check a model's API documentation to check whether a fast tokenizer is supported for a model.

<hfoptions id="tokenizer">
<hfoption id="GemmaTokenizer">

```py
from transformers import GemmaTokenizer

tokenizer = GemmaTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2-2b")
tokenizer("We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.")
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="GemmaTokenizerFast">

```py
from transformers import GemmaTokenizerFast

tokenizer = GemmaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2-2b")
tokenizer("We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.")
```

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

Load your own tokenizer by passing its vocabulary file to the `vocab_file` parameter.

```py
from transformers import GemmaTokenizerFast

tokenizer = GemmaTokenizerFast(vocab_file="my_vocab_file.txt")
```

## Fast tokenizers

[`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] or *fast tokenizers* are Rust-based tokenizers from the [Tokenizers](https://hf.co/docs/tokenizers) library. It is significantly faster at batched tokenization and provides additional alignment methods compared to the Python-based tokenizers.

If you're using the [AutoTokenizer](#autotokenizer) API, it automatically loads a fast tokenizer if it's supported for a given model. Otherwise, you need to explicitly load the fast tokenizer.

This section will show you how to train a fast tokenizer and reuse it in Transformers.

### Train

To train a Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer, create an instance of a [`~tokenizers.Tokenizer`] and [`~tokenizers.trainers.BpeTrainer`] and define the unknown token and special tokens.

```py
from tokenizers import Tokenizer
from tokenizers.models import BPE
from tokenizers.trainers import BpeTrainer

tokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE(unk_token="[UNK]"))
trainer = BpeTrainer(special_tokens=["[UNK]", "[CLS]", "[SEP]", "[PAD]", "[MASK]"])
```

Split the tokens on [`~tokenizers.pre_tokenizers.Whitespace`] to create tokens that don't overlap with each other.

```py
from tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import Whitespace

tokenizer.pre_tokenizer = Whitespace()
```

Pass the text files and trainer to the tokenizer and call [`~tokenizers.Tokenizer.train`] to train the tokenizer.

```py
files = [...]
tokenizer.train(files, trainer)
```

Use the [`~tokenizers.Tokenizer.save`] method to save the tokenizers configuration and vocabulary to a JSON file.

```py
tokenizer.save("tokenizer.json")
```

### Load

To load and use the tokenizer object in Transformers, pass it to the `tokenizer_object` parameter in [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`].

```py
from transformers import PreTrainedTokenizerFast

fast_tokenizer = PreTrainedTokenizerFast(tokenizer_object=tokenizer)
```

To load a saved tokenizer from its JSON file, pass the file path to the `tokenizer_file` parameter in [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`].

```py
from transformers import PreTrainedTokenizerFast

fast_tokenizer = PreTrainedTokenizerFast(tokenizer_file="tokenizer.json")
```

## Preprocess

A tokenizers job is to preprocess text into an array of numbers. When passing a string of text to a tokenizer, there are actually two steps the tokenizer performs to convert the text into input ids.

<!-- insert diagram here -->

```py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/gemma-2-2b")
```

<hfoptions id="steps">
<hfoption id="1. tokenize">

In the first step, a string of text is split into tokens. How the text is split depends on the tokenization algorithm. Call the [`~PreTrainedTokenizer.tokenize`] method to tokenize the text.

```py
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize("We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library")
print(tokens)
['We', '▁are', '▁very', '▁happy', '▁to', '▁show', '▁you', '▁the', '▁🤗', '▁Transformers', '▁library']
```

Gemma uses a [SentencePiece](./tokenizer_summary#sentencepiece) tokenizer which replaces spaces with an underscore `_`.

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="2. convert tokens to ids"

In the second step, the tokens are converted into ids with the [`~PreTrainedTokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids`] method.

```py
ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)
print(ids)
[1734, 708, 1508, 4915, 577, 1500, 692, 573, 156808, 128149, 9581]
```

These are the same input ids you would see if you had just passed the string of text to the tokenizer.

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="3. decode ids to text">

Lastly, the model prediction typically generates numerical outputs which are converted back to text with the [`~PreTrainedTokenizer.decode`] method.

```py
decoded_string = tokenizer.decode(ids)
print(decoded_string)
'We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library'
```

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

### Special tokens

Special tokens are used by the tokenizer to provide the model with some additional information about the text.

For example, if you compare the tokens obtained from passing text directly to the tokenizer and from the [`~PreTrainedTokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids`] method, you'll notice some additional tokens are added.

```py
model_inputs = tokenizer("We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.")
[2, 1734, 708, 1508, 4915, 577, 1500, 692, 573, 156808, 128149, 9581]
tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)
[1734, 708, 1508, 4915, 577, 1500, 692, 573, 156808, 128149, 9581]
```

When you [`~PreTrainedTokenizer.decode`] the ids, you'll see `<bos>` at the beginning of the string. This is used to indicate the beginning of a sentence to the model.

```py
print(tokenizer.decode(model_inputs["input_ids"]))
print(tokenizer.decode(ids))
'<bos>We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.'
'We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library'
```

Not all models need special tokens, but if they do, a tokenizer automatically adds them.

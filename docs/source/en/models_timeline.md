# Models Timeline

The [Models Timeline](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yonigozlan/Transformers-Timeline) is an interactive chart of how architectures in Transformers have changed over time. You can scroll through models in order, spanning text, vision, audio, video, and multimodal use cases.

Use the filters to narrow models by modality or task. Set custom date ranges to focus on models added during specific periods. Click a model card to see its capabilities, supported tasks, and documentation.

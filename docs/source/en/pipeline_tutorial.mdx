# Pipelines for inference

The [`pipeline`] makes it simple to use any model from the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) for inference on any language, computer vision, speech, and multimodal tasks. Even if you don't have experience with a specific modality or aren't familiar with the underlying code behind the models, you can still use them for inference with the [`pipeline`]! This tutorial will teach you to:

* Use a [`pipeline`] for inference.
* Use a specific tokenizer or model.
* Use a [`pipeline`] for audio, vision, and multimodal tasks.

<Tip>

Take a look at the [`pipeline`] documentation for a complete list of supported tasks and available parameters.

</Tip>

## Pipeline usage

While each task has an associated [`pipeline`], it is simpler to use the general [`pipeline`] abstraction which contains all the task-specific pipelines. The [`pipeline`] automatically loads a default model and a preprocessing class capable of inference for your task.

1. Start by creating a [`pipeline`] and specify an inference task:

```py
>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> generator = pipeline(task="text-generation")
```

2. Pass your input text to the [`pipeline`]:

```py
>>> generator(
...     "Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone"
... )  # doctest: +SKIP
[{'generated_text': 'Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Seven for the Iron-priests at the door to the east, and thirteen for the Lord Kings at the end of the mountain'}]
```

If you have more than one input, pass your input as a list:

```py
>>> generator(
...     [
...         "Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone",
...         "Nine for Mortal Men, doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne",
...     ]
... )  # doctest: +SKIP
```

Any additional parameters for your task can also be included in the [`pipeline`]. The `text-generation` task has a [`~generation_utils.GenerationMixin.generate`] method with several parameters for controlling the output. For example, if you want to generate more than one output, set the `num_return_sequences` parameter:

```py
>>> generator(
...     "Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone",
...     num_return_sequences=2,
... )  # doctest: +SKIP
```

### Choose a model and tokenizer

The [`pipeline`] accepts any model from the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). There are tags on the Hub that allow you to filter for a model you'd like to use for your task. Once you've picked an appropriate model, load it with the corresponding `AutoModelFor` and [`AutoTokenizer`] class. For example, load the [`AutoModelForCausalLM`] class for a causal language modeling task:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilgpt2")
>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("distilgpt2")
```

Create a [`pipeline`] for your task, and specify the model and tokenizer you've loaded:

```py
>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> generator = pipeline(task="text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

Pass your input text to the [`pipeline`] to generate some text:

```py
>>> generator(
...     "Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone"
... )  # doctest: +SKIP
[{'generated_text': 'Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Seven for the Dragon-lords (for them to rule in a world ruled by their rulers, and all who live within the realm'}]
```

## Audio pipeline

The [`pipeline`] also supports audio tasks like audio classification and automatic speech recognition.

For example, let's classify the emotion in this audio clip:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset
>>> import torch

>>> torch.manual_seed(42)  # doctest: +IGNORE_RESULT
>>> ds = load_dataset("hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_demo", "clean", split="validation")
>>> audio_file = ds[0]["audio"]["path"]
```

Find an [audio classification](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=audio-classification) model on the Model Hub for emotion recognition and load it in the [`pipeline`]:

```py
>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> audio_classifier = pipeline(
...     task="audio-classification", model="ehcalabres/wav2vec2-lg-xlsr-en-speech-emotion-recognition"
... )
```

Pass the audio file to the [`pipeline`]:

```py
>>> preds = audio_classifier(audio_file)
>>> preds = [{"score": round(pred["score"], 4), "label": pred["label"]} for pred in preds]
>>> preds
[{'score': 0.1315, 'label': 'calm'}, {'score': 0.1307, 'label': 'neutral'}, {'score': 0.1274, 'label': 'sad'}, {'score': 0.1261, 'label': 'fearful'}, {'score': 0.1242, 'label': 'happy'}]
```

## Vision pipeline

Using a [`pipeline`] for vision tasks is practically identical.

Specify your task and pass your image to the classifier. The image can be a link or a local path to the image. For example, what species of cat is shown below?

![pipeline-cat-chonk](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/pipeline-cat-chonk.jpeg)

```py
>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> vision_classifier = pipeline(task="image-classification")
>>> preds = vision_classifier(
...     images="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/pipeline-cat-chonk.jpeg"
... )
>>> preds = [{"score": round(pred["score"], 4), "label": pred["label"]} for pred in preds]
>>> preds
[{'score': 0.4335, 'label': 'lynx, catamount'}, {'score': 0.0348, 'label': 'cougar, puma, catamount, mountain lion, painter, panther, Felis concolor'}, {'score': 0.0324, 'label': 'snow leopard, ounce, Panthera uncia'}, {'score': 0.0239, 'label': 'Egyptian cat'}, {'score': 0.0229, 'label': 'tiger cat'}]
```

## Multimodal pipeline

The [`pipeline`] supports more than one modality. For example, a visual question answering (VQA) task combines text and image. Feel free to use any image link you like and a question you want to ask about the image. The image can be a URL or a local path to the image.

For example, if you use the same image from the vision pipeline above:

```py
>>> image = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/pipeline-cat-chonk.jpeg"
>>> question = "Where is the cat?"
```

Create a pipeline for `vqa` and pass it the image and question:

```py
>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> vqa = pipeline(task="vqa")
>>> preds = vqa(image=image, question=question)
>>> preds = [{"score": round(pred["score"], 4), "answer": pred["answer"]} for pred in preds]
>>> preds
[{'score': 0.9112, 'answer': 'snow'}, {'score': 0.8796, 'answer': 'in snow'}, {'score': 0.6717, 'answer': 'outside'}, {'score': 0.0291, 'answer': 'on ground'}, {'score': 0.027, 'answer': 'ground'}]
```

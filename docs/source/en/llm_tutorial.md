# Text generation

[[open-in-colab]]

Text generation is one of the most popular applications of large language models (LLMs). A LLM is trained to generate the next word (token) given some initial text (prompt) along with its own generated outputs up to a predefined length or when it reaches an end-of-sequence (`EOS`) token.

In Transformers, the [`~GenerationMixin.generate`] API handles text generation, and it is available for all models with generative capabilities.

This guide will show you the basics of text generation with the [`~GenerationMixin.generate`] API and some common pitfalls to avoid.

## Generate

Before you begin, it's helpful to install [bitsandbytes](https://hf.co/docs/bitsandbytes/index) to quantize really large models to reduce their memory usage.

```bash
!pip install transformers bitsandbytes>0.39.0 -q
```
Bitsandbytes supports multiple backends in addition to CUDA-based GPUs. Refer to the multi-backend installation [guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/main/en/installation#multi-backend) to learn more.

Load a LLM with [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] and add the following two parameters to lessen the memory requirements.

- `device_map="auto` enables Accelerate's [Big Model Inference](./models#big-model-inference) feature for automatically initiating the model skeleton and loading and dispatching the model weights across all available devices, starting with the fastest device (GPU).
- `quantization_config` is a configuration object that defines the quantization settings. This examples uses bitsandbytes as the quantization backend (see the [Quantization](./quantization/overview) section for more available backends) and it loads the model in [4-bits](./quantization/bitsandbytes).

```py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig

# load model and set up quantization configuration
quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1", device_map="auto", quantization_config=quantization_config)
```

Tokenize your input, and set the [`~PreTrainedTokenizer.padding_side`] parameter to `"left"` because a LLM is not trained to continue generation from padding tokens. The tokenizer returns the input ids and attention mask.

> [!TIP]
> Process more than one prompt at a time by passing a list of strings to the tokenizer. Batch the inputs to improve throughput at a small cost to latency and memory.

```py
# tokenize input
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1", padding_side="left")
model_inputs = tokenizer(["A list of colors: red, blue"], return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
```

Pass the inputs to [`~GenerationMixin.generate`] to generate tokens, and then [`~PreTrainedTokenizer.batch_decode`] the generated tokens back to text.

```py
# generate and decode back to text
generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs)
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
"A list of colors: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple, pink,"
```

## Pitfalls

The section below covers some common issues that you may encounter during text generation and how to solve them.

## Wrong output length

[`~GenerationMixin.generate`] returns up to 20 tokens by default unless otherwise specified in a models [`GenerationConfig`]. It is highly recommended to manually set the number of generated tokens with the [`max_new_tokens`] parameter to control the output length. [Decoder-only](https://hf.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/6?fw=pt) models returns the initial prompt along with the generated tokens.

```py
model_inputs = tokenizer(["A sequence of numbers: 1, 2"], return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
```

<hfoptions id="output-length">
<hfoption id="default length">

```py
generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs)
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
'A sequence of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5'
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="max_new_tokens">

```py
generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=50)
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
'A sequence of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,'
```

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

## Wrong decoding strategy

The default decoding strategy in [`~GenerationMixin.generate`] is *greedy search*, which selects the next most likely token, unless otherwise specified in a models [`GenerationConfig`]. While this decoding strategy works well for input-grounded tasks (transcription, translation), it is not optimal for more creative use cases (story writing, chat applications).

For example, enable a [multinomial sampling](./generation_strategies#multinomial-sampling) strategy to generate more diverse outputs. Refer to the [Generation strategy](./generation_strategies) guide for more decoding strategies.

```py
model_inputs = tokenizer(["I am a cat."], return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
```

<hfoptions id="decoding">
<hfoption id="greedy search">

```py
generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs)
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="multinomial sampling">

```py
generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, do_sample=True)
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

## Wrong padding side

Inputs need to be padded if they don't have the same length. But LLMs aren't trained to continue generation from padding tokens, which means the [`~PreTrainedTokenizer.padding_side`] parameter needs to be set to the left of the input.

<hfoptions id="padding">
<hfoption id="right pad">

```py
model_inputs = tokenizer(
    ["1, 2, 3", "A, B, C, D, E"], padding=True, return_tensors="pt"
).to("cuda")
generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs)
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
'1, 2, 33333333333'
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="left pad">

```py
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1", padding_side="left")
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
model_inputs = tokenizer(
    ["1, 2, 3", "A, B, C, D, E"], padding=True, return_tensors="pt"
).to("cuda")
generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs)
tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
'1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,'
```

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

## Wrong prompt format

Some models and tasks expect a certain input prompt format, and if the format is incorrect, the model returns a suboptimal output. You can learn more about prompting in the [prompt engineering](./tasks/prompting) guide.

For example, a chat model expects the input as a [chat template](./chat_templating). Your prompt should include a `role` and `content` to indicate who is participating in the conversation. If you try to pass your prompt as a single string, the model doesn't always return the expected output.

```py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha", device_map="auto", load_in_4bit=True
)
```

<hfoptions id="format">
<hfoption id="no format">

```py
prompt = """How many cats does it take to change a light bulb? Reply as a pirate."""
model_inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
input_length = model_inputs.input_ids.shape[1]
generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=50)
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids[:, input_length:], skip_special_tokens=True)[0])
"Aye, matey! 'Tis a simple task for a cat with a keen eye and nimble paws. First, the cat will climb up the ladder, carefully avoiding the rickety rungs. Then, with"
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="chat template">

```py
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a friendly chatbot who always responds in the style of a pirate",
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "How many cats does it take to change a light bulb?"},
]
model_inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
input_length = model_inputs.shape[1]
generated_ids = model.generate(model_inputs, do_sample=True, max_new_tokens=50)
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids[:, input_length:], skip_special_tokens=True)[0])
"Arr, matey! According to me beliefs, 'twas always one cat to hold the ladder and another to climb up it an’ change the light bulb, but if yer looking to save some catnip, maybe yer can

# Experts backends

All Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) implementations perform the same high-level computation. For each token, a router selects *k* experts. The token hidden state is then projected through the selected experts' parameters and aggregated with routing weights. The difference between experts backends is *how* those expert matrix multiplications execute.

The [`ExpertsInterface`] provides optimized experts backends. It decouples the experts implementation from the model code to simplify experimentation with different functions. Add new backends through the same interface.

| experts backend | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | GPU                                                                                                                 | CPU                                                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"eager"`       | Reference implementation that loops over selected experts and applies projections on their tokens.                                                                                                                           | Reasonable baseline performance without requiring compilation.                                                      | Slower than `grouped_mm` but faster than `batched_mm`.      |
| `"batched_mm"`  | Duplicates selected expert parameters for each token and projects all tokens in a single batched GEMM using [`torch.bmm`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.bmm.html).                                    | Fastest for small inputs, especially with compilation. Uses more memory due to parameter duplication.               | Not recommended (significantly slower than other backends). |
| `"grouped_mm"`  | Orders tokens by selected experts and uses [`torch._grouped_mm`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.grouped_mm.html) to project all tokens in a single grouped GEMM (requires PyTorch 2.9+). | Best for larger inputs and more memory efficient as it avoids duplicating expert parameters. Fast with compilation. | Most efficient backend for all input sizes.                 |

Note: When using `experts_implementation="grouped_mm"` on GPU, the model automatically switches to `"batched_mm"` during the decode stage of generation (after prefill). This is because `batched_mm` is significantly faster on lower token count during autoregressive decoding on GPU. On CPU, `grouped_mm` remains active throughout generation as it is more efficient for all input sizes.

## Set an experts backend

Use the `experts_implementation` argument in [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] to instantiate a model with a specific experts backend.

```py
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B",
    dtype="bfloat16",
    experts_implementation="batched_mm",
)
```

Switch between experts backends at runtime without reloading the model using [`~PreTrainedModel.set_experts_implementation`].

```py
model.set_experts_implementation("eager")
```

## Backbone-specific experts backend

Multimodal models can have multiple sub-configs (for example, different backbones). You can set a different experts backend per sub-config by passing a `dict` to `experts_implementation` at load time.

Keys in the mapping must match sub-config names.

```py
from transformers import AutoModelForImageTextToText

experts_implementation_per_backbone = {
    "text_config": "grouped_mm",
    "vision_config": "eager",
}

model = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-Moe",
    experts_implementation=experts_implementation_per_backbone,
)
```

Set the experts backend globally with an empty key.

```py
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B",
    experts_implementation={"": "batched_mm"},
)
```

## torch.compile

All three backends (`"eager"`, `"batched_mm"`, `"grouped_mm"`) are compatible with `torch.compile` to certain extents. The following table summarizes compatibility:

| Implementation | compilation modes                    | dtypes                           | `fullgraph=True` |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `grouped_mm`   | `None`, `max-autotune-no-cudagraphs` | `bfloat16`                       | Yes              |
| `batched_mm`   | all                                  | `bfloat16`, `float16`, `float32` | Yes              |
| `eager`        | all                                  | `bfloat16`, `float16`, `float32` | No               |

Notes:

- The `grouped_mm` experts backend currently only supports `bfloat16` when compiled with `torch.compile`. Additionally, it is not compatible with CUDA graphs, so you must use `mode=None` or `mode="max-autotune-no-cudagraphs"` when compiling.
- The `eager` experts backend uses a data-dependent operation to find which experts are used in a forward pass. This operation is not compatible with full graph compilation (`fullgraph=True`).

```py
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B",
    dtype="bfloat16",
    experts_implementation="grouped_mm",
).eval().cuda()

# Works for grouped_mm (no CUDA graphs)
model.forward = torch.compile(model.forward, mode="max-autotune-no-cudagraphs")
```

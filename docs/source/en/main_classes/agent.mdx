# Agents & Tools

<Tip warning={true}>

Transformers Agent is an experimental API which is subject to change at any time. Results returned by the agents
can vary as the APIs or underlying models are prone to change.

</Tip>

To learn more about agents and tools make sure to read the [introductory guide](../transformers_agents). This page
contains the API docs for the underlying classes.

## Agents

We provide three types of agents: [`HfAgent`] uses inference endpoints for opensource models, [`LocalAgent`] uses a model of your choice locally and [`OpenAiAgent`] uses OpenAI closed models.

# Generation

Each framework has a generate method for text generation implemented in their respective `GenerationMixin` class:

- PyTorch [`~generation.GenerationMixin.generate`] is implemented in [`~generation.GenerationMixin`].

You can parameterize the generate method with a [`~generation.GenerationConfig`] class instance. Please refer to this class for the complete list of generation parameters, which control the behavior of the generation method.

To learn how to inspect a model's generation configuration, what are the defaults, how to change the parameters ad hoc,
and how to create and save a customized generation configuration, refer to the
[text generation strategies guide](../generation_strategies). The guide also explains how to use related features,
like token streaming.

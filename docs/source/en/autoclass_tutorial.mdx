# Load pretrained instances with an AutoClass

With so many different Transformer architectures, it can be challenging to create one for your checkpoint. As a part of 🤗 Transformers core philosophy to make the library easy, simple and flexible to use, an `AutoClass` automatically infer and load the correct architecture from a given checkpoint. The `from_pretrained` method lets you quickly load a pretrained model for any architecture so you don't have to devote time and resources to train a model from scratch. Producing this type of checkpoint-agnostic code means if your code works for one checkpoint, it will work with another checkpoint - as long as it was trained for a similar task - even if the architecture is different.

<Tip>

Remember, architecture refers to the skeleton of the model and checkpoints are the weights for a given architecture. For example, [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) is an architecture, while `bert-base-uncased` is a checkpoint. Model is a general term that can mean either architecture or checkpoint.

</Tip>

In this tutorial, learn to:

* Load a pretrained tokenizer.
* Load a pretrained feature extractor.
* Load a pretrained processor.
* Load a pretrained model.

## AutoTokenizer

Nearly every NLP task begins with a tokenizer. A tokenizer converts your input into a format that can be processed by the model.

Load a tokenizer with [`AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained`]:

``````

Then tokenize your input as shown below:

```py
>>> sequence = "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit."
```

## AutoFeatureExtractor

For audio and vision tasks, a feature extractor processes the audio signal or image into the correct input format.

Load a feature extractor with [`AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained`]:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor
```

## AutoProcessor

Multimodal tasks require a processor that combines two types of preprocessing tools. For example, the [LayoutLMV2](model_doc/layoutlmv2) model requires a feature extractor to handle images and a tokenizer to handle text; a processor combines both of them.

Load a processor with [`AutoProcessor.from_pretrained`]:

``````

## AutoModel

Finally, the `AutoModelFor` classes let you load a pretrained model for a given task (see [here](model_doc/auto) for a complete list of available tasks). For example, load a model for sequence classification with [`AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained`]:

``````

Easily reuse the same checkpoint to load an architecture for a different task:

``````

Generally, we recommend using the `AutoTokenizer` class and the `AutoModelFor` class to load pretrained instances of models. This will ensure you load the correct architecture every time. In the next [tutorial](preprocessing), learn how to use your newly loaded tokenizer, feature extractor and processor to preprocess a dataset for fine-tuning.

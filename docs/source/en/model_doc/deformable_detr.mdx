# Deformable DETR

## Overview

The Deformable DETR model was proposed in [Deformable DETR: Deformable Transformers for End-to-End Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04159) by Xizhou Zhu, Weijie Su, Lewei Lu, Bin Li, Xiaogang Wang, Jifeng Dai.
Deformable DETR mitigates the slow convergence issues and limited feature spatial resolution of the original [DETR](detr) by leveraging a new deformable attention module which only attends to a small set of key sampling points around a reference.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*DETR has been recently proposed to eliminate the need for many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good performance. However, it suffers from slow convergence and limited feature spatial resolution, due to the limitation of Transformer attention modules in processing image feature maps. To mitigate these issues, we proposed Deformable DETR, whose attention modules only attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. Deformable DETR can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small objects) with 10 times less training epochs. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.*

Tips:

- One can use [`DeformableDetrImageProcessor`] to prepare images (and optional targets) for the model.
- Training Deformable DETR is equivalent to training the original [DETR](detr) model. See the [resources](#resources) section below for demo notebooks.

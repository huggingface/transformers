# Speech Encoder Decoder Models

The [`SpeechEncoderDecoderModel`] can be used to initialize a speech-sequence-to-text-sequence model
with any pretrained speech autoencoding model as the encoder (*e.g.* [Wav2Vec2](wav2vec2), [Hubert](hubert)) and any pretrained autoregressive model as the decoder.

The effectiveness of initializing speech-sequence-to-text-sequence models with pretrained checkpoints for speech
recognition and speech translation has *e.g.* been shown in [Large-Scale Self- and Semi-Supervised Learning for Speech
Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06678) by Changhan Wang, Anne Wu, Juan Pino, Alexei Baevski, Michael Auli,
Alexis Conneau.

An example of how to use a [`SpeechEncoderDecoderModel`] for inference can be seen in
[Speech2Text2](speech_to_text_2).

## Overview

The Recurrent Gemma model was proposed in [RecurrentGemma: Moving Past Transformers for Efficient Open Language Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.07839) by the Griffin, RLHF and Gemma Teams of Google.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We introduce RecurrentGemma, an open language model which uses Google’s novel Griffin architecture. Griffin combines linear recurrences with local attention to achieve excellent performance on language. It has a fixed-sized state, which reduces memory use and enables efficient inference on long sequences. We provide a pre-trained model with 2B non-embedding parameters, and an instruction tuned variant. Both models achieve comparable performance to Gemma-2B despite being trained on fewer tokens.*

Tips:

- The original checkpoints can be converted using the conversion script [`src/transformers/models/recurrent_gemma/convert_recurrent_gemma_weights_to_hf.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/recurrent_gemma/convert_recurrent_gemma_to_hf.py). 

This model was contributed by [Arthur Zucker](https://huggingface.co/ArthurZ). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-deepmind/recurrentgemma).

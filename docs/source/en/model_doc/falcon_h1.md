# FalconH1

## Overview

The FalconH1 model was developed by the TII Pretraining team. A comprehensive research paper covering the architecture, pretraining dynamics, experimental results, and conclusions is forthcoming. You can read more about this series in [this website](https://github.com/tiiuae/Falcon-H1).

## FalconH1ForCausalLM

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("tiiuae/Falcon-H1-7B-Instruct")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("tiiuae/Falcon-H1-7B-Instruct")

message = ["Mamba is a snake with following properties  "]
inputs = tokenizer(message, return_tensors='pt', return_token_type_ids=False)
response = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=64)
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(response, skip_special_tokens=True)[0])

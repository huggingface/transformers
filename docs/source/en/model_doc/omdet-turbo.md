## Overview

The OmDet-Turbo model was proposed in [Real-time Transformer-based Open-Vocabulary Detection with Efficient Fusion Head](https://huggingface.co/papers/2403.06892) by Tiancheng Zhao, Peng Liu, Xuan He, Lu Zhang, Kyusong Lee. OmDet-Turbo incorporates components from RT-DETR and introduces a swift multimodal fusion module to achieve real-time open-vocabulary object detection capabilities while maintaining high accuracy. The base model achieves performance of up to 100.2 FPS and 53.4 AP on COCO zero-shot.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*End-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have shown exceptional performance in both closed-set and open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) tasks through the integration of language modalities. However, their demanding computational requirements have hindered their practical application in real-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the limitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and Grounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based real-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module designed to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO. Notably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with TensorRT and language cache techniques applied. Notably, in zero-shot scenarios on COCO and LVIS datasets, OmDet-Turbo achieves performance levels nearly on par with current state-of-the-art supervised models. Furthermore, it establishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks on ODinW and OVDEval, boasting an AP of 30.1 and an NMS-AP of 26.86, respectively. The practicality of OmDet-Turbo in industrial applications is underscored by its exceptional performance on benchmark datasets and superior inference speed, positioning it as a compelling choice for real-time object detection tasks.*

## Usage tips

One unique property of OmDet-Turbo compared to other zero-shot object detection models, such as [Grounding DINO](grounding-dino), is the decoupled classes and prompt embedding structure that allows caching of text embeddings. This means that the model needs both classes and task as inputs, where classes is a list of objects we want to detect and task is the grounded text used to guide open-vocabulary detection. This approach limits the scope of the open-vocabulary detection and makes the decoding process faster.

[`OmDetTurboProcessor`] is used to prepare the classes, task and image triplet. The task input is optional, and when not provided, it will default to `"Detect [class1], [class2], [class3], ..."`. To process the results from the model, one can use `post_process_grounded_object_detection` from [`OmDetTurboProcessor`]. Notably, this function takes in the input classes, as unlike other zero-shot object detection models, the decoupling of classes and task embeddings means that no decoding of the predicted class embeddings is needed in the post-processing step, and the predicted classes can be matched to the inputted ones directly.

## Usage example

### Single image inference

Here's how to load the model and prepare the inputs to perform zero-shot object detection on a single image:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> import requests
>>> from PIL import Image

>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, OmDetTurboForObjectDetection

>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("omlab/omdet-turbo-swin-tiny-hf")
>>> model = OmDetTurboForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("omlab/omdet-turbo-swin-tiny-hf")

>>> url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
>>> image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)
>>> text_labels = ["cat", "remote"]
>>> inputs = processor(image, text=text_labels, return_tensors="pt")

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> # convert outputs (bounding boxes and class logits)
>>> results = processor.post_process_grounded_object_detection(
...     outputs,
...     target_sizes=[(image.height, image.width)],
...     text_labels=text_labels,
...     threshold=0.3,
...     nms_threshold=0.3,
... )
>>> result = results[0]
>>> boxes, scores, text_labels = result["boxes"], result["scores"], result["text_labels"]
>>> for box, score, text_label in zip(boxes, scores, text_labels):
...     box = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]
...     print(f"Detected {text_label} with confidence {round(score.item(), 3)} at location {box}")
Detected remote with confidence 0.768 at location [39.89, 70.35, 176.74, 118.04]
Detected cat with confidence 0.72 at location [11.6, 54.19, 314.8, 473.95]
Detected remote with confidence 0.563 at location [333.38, 75.77, 370.7, 187.03]
Detected cat with confidence 0.552 at location [345.15, 23.95, 639.75, 371.67]
```

### Multi image inference

OmDet-Turbo can perform batched multi-image inference, with support for different text prompts and classes in the same batch:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> import requests
>>> from io import BytesIO
>>> from PIL import Image
>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, OmDetTurboForObjectDetection

>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("omlab/omdet-turbo-swin-tiny-hf")
>>> model = OmDetTurboForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("omlab/omdet-turbo-swin-tiny-hf")

>>> url1 = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
>>> image1 = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(url1).content)).convert("RGB")
>>> text_labels1 = ["cat", "remote"]
>>> task1 = "Detect {}.".format(", ".join(text_labels1))

>>> url2 = "http://images.cocodataset.org/train2017/000000257813.jpg"
>>> image2 = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(url2).content)).convert("RGB")
>>> text_labels2 = ["boat"]
>>> task2 = "Detect everything that looks like a boat."

>>> url3 = "https://cdn.britannica.com/61/93061-050-99147DCE/Statue-of-Liberty-Island-New-York-Bay.jpg"
>>> image3 = Image.open(BytesIO(requests.get(url3).content)).convert("RGB")
>>> text_labels3 = ["statue", "trees"]
>>> task3 = "Focus on the foreground, detect statue and trees."

>>> inputs = processor(
...     images=[image1, image2, image3],
...     text=[text_labels1, text_labels2, text_labels3],
...     task=[task1, task2, task3],
...     return_tensors="pt",
... )

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> # convert outputs (bounding boxes and class logits)
>>> results = processor.post_process_grounded_object_detection(
...     outputs,
...     text_labels=[text_labels1, text_labels2, text_labels3],
...     target_sizes=[(image.height, image.width) for image in [image1, image2, image3]],
...     threshold=0.2,
...     nms_threshold=0.3,
... )

>>> for i, result in enumerate(results):
...     for score, text_label, box in zip(
...         result["scores"], result["text_labels"], result["boxes"]
...     ):
...         box = [round(i, 1) for i in box.tolist()]
...         print(
...             f"Detected {text_label} with confidence "
...             f"{round(score.item(), 2)} at location {box} in image {i}"

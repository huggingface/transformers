## Updated tokenizer behavior 

**DISCLAIMER:** The default behaviour for the tokenizer was fixed and thus changed in April 2023.
The previous version adds `[self.eos_token_id, self.cur_lang_code]` at the end of the token sequence for both target and source tokenization. This is wrong as the NLLB paper mentions (page 48, 6.1.1. Model Architecture) :

*Note that we prefix the source sequence with the source language, as opposed to the target
language as previously done in several works (Arivazhagan et al., 2019; Johnson et al.,
2017). This is primarily because we prioritize optimizing zero-shot performance of our
model on any pair of 200 languages at a minor cost to supervised performance.*

Previous behaviour:

```python
>>> from transformers import NllbTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = NllbTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M")
>>> tokenizer("How was your day?").input_ids
[13374, 1398, 4260, 4039, 248130, 2, 256047]

>>> # 2: '</s>'
>>> # 256047 : 'eng_Latn'
```
New behaviour

```python
>>> from transformers import NllbTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = NllbTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M")
>>> tokenizer("How was your day?").input_ids
[256047, 13374, 1398, 4260, 4039, 248130, 2]
 ```

Enabling the old behaviour can be done as follows:
```python
>>> from transformers import NllbTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = NllbTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M", legacy_behaviour=True)
```

## Overview

The NLLB model was presented in [No Language Left Behind: Scaling Human-Centered Machine Translation](https://huggingface.co/papers/2207.04672) by Marta R. Costa-jussà, James Cross, Onur Çelebi,

The abstract of the paper is the following:

*Driven by the goal of eradicating language barriers on a global scale, machine translation has solidified itself as a key focus of artificial intelligence research today.
However, such efforts have coalesced around a small subset of languages, leaving behind the vast majority of mostly low-resource languages. What does it take to break the
200 language barrier while ensuring safe, high quality results, all while keeping ethical considerations in mind? In No Language Left Behind, we took on this challenge by
first contextualizing the need for low-resource language translation support through exploratory interviews with native speakers. Then, we created datasets and models aimed
at narrowing the performance gap between low and high-resource languages. More specifically, we developed a conditional compute model based on Sparsely Gated Mixture of
Experts that is trained on data obtained with novel and effective data mining techniques tailored for low-resource languages. We propose multiple architectural and training
improvements to counteract overfitting while training on thousands of tasks. Critically, we evaluated the performance of over 40,000 different translation directions using
a human-translated benchmark, Flores-200, and combined human evaluation with a novel toxicity benchmark covering all languages in Flores-200 to assess translation safety.
Our model achieves an improvement of 44% BLEU relative to the previous state-of-the-art, laying important groundwork towards realizing a universal translation system.*

This implementation contains the dense models available on release.

**The sparse model NLLB-MoE (Mixture of Expert) is now available! More details [here](nllb-moe)**

This model was contributed by [Lysandre](https://huggingface.co/lysandre). The authors' code can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/nllb).

## Generating with NLLB

While generating the target text set the `forced_bos_token_id` to the target language id. The following
example shows how to translate English to French using the *facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M* model.

Note that we're using the BCP-47 code for French `fra_Latn`. See [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores/blob/main/flores200/README.md#languages-in-flores-200)
for the list of all BCP-47 in the Flores 200 dataset.

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M")
>>> model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M")

>>> article = "UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria"
>>> inputs = tokenizer(article, return_tensors="pt")

>>> translated_tokens = model.generate(
...     **inputs, forced_bos_token_id=tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids("fra_Latn"), max_length=30
... )
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(translated_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
Le chef de l'ONU dit qu'il n'y a pas de solution militaire en Syrie
```

### Generating from any other language than English

English (`eng_Latn`) is set as the default language from which to translate. In order to specify that you'd like to translate from a different language,
you should specify the BCP-47 code in the `src_lang` keyword argument of the tokenizer initialization.

See example below for a translation from romanian to german:

```py
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
...     "facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M", token=True, src_lang="ron_Latn"
... )
>>> model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M", token=True)

>>> article = "Şeful ONU spune că nu există o soluţie militară în Siria"
>>> inputs = tokenizer(article, return_tensors="pt")

>>> translated_tokens = model.generate(
...     **inputs, forced_bos_token_id=tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids("deu_Latn"), max_length=30
... )
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(translated_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
UN-Chef sagt, es gibt keine militärische Lösung in Syrien
```

## Using Flash Attention 2

Flash Attention 2 is a faster, optimized version of the attention scores computation which relies on `cuda` kernels.

### Installation 

First, check whether your hardware is compatible with Flash Attention 2. The latest list of compatible hardware can be found in the [official documentation](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention#installation-and-features).

Next, [install](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention#installation-and-features) the latest version of Flash Attention 2:

```bash
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### Usage

To load a model using Flash Attention 2, we can pass the argument `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"` to [`.from_pretrained`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained). You can use either `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16` precision.

```python
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

>>> model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M", torch_dtype=torch.float16, attn_implementation="flash_attention_2").to("cuda").eval()
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M")

>>> article = "Şeful ONU spune că nu există o soluţie militară în Siria"
>>> inputs = tokenizer(article, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

>>> translated_tokens = model.generate(
...     **inputs, forced_bos_token_id=tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids("deu_Latn"), max_length=30
... )
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(translated_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
"UN-Chef sagt, es gibt keine militärische Lösung in Syrien"
```

### Expected speedups

Below is an expected speedup diagram that compares pure inference time between the native implementation and the Flash Attention 2.

## Using Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA)
PyTorch includes a native scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) operator as part of `torch.nn.functional`. This function
encompasses several implementations that can be applied depending on the inputs and the hardware in use. See the
[official documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html)
or the [GPU Inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/perf_infer_gpu_one#pytorch-scaled-dot-product-attention)
page for more information.

SDPA is used by default for `torch>=2.1.1` when an implementation is available, but you may also set
`attn_implementation="sdpa"` in `from_pretrained()` to explicitly request SDPA to be used.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M", torch_dtype=torch.float16, attn_implementation="sdpa")
...
```

For the best speedups, we recommend loading the model in half-precision (e.g. `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16`).

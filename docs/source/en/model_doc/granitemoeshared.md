# GraniteMoeShared

## Overview


The GraniteMoe model was proposed in [Power Scheduler: A Batch Size and Token Number Agnostic Learning Rate Scheduler](https://huggingface.co/papers/2408.13359) by Yikang Shen, Matthew Stallone, Mayank Mishra, Gaoyuan Zhang, Shawn Tan, Aditya Prasad, Adriana Meza Soria, David D. Cox and Rameswar Panda.

Additionally this class GraniteMoeSharedModel adds shared experts for Moe.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_path = "ibm-research/moe-7b-1b-active-shared-experts"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)

# drop device_map if running on CPU
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, device_map="auto")
model.eval()

# change input text as desired
prompt = "Write a code to find the maximum value in a list of numbers."

# tokenize the text
input_tokens = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
# generate output tokens
output = model.generate(**input_tokens, max_new_tokens=100)
# decode output tokens into text
output = tokenizer.batch_decode(output)
# loop over the batch to print, in this example the batch size is 1
for i in output:
    print(i)
```

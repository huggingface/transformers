# Wav2Vec2-With-LM

[Wav2Vec2-With-LM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05171) is a speech model that combines Wav2Vec2 with a language model to improve transcription accuracy. What makes it unique is its ability to leverage both acoustic and linguistic information through a two-stage decoding process: first using Wav2Vec2 for acoustic modeling, then applying a language model to refine the transcription. This approach helps correct common speech recognition errors and produces more natural transcriptions.

You can find all the original Wav2Vec2-With-LM checkpoints under the [Wav2Vec2-With-LM](https://huggingface.co/models?other=wav2vec2-with-lm) collection.

> [!TIP]
> Click on the Wav2Vec2-With-LM models in the right sidebar for more examples of how to apply Wav2Vec2-With-LM to different speech tasks like automatic speech recognition (ASR) with improved accuracy.

The example below demonstrates how to use Wav2Vec2-With-LM for automatic speech recognition with [`Pipeline`] or the [`AutoModel`] class.

<hfoptions id="usage">
<hfoption id="Pipeline">

```python
>>> from transformers import pipeline

>>> transcriber = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition", model="facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h-with-lm")
>>> transcriber("path/to/audio.wav")
{'text': 'MISTER QUILTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL'}
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="AutoModel">

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForCTC, Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM
>>> import torch
>>> from datasets import load_dataset

>>> processor = Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h-with-lm")
>>> model = AutoModelForCTC.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h-with-lm")

>>> # Load example audio
>>> dataset = load_dataset("hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy", "clean", split="validation")
>>> audio = dataset[0]["audio"]["array"]

>>> # Process audio
>>> inputs = processor(audio, sampling_rate=16000, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)

>>> # Get logits
>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     logits = model(**inputs).logits

>>> # Decode with LM
>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(logits.numpy()).text
>>> transcription[0]
'MISTER QUILTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL'
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="transformers-cli">

```bash
transformers-cli transcribe facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h-with-lm path/to/audio.wav
```

</hfoption>

Quantization reduces the memory burden of large models by representing the weights in a lower precision. Refer to the [Quantization](../quantization/overview) overview for more available quantization backends.

The example below uses [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes) to quantize the weights to 8-bit integers:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCTC, Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM
>>> import torch

>>> # Load model in 8-bit
>>> model = AutoModelForCTC.from_pretrained(
...     "facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-with-lm",
...     load_in_8bit=True,
...     device_map="auto"
... )
>>> processor = Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-with-lm")

>>> # Process audio and generate transcription
>>> inputs = processor(audio, sampling_rate=16000, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     logits = model(**inputs).logits
>>> transcription = processor.batch_decode(logits.numpy()).text
```

Use the [AttentionMaskVisualizer](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/beb9b5b02246b9b7ee81ddf938f93f44cfeaad19/src/transformers/utils/attention_visualizer.py#L139) to better understand what tokens the model can and cannot attend to:

```python
>>> from transformers.utils.attention_visualizer import AttentionMaskVisualizer

>>> visualizer = AttentionMaskVisualizer("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h-with-lm")
>>> visualizer("path/to/audio.wav")
```

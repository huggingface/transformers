# SuperPoint

[SuperPoint](https://huggingface.co/papers/1712.07629) is the result of self-supervised training of a fully-convolutional network for interest point detection and description. The model is able to detect interest points that are repeatable under homographic transformations and provide a descriptor for each point. Usage on it's own is limited, but it can be used as a feature extractor for other tasks such as homography estimation and image matching.

You can find all the original SuperPoint checkpoints under the [Magic Leap Community](https://huggingface.co/magic-leap-community) organization.

The example below demonstrates how to detect interest points in an image with the [`AutoModel`] class.
<hfoptions id="usage">
<hfoption id="AutoModel">

```py
from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, SuperPointForKeypointDetection
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests

url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("magic-leap-community/superpoint")
model = SuperPointForKeypointDetection.from_pretrained("magic-leap-community/superpoint")

inputs = processor(image, return_tensors="pt")
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Post-process to get keypoints, scores, and descriptors
image_size = (image.height, image.width)
processed_outputs = processor.post_process_keypoint_detection(outputs, [image_size])
```

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

## Notes

- SuperPoint outputs a dynamic number of keypoints per image, which makes it suitable for tasks requiring variable-length feature representations.

    ```py
    from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, SuperPointForKeypointDetection
    import torch
    from PIL import Image
    import requests
    processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("magic-leap-community/superpoint")
    model = SuperPointForKeypointDetection.from_pretrained("magic-leap-community/superpoint")
    url_image_1 = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
    image_1 = Image.open(requests.get(url_image_1, stream=True).raw)
    url_image_2 = "http://images.cocodataset.org/test-stuff2017/000000000568.jpg"
    image_2 = Image.open(requests.get(url_image_2, stream=True).raw)
    images = [image_1, image_2]
    inputs = processor(images, return_tensors="pt")
    # Example of handling dynamic keypoint output
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    keypoints = outputs.keypoints  # Shape varies per image
    scores = outputs.scores        # Confidence scores for each keypoint
    descriptors = outputs.descriptors  # 256-dimensional descriptors
    mask = outputs.mask # Value of 1 corresponds to a keypoint detection
    ```

- The model provides both keypoint coordinates and their corresponding descriptors (256-dimensional vectors) in a single forward pass.
- For batch processing with multiple images, you need to use the mask attribute to retrieve the respective information for each image. You can use the `post_process_keypoint_detection` from the `SuperPointImageProcessor` to retrieve the each image information.

    ```py
    # Batch processing example
    images = [image1, image2, image3]
    inputs = processor(images, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    image_sizes = [(img.height, img.width) for img in images]
    processed_outputs = processor.post_process_keypoint_detection(outputs, image_sizes)
    ```

- You can then print the keypoints on the image of your choice to visualize the result:
    ```py
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.imshow(image_1)
    plt.scatter(
        outputs[0]["keypoints"][:, 0],
        outputs[0]["keypoints"][:, 1],
        c=outputs[0]["scores"] * 100,
        s=outputs[0]["scores"] * 50,
        alpha=0.8
    )
    plt.savefig(f"output_image.png")
    ```

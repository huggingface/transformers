## Overview

The DAB-DETR model was proposed in [DAB-DETR: Dynamic Anchor Boxes are Better Queries for DETR](https://huggingface.co/papers/2201.12329) by Shilong Liu, Feng Li, Hao Zhang, Xiao Yang, Xianbiao Qi, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Lei Zhang.
DAB-DETR is an enhanced variant of Conditional DETR. It utilizes dynamically updated anchor boxes to provide both a reference query point (x, y) and a reference anchor size (w, h), improving cross-attention computation. This new approach achieves 45.7% AP when trained for 50 epochs with a single ResNet-50 model as the backbone.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We present in this paper a novel query formulation using dynamic anchor boxes
for DETR (DEtection TRansformer) and offer a deeper understanding of the role
of queries in DETR. This new formulation directly uses box coordinates as queries
in Transformer decoders and dynamically updates them layer-by-layer. Using box
coordinates not only helps using explicit positional priors to improve the query-to-feature similarity and eliminate the slow training convergence issue in DETR,
but also allows us to modulate the positional attention map using the box width
and height information. Such a design makes it clear that queries in DETR can be
implemented as performing soft ROI pooling layer-by-layer in a cascade manner.
As a result, it leads to the best performance on MS-COCO benchmark among
the DETR-like detection models under the same setting, e.g., AP 45.7% using
ResNet50-DC5 as backbone trained in 50 epochs. We also conducted extensive
experiments to confirm our analysis and verify the effectiveness of our methods.*

This model was contributed by [davidhajdu](https://huggingface.co/davidhajdu).
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DAB-DETR).

## How to Get Started with the Model

Use the code below to get started with the model.

```python
import torch
import requests

from PIL import Image
from transformers import AutoModelForObjectDetection, AutoImageProcessor

url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg' 
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("IDEA-Research/dab-detr-resnet-50")
model = AutoModelForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("IDEA-Research/dab-detr-resnet-50")

inputs = image_processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

results = image_processor.post_process_object_detection(outputs, target_sizes=torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]]), threshold=0.3)

for result in results:
    for score, label_id, box in zip(result["scores"], result["labels"], result["boxes"]):
        score, label = score.item(), label_id.item()
        box = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]
        print(f"{model.config.id2label[label]}: {score:.2f} {box}")
```
This should output
```
cat: 0.87 [14.7, 49.39, 320.52, 469.28]
remote: 0.86 [41.08, 72.37, 173.39, 117.2]
cat: 0.86 [344.45, 19.43, 639.85, 367.86]
remote: 0.61 [334.27, 75.93, 367.92, 188.81]
couch: 0.59 [-0.04, 1.34, 639.9, 477.09]
```

There are three other ways to instantiate a DAB-DETR model (depending on what you prefer):

Option 1: Instantiate DAB-DETR with pre-trained weights for entire model
```py
>>> from transformers import DabDetrForObjectDetection

>>> model = DabDetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("IDEA-Research/dab-detr-resnet-50")
```

Option 2: Instantiate DAB-DETR with randomly initialized weights for Transformer, but pre-trained weights for backbone
```py
>>> from transformers import DabDetrConfig, DabDetrForObjectDetection

>>> config = DabDetrConfig()
>>> model = DabDetrForObjectDetection(config)
```
Option 3: Instantiate DAB-DETR with randomly initialized weights for backbone + Transformer
```py
>>> config = DabDetrConfig(use_pretrained_backbone=False)
>>> model = DabDetrForObjectDetection(config)
```

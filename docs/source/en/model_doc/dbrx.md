# DBRX

[DBRX](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm) is an open, general-purpose large language model introduced by Databricks that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open LLMs, surpassing GPT-3.5 and competing with Gemini 1.0 Pro. It uses a fine-grained mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, making inference up to 2x faster than LLaMA2-70B and about 4x more compute-efficient than Databricksâ€™ previous MPT models. DBRX excels at programming tasks, outperforming specialized models like CodeLLaMA-70B, and is strong in language understanding and math benchmarks. Both base and instruction-tuned versions are openly released on Hugging Face, with availability via APIs and integration into Databricks products

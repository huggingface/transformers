# LightOnOCR

LightOnOCR is a multimodal model designed for optical character recognition (OCR) tasks. It combines a vision encoder for processing document images with a text decoder for generating text sequences.

The model architecture consists of:
- **Vision Encoder**: Processes document images into visual embeddings
- **Text Decoder**: Generates text sequences from the visual embeddings

You can use LightOnOCR for various document understanding tasks including text extraction, document question answering, and structured information extraction.

# EfficientLoFTR

[EfficientLoFTR](https://huggingface.co/papers/2403.04765) is an efficient detector-free local feature matching method that produces semi-dense matches across images with sparse-like speed. It builds upon the original [LoFTR](https://huggingface.co/papers/2104.00680) architecture but introduces significant improvements for both efficiency and accuracy. The key innovation is an aggregated attention mechanism with adaptive token selection that makes the model ~2.5× faster than LoFTR while achieving higher accuracy. EfficientLoFTR can even surpass state-of-the-art efficient sparse matching pipelines like [SuperPoint](./superpoint) + [LightGlue](./lightglue) in terms of speed, making it suitable for large-scale or latency-sensitive applications such as image retrieval and 3D reconstruction.

The example below demonstrates how to match keypoints between two images with [`Pipeline`] or the [`AutoModel`] class.

<hfoption id="Pipeline">

```py
from transformers import pipeline

keypoint_matcher = pipeline(task="keypoint-matching", model="zju-community/efficientloftr")

url_0 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magicleap/SuperGluePretrainedNetwork/refs/heads/master/assets/phototourism_sample_images/united_states_capitol_98169888_3347710852.jpg"

results = keypoint_matcher([url_0, url_1], threshold=0.9)
print(results[0])
# {'keypoint_image_0': {'x': ..., 'y': ...}, 'keypoint_image_1': {'x': ..., 'y': ...}, 'score': ...}
```

<hfoption id="AutoModel">

```py

import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests

url_image1 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magicleap/SuperGluePretrainedNetwork/refs/heads/master/assets/phototourism_sample_images/united_states_capitol_98169888_3347710852.jpg"
image1 = Image.open(requests.get(url_image1, stream=True).raw)
url_image2 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magicleap/SuperGluePretrainedNetwork/refs/heads/master/assets/phototourism_sample_images/united_states_capitol_26757027_6717084061.jpg"
image2 = Image.open(requests.get(url_image2, stream=True).raw)

images = [image1, image2]

processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("zju-community/efficientloftr")
model = AutoModelForKeypointMatching.from_pretrained("zju-community/efficientloftr")

inputs = processor(images, return_tensors="pt")
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Post-process to get keypoints and matches
image_sizes = [[(image.height, image.width) for image in images]]
processed_outputs = processor.post_process_keypoint_matching(outputs, image_sizes, threshold=0.2)
```

## Notes

- EfficientLoFTR is designed for efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. It uses an aggregated attention mechanism with adaptive token selection to reduce computational overhead compared to the original LoFTR.

    ```py
    from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, AutoModelForKeypointMatching
    import torch
    from PIL import Image
    import requests
    
    processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("zju-community/efficientloftr")
    model = AutoModelForKeypointMatching.from_pretrained("zju-community/efficientloftr")
    
    # EfficientLoFTR requires pairs of images
    images = [image1, image2]
    inputs = processor(images, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    
    # Extract matching information
    keypoints = outputs.keypoints        # Keypoints in both images
    matches = outputs.matches            # Matching indices 
    matching_scores = outputs.matching_scores  # Confidence scores
    ```

- The model produces semi-dense matches, offering a good balance between the density of matches and computational efficiency. It excels in handling large viewpoint changes and texture-poor scenarios.

- For better visualization and analysis, use the [`~EfficientLoFTRImageProcessor.post_process_keypoint_matching`] method to get matches in a more readable format.

    ```py
    # Process outputs for visualization
    image_sizes = [[(image.height, image.width) for image in images]]
    processed_outputs = processor.post_process_keypoint_matching(outputs, image_sizes, threshold=0.2)
    
    for i, output in enumerate(processed_outputs):
        print(f"For the image pair {i}")
        for keypoint0, keypoint1, matching_score in zip(
                output["keypoints0"], output["keypoints1"], output["matching_scores"]
        ):
            print(f"Keypoint at {keypoint0.numpy()} matches with keypoint at {keypoint1.numpy()} with score {matching_score}")
    ```

- Visualize the matches between the images using the built-in plotting functionality.

    ```py
    # Easy visualization using the built-in plotting method
    visualized_images = processor.visualize_keypoint_matching(images, processed_outputs)
    ```

- EfficientLoFTR uses a novel two-stage correlation layer that achieves accurate subpixel correspondences, improving upon the original LoFTR's fine correlation module.

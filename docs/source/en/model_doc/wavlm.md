# WavLM

[WavLM](https://huggingface.co/papers/2110.13900) is a self-supervised speech representation model from Microsoft designed to work across the “full stack” of speech tasks, from automatic speech recognition (ASR) to speaker diarization and audio event detection. It builds on HuBERT’s masked prediction approach but introduces denoising and data augmentation to make the learned representations more robust in noisy and multi-speaker conditions.

You can find all the original WavLM checkpoints under the [WavLM](https://huggingface.co/models?other=wavlm) collection.

The example below demonstrates how to extract audio features with [`Pipeline`] or the [`AutoModel`] class.

<hfoptions id="usage">
<hfoption id="Pipeline">

```python
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline(
    task="feature-extraction",
    model="microsoft/wavlm-base",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device=0
)

features = pipe("https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/1.flac")
print(features)
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="AutoModel">

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModel

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("microsoft/wavlm-base")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    "microsoft/wavlm-base",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto"
)

audio_url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/1.flac"
inputs = processor(audio_url, return_tensors="pt")
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
print(outputs.last_hidden_state)
```

Quantization reduces the memory burden of large models by representing the weights in a lower precision. 
Refer to the [Quantization](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/quantization/overview) overview for more available quantization backends.

The example below uses [bitsandbytes](../quantization/bitsandbytes) to quantize the weights to 4-bits.

```python
from transformers import WavLMForCTC, BitsAndBytesConfig

bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_8bit=True,
    llm_int8_threshold=6.0
)

model = WavLMForCTC.from_pretrained(
    "microsoft/wavlm-large",
    quantization_config=bnb_config,
    device_map="auto"
)
```

## Notes
- WavLM processes raw 16kHz audio waveforms provided as 1D float arrays. Use `Wav2Vec2Processor` for preprocessing.
- For CTC-based fine-tuning, model outputs should be decoded with `Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer`.
- The model works particularly well for tasks like speaker verification, identification, and diarization.

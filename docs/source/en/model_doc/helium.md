## Overview

Helium was proposed in [Announcing Helium-1 Preview](https://kyutai.org/2025/01/13/helium.html) by the Kyutai Team.


Helium-1 preview is a lightweight language model with 2B parameters, targeting edge and mobile devices.
It supports the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish.

- **Developed by:** Kyutai
- **Model type:** Large Language Model
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish
- **License:** CC-BY 4.0




## Evaluation

## Usage tips

`Helium` can be found on the [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?other=helium)

In the following, we demonstrate how to use `helium-1-preview` for the inference. 

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
>>> device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("kyutai/helium-1-preview-2b", device_map="auto")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("kyutai/helium-1-preview-2b")

>>> prompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."

>>> model_inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)

>>> generated_ids = model.generate(model_inputs.input_ids, max_new_tokens=512, do_sample=True)

>>> generated_ids = [output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)]

>>> response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```

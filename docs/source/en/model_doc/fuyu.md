# Fuyu

[Fuyu](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b) is a small, open-source multimodal model designed for AI agents that can handle both text and images. Unlike most multimodal models, it uses a decoder-only Transformer without a separate image encoder, projecting image patches directly into the transformer and supporting arbitrary image resolutions. This simplified architecture allows fast inference—under 100 milliseconds for large images—and streamlines training by removing multiple specialized stages. Despite its small size, Fuyu-8B achieves competitive performance on standard image understanding benchmarks like VQAv2, OKVQA, COCO Captions, and AI2D, outperforming larger models on several metrics while being easier to scale and deploy.

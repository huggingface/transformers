## Overview

The [RetriBERT](https://huggingface.co/yjernite/retribert-base-uncased/tree/main) model was proposed in the blog post [Explain Anything Like I'm Five: A Model for Open Domain Long Form
Question Answering](https://yjernite.github.io/lfqa.html). RetriBERT is a small model that uses either a single or
pair of BERT encoders with lower-dimension projection for dense semantic indexing of text.

This model was contributed by [yjernite](https://huggingface.co/yjernite). Code to train and use the model can be
found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/research-projects/distillation).

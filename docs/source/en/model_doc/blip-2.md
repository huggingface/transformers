## Overview

The BLIP-2 model was proposed in [BLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2301.12597) by
Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Silvio Savarese, Steven Hoi. BLIP-2 leverages frozen pre-trained image encoders and large language models (LLMs) by training a lightweight, 12-layer Transformer
encoder in between them, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks. Most notably, BLIP-2 improves upon [Flamingo](https://huggingface.co/papers/2204.14198), an 80 billion parameter model, by 8.7%
on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. 

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*The cost of vision-and-language pre-training has become increasingly prohibitive due to end-to-end training of large-scale models. This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.*

## Usage tips

- BLIP-2 can be used for conditional text generation given an image and an optional text prompt. At inference time, it's recommended to use the [`generate`] method.
- One can use [`Blip2Processor`] to prepare images for the model, and decode the predicted tokens ID's back to text.

> [!NOTE]
> BLIP models after release v4.46 will raise warnings about adding `processor.num_query_tokens = {{num_query_tokens}}` and expand model embeddings layer to add special `<image>` token. It is strongly recommended to add the attributes to the processor if you own the model checkpoint, or open a PR if it is not owned by you. Adding these attributes means that BLIP will add the number of query tokens required per image and expand the text with as many `<image>` placeholders as there will be query tokens. Usually it is around 500 tokens per image, so make sure that the text is not truncated as otherwise there wil be failure when merging the embeddings.
The attributes can be obtained from model config, as `model.config.num_query_tokens` and model embeddings expansion can be done by following [this link](https://gist.github.com/zucchini-nlp/e9f20b054fa322f84ac9311d9ab67042).

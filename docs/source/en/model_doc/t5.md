# T5

[T5](https://huggingface.co/papers/1910.10683) explores transfer learning in NLP by converting all language problems into a text-to-text format. This unified framework systematically compares various pretraining objectives, architectures, and datasets across numerous language understanding tasks. Leveraging scale and a new dataset called the "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus," T5 achieves top results on benchmarks such as summarization, question answering, and text classification. The model and associated dataset are publicly available for further research.

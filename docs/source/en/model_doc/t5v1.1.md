# T5v1.1

[T5v1.1](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/main/released_checkpoints.md#t511) builds on the T5 architecture with several key modifications. It replaces the standard ReLU activation in the feed-forward layers with GEGLU, which can improve learning efficiency. Dropout was disabled during pre-training on the C4 dataset, enhancing model quality, though it should be used during fine-tuning. The model does not share parameters between the embedding and classifier layers, and pre-training was done exclusively on C4 without mixing in downstream tasks.

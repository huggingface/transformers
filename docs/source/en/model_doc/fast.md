# FAST

## Overview

Fast model proposes an accurate and efficient scene text detection framework, termed FAST (i.e., faster 
arbitrarily-shaped text detector). 

FAST has two new designs. (1) We design a minimalist kernel representation (only has 1-channel output) to model text 
with arbitrary shape, as well as a GPU-parallel post-processing to efficiently assemble text lines with a negligible 
time overhead. (2) We search the network architecture tailored for text detection, leading to more powerful features 
than most networks that are searched for image classification.

# FAST

## Overview

Fast model proposes an accurate and efficient scene text detection framework, termed FAST (i.e., faster 
arbitrarily-shaped text detector). 

FAST has two new designs. (1) We design a minimalist kernel representation (only has 1-channel output) to model text 
with arbitrary shape, as well as a GPU-parallel post-processing to efficiently assemble text lines with a negligible 
time overhead. (2) We search the network architecture tailored for text detection, leading to more powerful features 
than most networks that are searched for image classification.

## Usage tips 
```py
>>> import torch
>>> import requests

>>> from PIL import Image
>>> from transformers import FastForSceneTextRecognition, FastImageProcessor

>>> image_url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/Raghavan/fast_model_samples/resolve/main/img657.jpg"
>>> image = Image.open(requests.get(image_url, stream=True).raw).convert("RGB")

>>> image_processor = FastImageProcessor.from_pretrained("jadechoghari/FAST-tiny-model")
>>> model = FastForSceneTextRecognition.from_pretrained("jadechoghari/FAST-tiny-model")

>>> inputs = image_processor(image, return_tensor="pt")

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     output = model(**inputs)

>>> target_sizes = [(image.height, image.width)]
>>> output = image_processor.post_process_text_detection(
...     output,
...     target_sizes=target_sizes,
...     threshold=0.88,
...     output_type="boxes",  # or "polygons"
... )
```

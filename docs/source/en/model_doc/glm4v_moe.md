## Overview

Vision-language models (VLMs) have become a key cornerstone of intelligent systems. As real-world AI tasks grow increasingly complex, VLMs urgently need to enhance reasoning capabilities beyond basic multimodal perception — improving accuracy, comprehensiveness, and intelligence — to enable complex problem solving, long-context understanding, and multimodal agents.

Through our open-source work, we aim to explore the technological frontier together with the community while empowering more developers to create exciting and innovative applications.

[GLM-4.5V](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-V) is based on ZhipuAI’s next-generation flagship text foundation model GLM-4.5-Air (106B parameters, 12B active).  It continues the technical approach of [GLM-4.1V-Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01006), achieving SOTA performance among models of the same scale on 42 public vision-language benchmarks.  It covers common tasks such as image, video, and document understanding, as well as GUI agent operations.

Beyond benchmark performance, GLM-4.5V focuses on real-world usability. Through efficient hybrid training, it can handle diverse types of visual content, enabling full-spectrum vision reasoning, including:
- **Image reasoning** (scene understanding, complex multi-image analysis, spatial recognition)
- **Video understanding** (long video segmentation and event recognition)
- **GUI tasks** (screen reading, icon recognition, desktop operation assistance)
- **Complex chart & long document parsing** (research report analysis, information extraction)
- **Grounding** (precise visual element localization)

The model also introduces a **Thinking Mode** switch, allowing users to balance between quick responses and deep reasoning. This switch works the same as in the `GLM-4.5` language model.

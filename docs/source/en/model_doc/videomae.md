# VideoMAE

## Overview

[VideoMAE](https://huggingface.co/papers/2203.12602) is a self-supervised video representation learning model that extends [Masked Autoencoders(MAE)](vit_mae) to video inputs. It learns by randomly masking a large portion of video patches (typically 90%–95%) and reconstructing the missing parts, making it highly data-efficient. Without using any external data, VideoMAE achieves competitive performance across popular video classification benchmarks. Its simple design, strong results, and ability to work with limited labeled data make it a practical choice for video understanding tasks.

You can find all the original VideoMAE checkpoints under the [MCG-NJU](https://huggingface.co/MCG-NJU/models) organization.

## Using Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA)

PyTorch includes a native scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) operator as part of `torch.nn.functional`. This function 
encompasses several implementations that can be applied depending on the inputs and the hardware in use. See the 
[official documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html) 
or the [GPU Inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/perf_infer_gpu_one#pytorch-scaled-dot-product-attention)
page for more information.

SDPA is used by default for `torch>=2.1.1` when an implementation is available, but you may also set 
`attn_implementation="sdpa"` in `from_pretrained()` to explicitly request SDPA to be used.

```
from transformers import VideoMAEForVideoClassification
model = VideoMAEForVideoClassification.from_pretrained("MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics", attn_implementation="sdpa", dtype=torch.float16)
...
```

For the best speedups, we recommend loading the model in half-precision (e.g. `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16`).

On a local benchmark (A100-40GB, PyTorch 2.3.0, OS Ubuntu 22.04) with `float32` and `MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics` model, we saw the following speedups during inference.

|   Batch size |   Average inference time (ms), eager mode |   Average inference time (ms), sdpa model |   Speed up, Sdpa / Eager (x) |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|

|            2 |                                        24 |                                        18 |                      1.33 |
|            4 |                                        43 |                                        32 |                      1.34 |
|            8 |                                        84 |                                        60 |                      1.4  |

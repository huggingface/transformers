# VAN

## Overview

The VAN model was proposed in [Visual Attention Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09741) by Meng-Hao Guo, Cheng-Ze Lu, Zheng-Ning Liu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Shi-Min Hu.

This paper introduces a new attention layer based on convolution operations able to capture both local and distant relationships. This is done by combining normal and large kernel convolution layers. The latter uses a dilated convolution to capture distant correlations.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*While originally designed for natural language processing tasks, the self-attention mechanism has recently taken various computer vision areas by storm. However, the 2D nature of images brings three challenges for applying self-attention in computer vision. (1) Treating images as 1D sequences neglects their 2D structures. (2) The quadratic complexity is too expensive for high-resolution images. (3) It only captures spatial adaptability but ignores channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel large kernel attention (LKA) module to enable self-adaptive and long-range correlations in self-attention while avoiding the above issues. We further introduce a novel neural network based on LKA, namely Visual Attention Network (VAN). While extremely simple, VAN outperforms the state-of-the-art vision transformers and convolutional neural networks with a large margin in extensive experiments, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, etc. Code is available at [this https URL](https://github.com/Visual-Attention-Network/VAN-Classification).*

Tips:

- VAN does not have an embedding layer, thus the `hidden_states` will have a length equal to the number of stages.

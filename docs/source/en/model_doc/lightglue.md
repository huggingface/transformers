# LightGlue

[LightGlue](https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.13643) is a deep neural network that learns to match local features across images. It revisits multiple design decisions of SuperGlue and derives simple but effective improvements. Cumulatively, these improvements make LightGlue more efficient - in terms of both memory and computation, more accurate, and much easier to train. Similar to [SuperGlue](https://huggingface.co/magic-leap-community/superglue_outdoor), this model consists of matching two sets of local features extracted from two images, with the goal of being faster than SuperGlue. Paired with the [SuperPoint model](https://huggingface.co/magic-leap-community/superpoint), it can be used to match two images and estimate the pose between them.

## Usage tips

- LightGlue is adaptive to task difficulty. Inference is much faster on image pairs that are intuitively easy to match, for example, because of larger visual overlap or limited appearance change.
- The model outputs matching indices, keypoints, and confidence scores for each match, similar to SuperGlue but with improved efficiency.
- Use the [`post_process_keypoint_matching`] method to get matches in a more readable format for better visualization and analysis.
- Visualize matches between images using the built-in plotting functionality.

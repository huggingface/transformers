# BigBirdPegasus

[BigBird: Transformers for Longer Sequences](https://huggingface.co/papers/2007.14062) introduces a sparse-attention mechanism that reduces the quadratic dependency on sequence length to linear, enabling handling of much longer sequences compared to models like BERT. BigBird combines sparse, global, and random attention to approximate full attention efficiently. This allows it to process sequences up to 8 times longer on similar hardware, improving performance on long document NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. The model is also a universal approximator of sequence functions and Turing complete, preserving the capabilities of full attention models. Additionally, BigBird explores applications in genomics data.

In the presence of light, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through small pores in their leaves called stomata, and take in water from the soil through their root systems. These ingredients are then transformed into glucose, a type of sugar that serves as a source of chemical energy, and oxygen, which is released as a byproduct into the atmosphere. The glucose produced during photosynthesis is not just used immediately; plants also store it as starch or convert it into other organic compounds like cellulose, which is essential for building their cellular structure.")

## Overview

The [Qwen2-VL](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2-vl/) model is a major update to [Qwen-VL](https://huggingface.co/papers/2308.12966) from the Qwen team at Alibaba Research. 

The abstract from the blog is the following:

*This blog introduces Qwen2-VL, an advanced version of the Qwen-VL model that has undergone significant enhancements over the past year. Key improvements include enhanced image comprehension, advanced video understanding, integrated visual agent functionality, and expanded multilingual support. The model architecture has been optimized for handling arbitrary image resolutions through Naive Dynamic Resolution support and utilizes Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-ROPE) to effectively process both 1D textual and multi-dimensional visual data. This updated model demonstrates competitive performance against leading AI systems like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in vision-related tasks and ranks highly among open-source models in text capabilities. These advancements make Qwen2-VL a versatile tool for various applications requiring robust multimodal processing and reasoning abilities.*

## Usage example

### Single Media inference

The model can accept both images and videos as input. Here's an example code for inference.

```python

import torch
from transformers import Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer, AutoProcessor

# Load the model in half-precision on the available device(s)
model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", device_map="auto")
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct")


conversation = [
    {
        "role":"user",
        "content":[
            {
                "type":"image",
                "url": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-VL/assets/demo.jpeg"
            },
            {
                "type":"text",
                "text":"Describe this image."
            }
        ]
    }
]

inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(
    conversation,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    tokenize=True,
    return_dict=True,
    return_tensors="pt"
).to(model.device)

# Inference: Generation of the output
output_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)
generated_ids = [output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, output_ids)]
output_text = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)
print(output_text)



# Video
conversation = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "video", "path": "/path/to/video.mp4"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "What happened in the video?"},
        ],
    }
]

inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(
    conversation,
    video_fps=1,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    tokenize=True,
    return_dict=True,
    return_tensors="pt"
).to(model.device)


# Inference: Generation of the output
output_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)
generated_ids = [output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, output_ids)]
output_text = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)
print(output_text)
```

### Batch Mixed Media Inference

The model can batch inputs composed of mixed samples of various types such as images, videos, and text. Here is an example.

```python

# Conversation for the first image
conversation1 = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image", "path": "/path/to/image1.jpg"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."}
        ]
    }
]

# Conversation with two images
conversation2 = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image", "path": "/path/to/image2.jpg"},
            {"type": "image", "path": "/path/to/image3.jpg"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "What is written in the pictures?"}
        ]
    }
]

# Conversation with pure text
conversation3 = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "who are you?"
    }
]


# Conversation with mixed midia
conversation4 = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image", "path": "/path/to/image3.jpg"},
            {"type": "image", "path": "/path/to/image4.jpg"},
            {"type": "video", "path": "/path/to/video.jpg"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "What are the common elements in these medias?"},
        ],
    }
]

conversations = [conversation1, conversation2, conversation3, conversation4]
# Preparation for batch inference
ipnuts = processor.apply_chat_template(
    conversations,
    video_fps=1,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    tokenize=True,
    return_dict=True,
    return_tensors="pt"
).to(model.device)


# Batch Inference
output_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)
generated_ids = [output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, output_ids)]
output_text = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)
print(output_text)
```

### Usage Tips

#### Image Resolution trade-off

The model supports a wide range of resolution inputs. By default, it uses the native resolution for input, but higher resolutions can enhance performance at the cost of more computation. Users can set the minimum and maximum number of pixels to achieve an optimal configuration for their needs.

```python
min_pixels = 224*224
max_pixels = 2048*2048
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels)
```

In case of limited GPU RAM, one can reduce the resolution as follows:

```python
min_pixels = 256*28*28
max_pixels = 1024*28*28 
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels)
```
This ensures each image gets encoded using a number between 256-1024 tokens. The 28 comes from the fact that the model uses a patch size of 14 and a temporal patch size of 2 (14 x 2 = 28).


#### Multiple Image Inputs

By default, images and video content are directly included in the conversation. When handling multiple images, it's helpful to add labels to the images and videos for better reference. Users can control this behavior with the following settings:

```python
conversation = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image"}, 
            {"type": "text", "text": "Hello, how are you?"}
        ]
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How can I assist you today?"
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Can you describe these images and video?"}, 
            {"type": "image"}, 
            {"type": "image"}, 
            {"type": "video"}, 
            {"type": "text", "text": "These are from my vacation."}
        ]
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'd be happy to describe the images and video for you. Could you please provide more context about your vacation?"
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "It was a trip to the mountains. Can you see the details in the images and video?"
    }
]

# default:
prompt_without_id = processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, add_generation_prompt=True)
# Excepted output: '<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n<|vision_start|><|image_pad|><|vision_end|>Hello, how are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI'm doing well, thank you for asking.

# add ids
prompt_with_id = processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, add_generation_prompt=True, add_vision_id=True)
# Excepted output: '<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPicture 1: <|vision_start|><|image_pad|><|vision_end|>Hello, how are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI'm doing well, thank you for asking.

#### Flash-Attention 2 to speed up generation

First, make sure to install the latest version of Flash Attention 2:

```bash
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Also, you should have a hardware that is compatible with Flash-Attention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of the [flash attention repository](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). FlashAttention-2 can only be used when a model is loaded in `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16`.

To load and run a model using Flash Attention-2, simply add `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"` when loading the model as follows:

```python
from transformers import Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration

model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", 
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, 
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)
```

## Overview

The LLaVa-NeXT-Video model was proposed in [LLaVA-NeXT: A Strong Zero-shot Video Understanding Model
](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-04-30-llava-next-video/) by Yuanhan Zhang, Bo Li, Haotian Liu, Yong Jae Lee, Liangke Gui, Di Fu, Jiashi Feng, Ziwei Liu, Chunyuan Li. LLaVa-NeXT-Video improves upon [LLaVa-NeXT](llava_next) by fine-tuning on a mix if video and image dataset thus increasing the model's performance on videos.

[LLaVA-NeXT](llava_next) surprisingly has strong performance in understanding video content in zero-shot fashion with the AnyRes technique that it uses. The AnyRes technique naturally represents a high-resolution image into multiple images. This technique is naturally generalizable to represent videos because videos can be considered as a set of frames (similar to a set of images in LLaVa-NeXT). The current version of LLaVA-NeXT makes use of AnyRes and trains with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on top of LLaVA-Next on video data to achieves better video understanding capabilities.The model is a current SOTA among open-source models on [VideoMME bench](https://huggingface.co/papers/2405.21075).


The introduction from the blog is the following:

On January 30, 2024, we released LLaVA-NeXT, an open-source Large Multimodal Model (LMM) that has been trained exclusively on text-image data. With the proposed AnyRes technique, it boosts capabilities in reasoning, OCR, and world knowledge, demonstrating remarkable performance across a spectrum of image-based multimodal understanding tasks, and even exceeding Gemini-Pro on several image benchmarks, e.g. MMMU and MathVista.

**In today’s exploration, we delve into the performance of LLaVA-NeXT within the realm of video understanding tasks. We reveal that LLaVA-NeXT surprisingly has strong performance in understanding video content. The current version of LLaVA-NeXT for videos has several improvements:

- Zero-shot video representation capabilities with AnyRes: The AnyRes technique naturally represents a high-resolution image into multiple images that a pre-trained VIT is able to digest, and forms them into a concatenated sequence. This technique is naturally generalizable to represent videos (consisting of multiple frames), allowing the image-only-trained LLaVA-Next model to perform surprisingly well on video tasks. Notably, this is the first time that LMMs show strong zero-shot modality transfer ability.
- Inference with length generalization improves on longer videos. The linear scaling technique enables length generalization, allowing LLaVA-NeXT to effectively handle long-video beyond the limitation of the "max_token_length" of the LLM.
- Strong video understanding ability. (1) LLaVA-Next-Image, which combines the above two techniques, yields superior zero-shot performance than open-source LMMs tuned on videos. (2) LLaVA-Next-Video, further supervised fine-tuning (SFT) LLaVA-Next-Image on video data, achieves better video understanding capabilities compared to LLaVA-Next-Image. (3) LLaVA-Next-Video-DPO, which aligns the model response with AI feedback using direct preference optimization (DPO), showing significant performance boost.
- Efficient deployment and inference with SGLang. It allows 5x faster inference on video tasks, allowing more scalable serving such as million-level video re-captioning. See instructions in our repo.**


This model was contributed by [RaushanTurganbay](https://huggingface.co/RaushanTurganbay).
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT/tree/inference).

## Usage tips

- We advise users to use `padding_side="left"` when computing batched generation as it leads to more accurate results. Simply make sure to call `processor.tokenizer.padding_side = "left"` before generating.

<Tip warning={true}>

- Llava-Next uses different number of patches for images and thus has to pad the inputs inside modeling code, aside from the padding done when processing the inputs. The default setting is "left-padding" if model is in `eval()` mode, otherwise "right-padding".

</Tip>


> [!NOTE]
> LLaVA models after release v4.46 will raise warnings about adding `processor.patch_size = {{patch_size}}`, `processor.num_additional_image_tokens = {{num_additional_image_tokens}}` and processor.vision_feature_select_strategy = {{vision_feature_select_strategy}}`. It is strongly recommended to add the attributes to the processor if you own the model checkpoint, or open a PR if it is not owned by you.
Adding these attributes means that LLaVA will try to infer the number of image tokens required per image and expand the text with as many `<image>` placeholders as there will be tokens. Usually it is around 500 tokens per image, so make sure that the text is not truncated as otherwise there will be failure when merging the embeddings.
The attributes can be obtained from model config, as `model.config.vision_config.patch_size` or `model.config.vision_feature_select_strategy`. The `num_additional_image_tokens` should be `1` if the vision backbone adds a CLS token or `0` if nothing extra is added to the vision patches.


### Formatting Prompts with Chat Templates  

Each **checkpoint** is trained with a specific prompt format, depending on the underlying large language model backbone. To ensure correct formatting, use the processor’s `apply_chat_template` method.  

**Important:**  
- You must construct a conversation history — passing a plain string won't work.  
- Each message should be a dictionary with `"role"` and `"content"` keys.  
- The `"content"` should be a list of dictionaries for different modalities like `"text"` and `"image"`.  


Here’s an example of how to structure your input. We will use [LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B-hf](https://huggingface.co/llava-hf/LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B-hf) and a conversation history of videos and images.

```python
from transformers import LlavaNextVideoProcessor

processor = LlavaNextVideoProcessor.from_pretrained("llava-hf/LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B-hf")

conversation = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the human's questions."},
            ],
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What’s shown in this image?"},
            {"type": "image"},
            ],
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "This image shows a red stop sign."},]
    },
    {

        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Why is this video funny?"},
            {"type": "video"},
            ],
    },
]

text_prompt = processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, add_generation_prompt=True)

# Note that the template simply formats your prompt, you still have to tokenize it and obtain pixel values for your visuals
print(text_prompt)
```

🚀 **Bonus:** If you're using `transformers>=4.49.0`, you can also get a vectorized output from `apply_chat_template`. See the **Usage Examples** below for more details on how to use it.



## Usage example

### Single Media Mode

The model can accept both images and videos as input. Here's an example code for inference in half-precision (`torch.float16`):

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
import torch
from transformers import LlavaNextVideoForConditionalGeneration, LlavaNextVideoProcessor

# Load the model in half-precision
model = LlavaNextVideoForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("llava-hf/LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B-hf", torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map="auto")
processor = LlavaNextVideoProcessor.from_pretrained("llava-hf/LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B-hf")

# Load the video as an np.array, sampling uniformly 8 frames (can sample more for longer videos)
video_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="raushan-testing-hf/videos-test", filename="sample_demo_1.mp4", repo_type="dataset")

conversation = [
    {

        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Why is this video funny?"},
            {"type": "video", "path": video_path},
            ],
    },
]

inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, num_frames=8, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=True, return_dict=True, return_tensors="pt")

out = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=60)
processor.batch_decode(out, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)
```


### Mixed Media Mode

The model can also generate from an interleaved image-video inputs. However note, that it was not trained in interleaved image-video setting which might affect the performance. Below is an example usage for mixed media input, add the following lines to the above code snippet: 

```python

# Generate from image and video mixed inputs
conversation = [
    {

        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "How many cats are there in the image?"},
            {"type": "image", "url": "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"},
            ],
    },
    {

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "There are two cats"}],
    },
    {

        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Why is this video funny?"},
            {"type": "video", "path": video_path},
            ],
    },
]
inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, num_frames=8, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=True, return_dict=True, padding=True, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate
generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)

```

## Model optimization

### Quantization using Bitsandbytes for memory efficiency

The model can be loaded in lower bits, significantly reducing memory burden while maintaining the performance of the original model. This allows for efficient deployment on resource-constrained cases. 

First, make sure to install bitsandbytes by running `pip install bitsandbytes` and to have access to a GPU/accelerator that is supported by the library.

<Tip>

bitsandbytes is being refactored to support multiple backends beyond CUDA. Currently, ROCm (AMD GPU) and Intel CPU implementations are mature, with Intel XPU in progress and Apple Silicon support expected by Q4/Q1. For installation instructions and the latest backend updates, visit [this link](https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/main/en/installation#multi-backend).

We value your feedback to help identify bugs before the full release! Check out [these docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/main/en/non_cuda_backends) for more details and feedback links.

</Tip>

Then simply load the quantized model by adding [`BitsAndBytesConfig`](../main_classes/quantization#transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig) as shown below:


```python
from transformers import LlavaNextVideoForConditionalGeneration, LlavaNextVideoProcessor

# specify how to quantize the model
quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16,
)

model = LlavaNextVideoForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("llava-hf/LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B-hf", quantization_config=quantization_config, device_map="auto")
```


### Flash-Attention 2 to speed-up generation

Additionally, we can greatly speed-up model inference by using [Flash Attention](../perf_train_gpu_one#flash-attention-2), which is a faster implementation of the attention mechanism used inside the model.

First, make sure to install the latest version of Flash Attention 2:

```bash
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Also, you should have a hardware that is compatible with Flash-Attention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of the [flash attention repository](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). FlashAttention-2 can only be used when a model is loaded in `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16`.

To load and run a model using Flash Attention-2, simply add `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"` when loading the model as follows:

```python
from transformers import LlavaNextVideoForConditionalGeneration

model = LlavaNextVideoForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "llava-hf/LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B-hf", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16, 
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
).to(0)
```

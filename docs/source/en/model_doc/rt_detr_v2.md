# RtDetrV2

## Overview

The RT-DETRv2 model was proposed in [RT-DETRv2: Improved Baseline with Bag-of-Freebies for Real-Time Detection Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17140) by Wenyu Lv, Yian Zhao, Qinyao Chang, Kui Huang, Guanzhong Wang, Yi Liu.

RT-DETRv2 refines RT-DETR by introducing selective multi-scale feature extraction, a discrete sampling operator for broader deployment compatibility, and improved training strategies like dynamic data augmentation and scale-adaptive hyperparameters. These changes enhance flexibility and practicality while maintaining real-time performance.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*In this report, we present RT-DETRv2, an improved Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR). RT-DETRv2 builds upon the previous state-of-the-art real-time detector, RT-DETR, and opens up a set of bag-of-freebies for flexibility and practicality, as well as optimizing the training strategy to achieve enhanced performance. To improve the flexibility, we suggest setting a distinct number of sampling points for features at different scales in the deformable attention to achieve selective multi-scale feature extraction by the decoder. To enhance practicality, we propose an optional discrete sampling operator to replace the grid_sample operator that is specific to RT-DETR compared to YOLOs. This removes the deployment constraints typically associated with DETRs. For the training strategy, we propose dynamic data augmentation and scale-adaptive hyperparameters customization to improve performance without loss of speed.*

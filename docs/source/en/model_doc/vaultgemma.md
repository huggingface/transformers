# VaultGemma

## Overview

[VaultGemma](https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/vaultgemma_tech_report.pdf) is a text-only decoder model
derived from [Gemma 2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/gemma2), notably it drops the norms after
the Attention and MLP blocks, and uses full attention for all layers instead of alternating between full attention and
local sliding attention. VaultGemma is available as a pretrained model with 1B parameters that uses a 1024 token
sequence length.

VaultGemma was trained from scratch with sequence-level differential privacy (DP). Its training data includes the same
mixture as the [Gemma 2 models](https://huggingface.co/collections/google/gemma-2-release-667d6600fd5220e7b967f315),
consisting of a number of documents of varying lengths. Additionally, it is trained using
[DP stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD)](https://huggingface.co/papers/1607.00133) and provides a
(ε ≤ 2.0, δ ≤ 1.1e-10)-sequence-level DP guarantee, where a sequence consists of 1024 consecutive tokens extracted from
heterogeneous data sources. Specifically, the privacy unit of the guarantee is for the sequences after sampling and
packing of the mixture.

The example below demonstrates how to chat with the model with [`Pipeline`], the [`AutoModel`] class, or from the
command line.

text = "Tell me an unknown interesting biology fact about the brain."

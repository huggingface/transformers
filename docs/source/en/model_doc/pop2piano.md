# Pop2Piano

[Pop2Piano](https://huggingface.co/papers/2211.00895) generates piano covers from pop music audio waveforms without requiring melody and chord extraction. It is an encoder-decoder Transformer model that transforms audio waveforms into latent representations and then autoregressively generates token ids representing time, velocity, note, and special tokens. These tokens are decoded into MIDI files, producing plausible piano covers.

```py
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import Pop2PianoForConditionalGeneration, Pop2PianoProcessor

model = Pop2PianoForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("sweetcocoa/pop2piano", dtype="auto")
processor = Pop2PianoProcessor.from_pretrained("sweetcocoa/pop2piano")

ds = load_dataset("sweetcocoa/pop2piano_ci", split="test")
inputs = processor(
    audio=ds["audio"][0]["array"], sampling_rate=ds["audio"][0]["sampling_rate"], return_tensors="pt"
)
model_output = model.generate(input_features=inputs["input_features"], composer="composer1")
tokenizer_output = processor.batch_decode(
    token_ids=model_output, feature_extractor_output=inputs
)["pretty_midi_objects"][0]
tokenizer_output.write("./Outputs/midi_output.mid")
```

## Usage tips

- Install the ðŸ¤— Transformers library and these third-party modules: `pip install pretty-midi==0.2.9 essentia==2.1b6.dev1034 librosa scipy`. Restart your runtime after installation.
- Pop2Piano uses an Encoder-Decoder architecture similar to T5. It generates MIDI files from audio sequences.
- Different composers in [`Pop2PianoForConditionalGeneration.generate`] produce varied results. Load audio files at 44.1 kHz sampling rate for optimal performance.
- While trained primarily on Korean Pop music, Pop2Piano performs well on Western Pop and Hip Hop songs.

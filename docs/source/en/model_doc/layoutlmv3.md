# LayoutLMv3

## Overview

The LayoutLMv3 model was proposed in [LayoutLMv3: Pre-training for Document AI with Unified Text and Image Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08387) by Yupan Huang, Tengchao Lv, Lei Cui, Yutong Lu, Furu Wei.
LayoutLMv3 simplifies [LayoutLMv2](layoutlmv2) by using patch embeddings (as in [ViT](vit)) instead of leveraging a CNN backbone, and pre-trains the model on 3 objectives: masked language modeling (MLM), masked image modeling (MIM)
and word-patch alignment (WPA).

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Self-supervised pre-training techniques have achieved remarkable progress in Document AI. Most multimodal pre-trained models use a masked language modeling objective to learn bidirectional representations on the text modality, but they differ in pre-training objectives for the image modality. This discrepancy adds difficulty to multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we propose LayoutLMv3 to pre-train multimodal Transformers for Document AI with unified text and image masking. Additionally, LayoutLMv3 is pre-trained with a word-patch alignment objective to learn cross-modal alignment by predicting whether the corresponding image patch of a text word is masked. The simple unified architecture and training objectives make LayoutLMv3 a general-purpose pre-trained model for both text-centric and image-centric Document AI tasks. Experimental results show that LayoutLMv3 achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in text-centric tasks, including form understanding, receipt understanding, and document visual question answering, but also in image-centric tasks such as document image classification and document layout analysis.*

This model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr). The TensorFlow version of this model was added by [chriskoo](https://huggingface.co/chriskoo), [tokec](https://huggingface.co/tokec), and [lre](https://huggingface.co/lre). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/layoutlmv3).

## Usage tips

- In terms of data processing, LayoutLMv3 is identical to its predecessor [LayoutLMv2](layoutlmv2), except that:
    - images need to be resized and normalized with channels in regular RGB format. LayoutLMv2 on the other hand normalizes the images internally and expects the channels in BGR format.
    - text is tokenized using byte-pair encoding (BPE), as opposed to WordPiece.
  Due to these differences in data preprocessing, one can use [`LayoutLMv3Processor`] which internally combines a [`LayoutLMv3ImageProcessor`] (for the image modality) and a [`LayoutLMv3Tokenizer`]/[`LayoutLMv3TokenizerFast`] (for the text modality) to prepare all data for the model.
- Regarding usage of [`LayoutLMv3Processor`], we refer to the [usage guide](layoutlmv2#usage-layoutlmv2processor) of its predecessor.

### Using Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA)

PyTorch includes a native scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) operator as part of [torch.nn.functional](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.functional.html). This function 
encompasses several memory-efficient attention implementations that can be applied depending on the inputs and hardware. See the 
[official documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html) 
or the [GPU Inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/perf_infer_gpu_one#pytorch-scaled-dot-product-attention)
page for more information.

SDPA is used by default for `torch>=2.1.1` when an implementation is available, but you may also set 
`attn_implementation="sdpa"` in `from_pretrained()` to explicitly request SDPA to be used.

For the best speedups, we recommend loading the model in half-precision (e.g. `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16`).

```py
from transformers import LayoutLMv3Model

model = LayoutLMv3Model.from_pretrained("microsoft/layoutlmv3-base", torch_dtype=torch.float16, attn_implementation="sdpa")
...
```

On a local benchmark ((A100-80GB, 16 CPU workers, RAM 128 GB, PyTorch 2.4.1, OS Ubuntu 22.04)) with pre-tokenized dataset with `bfloat16`, we saw the 
following speedups during training.

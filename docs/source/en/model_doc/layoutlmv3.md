# LayoutLMv3

## Overview

The LayoutLMv3 model was proposed in [LayoutLMv3: Pre-training for Document AI with Unified Text and Image Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08387) by Yupan Huang, Tengchao Lv, Lei Cui, Yutong Lu, Furu Wei.
LayoutLMv3 simplifies [LayoutLMv2](layoutlmv2) by using patch embeddings (as in [ViT](vit)) instead of leveraging a CNN backbone, and pre-trains the model on 3 objectives: masked language modeling (MLM), masked image modeling (MIM)
and word-patch alignment (WPA).

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Self-supervised pre-training techniques have achieved remarkable progress in Document AI. Most multimodal pre-trained models use a masked language modeling objective to learn bidirectional representations on the text modality, but they differ in pre-training objectives for the image modality. This discrepancy adds difficulty to multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we propose LayoutLMv3 to pre-train multimodal Transformers for Document AI with unified text and image masking. Additionally, LayoutLMv3 is pre-trained with a word-patch alignment objective to learn cross-modal alignment by predicting whether the corresponding image patch of a text word is masked. The simple unified architecture and training objectives make LayoutLMv3 a general-purpose pre-trained model for both text-centric and image-centric Document AI tasks. Experimental results show that LayoutLMv3 achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in text-centric tasks, including form understanding, receipt understanding, and document visual question answering, but also in image-centric tasks such as document image classification and document layout analysis.*

This model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr). The TensorFlow version of this model was added by [chriskoo](https://huggingface.co/chriskoo), [tokec](https://huggingface.co/tokec), and [lre](https://huggingface.co/lre). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/layoutlmv3).

## Usage tips

- In terms of data processing, LayoutLMv3 is identical to its predecessor [LayoutLMv2](layoutlmv2), except that:
    - images need to be resized and normalized with channels in regular RGB format. LayoutLMv2 on the other hand normalizes the images internally and expects the channels in BGR format.
    - text is tokenized using byte-pair encoding (BPE), as opposed to WordPiece.
  Due to these differences in data preprocessing, one can use [`LayoutLMv3Processor`] which internally combines a [`LayoutLMv3ImageProcessor`] (for the image modality) and a [`LayoutLMv3Tokenizer`]/[`LayoutLMv3TokenizerFast`] (for the text modality) to prepare all data for the model.
- Regarding usage of [`LayoutLMv3Processor`], we refer to the [usage guide](layoutlmv2#usage-layoutlmv2processor) of its predecessor.

## Resources

A list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by 🌎) resources to help you get started with LayoutLMv3. If you're interested in submitting a resource to be included here, please feel free to open a Pull Request and we'll review it! The resource should ideally demonstrate something new instead of duplicating an existing resource.

<Tip>

LayoutLMv3 is nearly identical to LayoutLMv2, so we've also included LayoutLMv2 resources you can adapt for LayoutLMv3 tasks. For these notebooks, take care to use [`LayoutLMv2Processor`] instead when preparing data for the model!

# LLaVa

## Overview

LLaVa is an open-source chatbot trained by fine-tuning LlamA/Vicuna on GPT-generated multimodal instruction-following data. It is an auto-regressive language model, based on the transformer architecture. In other words, it is an multi-modal version of LLMs fine-tuned for chat / instructions.

The LLaVa model was proposed in [Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08485) and improved in [Improved Baselines with Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03744) by Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Yuheng Li and Yong Jae Lee.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Large multimodal models (LMM) have recently shown encouraging progress with visual instruction tuning. In this note, we show that the fully-connected vision-language cross-modal connector in LLaVA is surprisingly powerful and data-efficient. With simple modifications to LLaVA, namely, using CLIP-ViT-L-336px with an MLP projection and adding academic-task-oriented VQA data with simple response formatting prompts, we establish stronger baselines that achieve state-of-the-art across 11 benchmarks. Our final 13B checkpoint uses merely 1.2M publicly available data, and finishes full training in ∼1 day on a single 8-A100 node. We hope this can make state-of-the-art LMM research more accessible. Code and model will be publicly available*

## Usage tips

- We advise users to use `padding_side="left"` when computing batched generation as it leads to more accurate results. Simply make sure to call `processor.tokenizer.padding_side = "left"` before generating.

- Note the model has not been explicitly trained to process multiple images in the same prompt, although this is technically possible, you may experience inaccurate results.

- For better results, we recommend users to prompt the model with the correct prompt format: 

```bash
"USER: <image>\n<prompt> ASSISTANT:"
```

For multiple turns conversation:

```bash
"USER: <image>\n<prompt1> ASSISTANT: <answer1></s>USER: <prompt2> ASSISTANT: <answer2></s>USER: <prompt3> ASSISTANT:"
```

### Using Flash Attention 2

Flash Attention 2 is an even faster, optimized version of the previous optimization, please refer to the [Flash Attention 2 section of performance docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perf_infer_gpu_one).

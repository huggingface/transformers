# Qwen2Audio

## Overview

The Qwen2-Audio is the new model series of large audio-language models from the Qwen team. Qwen2-Audio is capable of accepting various audio signal inputs and performing audio analysis or direct textual responses with regard to speech instructions. We introduce two distinct audio interaction modes:

* voice chat: users can freely engage in voice interactions with Qwen2-Audio without text input
* audio analysis: users could provide audio and text instructions for analysis during the interaction

It was proposed in [Qwen2-Audio Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10759) by Yunfei Chu, Jin Xu, Qian Yang, Haojie Wei, Xipin Wei, Zhifang Guo, Yichong Leng, Yuanjun Lv, Jinzheng He, Junyang Lin, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou. 

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We introduce the latest progress of Qwen-Audio, a large-scale audio-language model called Qwen2-Audio, which is capable of accepting various audio signal inputs and performing audio analysis or direct textual responses with regard to speech instructions. In contrast to complex hierarchical tags, we have simplified the pre-training process by utilizing natural language prompts for different data and tasks, and have further expanded the data volume. We have boosted the instruction-following capability of Qwen2-Audio and implemented two distinct audio interaction modes for voice chat and audio analysis. In the voice chat mode, users can freely engage in voice interactions with Qwen2-Audio without text input. In the audio analysis mode, users could provide audio and text instructions for analysis during the interaction. Note that we do not use any system prompts to switch between voice chat and audio analysis modes. Qwen2-Audio is capable of intelligently comprehending the content within audio and following voice commands to respond appropriately. For instance, in an audio segment that simultaneously contains sounds, multi-speaker conversations, and a voice command, Qwen2-Audio can directly understand the command and provide an interpretation and response to the audio. Additionally, DPO has optimized the model's performance in terms of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. According to the evaluation results from AIR-Bench, Qwen2-Audio outperformed previous SOTAs, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, in tests focused on audio-centric instruction-following capabilities. Qwen2-Audio is open-sourced with the aim of fostering the advancement of the multi-modal language community. *


## Usage tips

`Qwen2-Audio-7B` and `Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct` can be found on the [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/Qwen)

### Inference

```python
from io import BytesIO
from urllib.request import urlopen
import librosa
from transformers import AutoProcessor, Qwen2AudioForConditionalGeneration

model = Qwen2AudioForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B", trust_remote_code=True, device_map="auto")
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B", trust_remote_code=True)

prompt = "<|audio_bos|><|AUDIO|><|audio_eos|>Generate the caption in English:"
url = "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Audio/glass-breaking-151256.mp3"
audio, sr = librosa.load(BytesIO(urlopen(url).read()), sr=processor.feature_extractor.sampling_rate)
inputs = processor(text=prompt, audios=audio, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=256)
generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs.input_ids.size(1):]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]

# We can also omit the audio_bos and audio_eos tokens
prompt = "<|AUDIO|><|audio_eos|>Generate the caption in English:"
```

In the following, we demonstrate how to use `Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct` for the inference, supporting both voice chat and audio analysis modes. Note that we have used the ChatML format for dialog, in this demo we show how to leverage `apply_chat_template` for this purpose.

### Voice Chat Inference
In the voice chat mode, users can freely engage in voice interactions with Qwen2-Audio without text input:
```python
from io import BytesIO
from urllib.request import urlopen
import librosa
from transformers import Qwen2AudioForConditionalGeneration, AutoProcessor

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct")
model = Qwen2AudioForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct", device_map="auto")

conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "audio", "audio_url": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/audio/guess_age_gender.wav"},
    ]},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the speaker is female and in her twenties."},
    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "audio", "audio_url": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/audio/translate_to_chinese.wav"},
    ]},
]
text = processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)
audios = []
for message in conversation:
    if isinstance(message["content"], list):
        for ele in message["content"]:
            if ele["type"] == "audio":
                audios.append(librosa.load(
                    BytesIO(urlopen(ele['audio_url']).read()), 
                    sr=processor.feature_extractor.sampling_rate)[0]
                )

inputs = processor(text=text, audios=audios, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
inputs.input_ids = inputs.input_ids.to("cuda")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=256)
generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs.input_ids.size(1):]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]
```

### Audio Analysis Inference
In the audio analysis, users could provide both audio and text instructions for analysis:
```python
from io import BytesIO
from urllib.request import urlopen
import librosa
from transformers import Qwen2AudioForConditionalGeneration, AutoProcessor

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct")
model = Qwen2AudioForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct", device_map="auto")

conversation = [
    {'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant.'}, 
    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "audio", "audio_url": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/audio/glass-breaking-151256.mp3"},
        {"type": "text", "text": "What's that sound?"},
    ]},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is the sound of glass shattering."},
    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "What can you do when you hear that?"},
    ]},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Stay alert and cautious, and check if anyone is hurt or if there is any damage to property."},
    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "audio", "audio_url": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/audio/1272-128104-0000.flac"},
        {"type": "text", "text": "What does the person say?"},
    ]},
]
text = processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)
audios = []
for message in conversation:
    if isinstance(message["content"], list):
        for ele in message["content"]:
            if ele["type"] == "audio":
                audios.append(
                    librosa.load(
                        BytesIO(urlopen(ele['audio_url']).read()), 
                        sr=processor.feature_extractor.sampling_rate)[0]
                )

inputs = processor(text=text, audios=audios, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
inputs.input_ids = inputs.input_ids.to("cuda")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=256)
generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs.input_ids.size(1):]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]
```

### Batch Inference
We also support batch inference:
```python
from io import BytesIO
from urllib.request import urlopen
import librosa
from transformers import Qwen2AudioForConditionalGeneration, AutoProcessor

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct")
model = Qwen2AudioForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct", device_map="auto")

conversation1 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "audio", "audio_url": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/audio/glass-breaking-151256.mp3"},
        {"type": "text", "text": "What's that sound?"},
    ]},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is the sound of glass shattering."},
    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "audio", "audio_url": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/audio/f2641_0_throatclearing.wav"},
        {"type": "text", "text": "What can you hear?"},
    ]}
]

conversation2 = [
    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "audio", "audio_url": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-Audio/audio/1272-128104-0000.flac"},
        {"type": "text", "text": "What does the person say?"},
    ]},
]

conversations = [conversation1, conversation2]

text = [processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False) for conversation in conversations]

audios = []
for conversation in conversations:
    for message in conversation:
        if isinstance(message["content"], list):
            for ele in message["content"]:
                if ele["type"] == "audio":
                    audios.append(
                        librosa.load(
                            BytesIO(urlopen(ele['audio_url']).read()), 
                            sr=processor.feature_extractor.sampling_rate)[0]
                    )

inputs = processor(text=text, audios=audios, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
inputs['input_ids'] = inputs['input_ids'].to("cuda")
inputs.input_ids = inputs.input_ids.to("cuda")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=256)
generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs.input_ids.size(1):]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)

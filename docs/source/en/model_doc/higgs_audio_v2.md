## Overview

Higgs Audio V2 is a powerful audio foundation model developed by [Boson AI](https://www.boson.ai/). 
The model was pretrained on over 10 million hours of audio data and a diverse set of text data. 
Despite having no post-training or fine-tuning, Higgs Audio v2 excels in expressive audio generation, thanks to its deep language and acoustic understanding.

**Model Architecture:**
<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/eustlb/documentation-images/resolve/main/higgs_audio_v2_architecture_combined.png"/>
</div>
Higgs Audio v2 adopts the "generation variant" depicted in the architecture figure above. Its strong performance is driven by three key technical innovations:

- Developed an automated annotation pipeline that leverages multiple ASR models, sound event classification models, and our in-house audio understanding model. Using this pipeline, we cleaned and annotated 10 million hours audio data, which we refer to as AudioVerse. The in-house understanding model is finetuned on top of Higgs Audio v1 Understanding, which adopts the "understanding variant" shown in the architecture figure.
- Trained a unified audio tokenizer from scratch that captures both semantic and acoustic features.
- Proposed DualFFN architecture, which enhances the LLM’s ability to model acoustics tokens with minimal computational overhead.

### Training

> [!TIP]
> By default, the model does not load the text language modeling head to save memory (~1.5GiB reduction), as it's not required for generation.
> However, when training the model, you need the text head to compute loss on text tokens. To enable it, set `use_text_head=True` when instantiating the model (see example below).

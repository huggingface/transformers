# FLAVA

## Overview

The FLAVA model was proposed in [FLAVA: A Foundational Language And Vision Alignment Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04482) by Amanpreet Singh, Ronghang Hu, Vedanuj Goswami, Guillaume Couairon, Wojciech Galuba, Marcus Rohrbach, and Douwe Kiela and is accepted at CVPR 2022.

The paper aims at creating a single unified foundation model which can work across vision, language 
as well as vision-and-language multimodal tasks.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*State-of-the-art vision and vision-and-language models rely on large-scale visio-linguistic pretraining for obtaining good performance on a variety 
of downstream tasks. Generally, such models are often either cross-modal (contrastive) or multi-modal 
(with earlier fusion) but not both; and they often only target specific modalities or tasks. A promising 
direction would be to use a single holistic universal model, as a "foundation", that targets all modalities 
at once -- a true vision and language foundation model should be good at vision tasks, language tasks, and 
cross- and multi-modal vision and language tasks. We introduce FLAVA as such a model and demonstrate 
impressive performance on a wide range of 35 tasks spanning these target modalities.*

## Overview

The CLIPSeg model was proposed in [Image Segmentation Using Text and Image Prompts](https://huggingface.co/papers/2112.10003) by Timo Lüddecke
and Alexander Ecker. CLIPSeg adds a minimal decoder on top of a frozen [CLIP](clip) model for zero-shot and one-shot image segmentation.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Image segmentation is usually addressed by training a
model for a fixed set of object classes. Incorporating additional classes or more complex queries later is expensive
as it requires re-training the model on a dataset that encompasses these expressions. Here we propose a system
that can generate image segmentations based on arbitrary
prompts at test time. A prompt can be either a text or an
image. This approach enables us to create a unified model
(trained once) for three common segmentation tasks, which
come with distinct challenges: referring expression segmentation, zero-shot segmentation and one-shot segmentation.
We build upon the CLIP model as a backbone which we extend with a transformer-based decoder that enables dense
prediction. After training on an extended version of the
PhraseCut dataset, our system generates a binary segmentation map for an image based on a free-text prompt or on
an additional image expressing the query. We analyze different variants of the latter image-based prompts in detail.
This novel hybrid input allows for dynamic adaptation not
only to the three segmentation tasks mentioned above, but
to any binary segmentation task where a text or image query
can be formulated. Finally, we find our system to adapt well
to generalized queries involving affordances or properties*

## Usage tips

- [`CLIPSegForImageSegmentation`] adds a decoder on top of [`CLIPSegModel`]. The latter is identical to [`CLIPModel`].
- [`CLIPSegForImageSegmentation`] can generate image segmentations based on arbitrary prompts at test time. A prompt can be either a text
(provided to the model as `input_ids`) or an image (provided to the model as `conditional_pixel_values`). One can also provide custom
conditional embeddings (provided to the model as `conditional_embeddings`).

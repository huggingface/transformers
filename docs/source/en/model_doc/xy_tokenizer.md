## Overview

**`XY-Tokenizer`** is a speech codec that simultaneously models both semantic and acoustic aspects of speech, converting audio into discrete tokens and decoding them back to high-quality audio. It achieves efficient speech representation at only 1kbps with RVQ8 quantization at 12.5Hz frame rate.

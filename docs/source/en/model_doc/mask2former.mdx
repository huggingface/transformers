# Mask2Former

## Overview

The Mask2Former model was proposed in [Masked-attention Mask Transformer for Universal Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01527) by Bowen Cheng, Ishan Misra, Alexander G. Schwing, Alexander Kirillov, Rohit Girdhar. Mask2Former is a unified framework for panoptic, instance and semantic segmentation and features significant performance and efficiency improvements over [MaskFormer](maskformer).

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Image segmentation groups pixels with different semantics, e.g., category or instance membership. Each choice
of semantics defines a task. While only the semantics of each task differ, current research focuses on designing specialized architectures for each task. We present Masked-attention Mask Transformer (Mask2Former), a new architecture capable of addressing any image segmentation task (panoptic, instance or semantic). Its key components include masked attention, which extracts localized features by constraining cross-attention within predicted mask regions. In addition to reducing the research effort by at least three times, it outperforms the best specialized architectures by a significant margin on four popular datasets. Most notably, Mask2Former sets a new state-of-the-art for panoptic segmentation (57.8 PQ on COCO), instance segmentation (50.1 AP on COCO) and semantic segmentation (57.7 mIoU on ADE20K).*

A follow up work on Mask2Former for video segmentation was also released in [Mask2Former for Video Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10764) by Bowen Cheng, Anwesa Choudhuri, Ishan Misra, Alexander Kirillov, Rohit Girdhar, Alexander G. Schwing. 

The abstract from the video instance segmentation paper is the following:

*We find Mask2Former also achieves state-of-the-art performance on video instance segmentation without modifying the architecture, the loss or even the training pipeline. In this report, we show universal image segmentation architectures trivially generalize to video segmentation by directly predicting 3D segmentation volumes. Specifically, Mask2Former sets a new state-of-the-art of 60.4 AP on YouTubeVIS-2019 and 52.6 AP on YouTubeVIS-2021. We believe Mask2Former is also capable of handling video semantic and panoptic segmentation, given its versatility in image segmentation. We hope this will make state-of-the-art video segmentation research more accessible and bring more attention to designing universal image and video segmentation architectures.*

Tips:
- Mask2Former uses the same preprocessing and postprocessing steps as [MaskFormer](maskformer). Use [`Mask2FormerImageProcessor`] or [`AutoImageProcessor`] to prepare images and optional targets for the model.
- To get the final segmentation, depending on the task, you can call [`~Mask2FormerImageProcessor.post_process_semantic_segmentation`] or [`~Mask2FormerImageProcessor.post_process_instance_segmentation`] or [`~Mask2FormerImageProcessor.post_process_panoptic_segmentation`]. All three tasks can be solved using [`Mask2FormerForUniversalSegmentation`] output, panoptic segmentation accepts an optional `label_ids_to_fuse` argument to fuse instances of the target object/s (e.g. sky) together.
- To get the final segmentation result for video instance segmentation task, you can call [`~Mask2FormerImageProcessor.post_process_instance_segmentation`].

## Resources

A list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by 🌎) resources to help you get started with Mask2Former.

- Demo notebooks regarding inference + fine-tuning Mask2Former on custom data can be found [here](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/Mask2Former).
- An extensive tutorial to fine-tune Mask2Former's predecessor [MaskFormer](maskformer) for the instance segmentation task can be found [here](https://pyimagesearch.com/2023/03/13/train-a-maskformer-segmentation-model-with-hugging-face-transformers/). The same steps can be used to fine-tune Mask2Former once the image processor and model names are replaced with the corresponding Mask2Former class names.

If you're interested in submitting a resource to be included here, please feel free to open a Pull Request and we will review it.
The resource should ideally demonstrate something new instead of duplicating an existing resource.

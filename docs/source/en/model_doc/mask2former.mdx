# mask2former

## Overview

The Mask2Former model was proposed in [Masked-attention Mask Transformer for Universal Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01527) by Bowen Cheng, Ishan Misra, Alexander G. Schwing, Alexander Kirillov, Rohit Girdhar.
Mask2Former is a single architecture for panoptic, instance and semantic segmentation.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Image segmentation groups pixels with different seman-
tics, e.g., category or instance membership. Each choice
of semantics defines a task. While only the semantics of
each task differ, current research focuses on designing spe-
cialized architectures for each task. We present Masked-
attention Mask Transformer (Mask2Former), a new archi-
tecture capable of addressing any image segmentation task
(panoptic, instance or semantic). Its key components in-
clude masked attention, which extracts localized features by
constraining cross-attention within predicted mask regions.
In addition to reducing the research effort by at least three
times, it outperforms the best specialized architectures by
a significant margin on four popular datasets. Most no-
tably, Mask2Former sets a new state-of-the-art for panoptic
segmentation (57.8 PQ on COCO), instance segmentation
(50.1 AP on COCO) and semantic segmentation (57.7 mIoU
on ADE20K).*

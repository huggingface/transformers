# Jukebox

## Overview

The Jukebox model was proposed in [Jukebox: A generative model for music](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00341.pdf)
by Prafulla Dhariwal, Heewoo Jun, Christine Payne, Jong Wook Kim, Alec Radford,
Ilya Sutskever. It introduces a generative music model which can produce minute long samples that can be conditionned on
an artist, genres and lyrics.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We introduce Jukebox, a model that generates music with singing in the raw audio domain. We tackle the long context of raw audio using a multiscale VQ-VAE to compress it to discrete codes, and modeling those using autoregressive Transformers. We show that the combined model at scale can generate high-fidelity and diverse songs with coherence up to multiple minutes. We can condition on artist and genre to steer the musical and vocal style, and on unaligned lyrics to make the singing more controllable. We are releasing thousands of non cherry-picked samples, along with model weights and code.*

As shown on the following figure, Jukebox is made of 3 `priors` which are decoder only models. They follow the architecture described in [Generating Long Sequences with Sparse Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509), modified to support longer context length. 
First, a autoencoder is used to encode the text lyrics. Next, the first (also called `top_prior`) prior attends to the last hidden states extracted from the lyrics encoder. The priors are linked to the previous priors respectively via an `AudioConditionner` module. The`AudioConditioner` upsamples the outputs of the previous prior to raw tokens at a certain audio frame per second resolution. 
The metadata such as *artist, genre and timing* are passed to each prior, in the form of a start token and positionnal embedding for the timing data.  The hidden states are mapped to the closest codebook vector from the VQVAE in order to convert them to raw audio.

Tips:
- This model is very slow, and takes 8h to generate a minute long audio using the 5b top prior on a V100 GPU.
- Primed sampling requires more memory than ancestral sampling and should be used with `fp16` set to `True`.

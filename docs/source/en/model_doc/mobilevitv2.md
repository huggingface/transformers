## Overview

The MobileViTV2 model was proposed in [Separable Self-attention for Mobile Vision Transformers](https://huggingface.co/papers/2206.02680) by Sachin Mehta and Mohammad Rastegari.

MobileViTV2 is the second version of MobileViT, constructed by replacing the multi-headed self-attention in MobileViT with separable self-attention.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Mobile vision transformers (MobileViT) can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several mobile vision tasks, including classification and detection. Though these models have fewer parameters, they have high latency as compared to convolutional neural network-based models. The main efficiency bottleneck in MobileViT is the multi-headed self-attention (MHA) in transformers, which requires O(k2) time complexity with respect to the number of tokens (or patches) k. Moreover, MHA requires costly operations (e.g., batch-wise matrix multiplication) for computing self-attention, impacting latency on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a separable self-attention method with linear complexity, i.e. O(k). A simple yet effective characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses element-wise operations for computing self-attention, making it a good choice for resource-constrained devices. The improved model, MobileViTV2, is state-of-the-art on several mobile vision tasks, including ImageNet object classification and MS-COCO object detection. With about three million parameters, MobileViTV2 achieves a top-1 accuracy of 75.6% on the ImageNet dataset, outperforming MobileViT by about 1% while running 3.2× faster on a mobile device.*

## Usage tips

- MobileViTV2 is more like a CNN than a Transformer model. It does not work on sequence data but on batches of images. Unlike ViT, there are no embeddings. The backbone model outputs a feature map.
- One can use [`MobileViTImageProcessor`] to prepare images for the model. Note that if you do your own preprocessing, the pretrained checkpoints expect images to be in BGR pixel order (not RGB).
- The available image classification checkpoints are pre-trained on [ImageNet-1k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k) (also referred to as ILSVRC 2012, a collection of 1.3 million images and 1,000 classes).
- The segmentation model uses a [DeepLabV3](https://huggingface.co/papers/1706.05587) head. The available semantic segmentation checkpoints are pre-trained on [PASCAL VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/).

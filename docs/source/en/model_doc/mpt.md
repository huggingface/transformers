## Overview

The MPT model was proposed by the [MosaicML](https://www.mosaicml.com/) team and released with multiple sizes and finetuned variants. The MPT models are a series of open source and commercially usable LLMs pre-trained on 1T tokens. 

MPT models are GPT-style decoder-only transformers with several improvements: performance-optimized layer implementations, architecture changes that provide greater training stability, and the elimination of context length limits by replacing positional embeddings with ALiBi. 

- MPT base: MPT base pre-trained models on next token prediction 
- MPT instruct: MPT base models fine-tuned on instruction based tasks
- MPT storywriter: MPT base models fine-tuned for 2500 steps on 65k-token excerpts of fiction books contained in the books3 corpus, this enables the model to handle very long sequences

The original code is available at the  [`llm-foundry`](https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry/tree/main) repository.

Read more about it [in the release blogpost](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b)

## Usage tips

- Learn more about some techniques behind training of the model [in this section of llm-foundry repository](https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md#faqs)
- If you want to use the advanced version of the model (triton kernels, direct flash attention integration), you can still use the original model implementation by adding `trust_remote_code=True` when calling `from_pretrained`.

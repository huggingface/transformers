# LED

[Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED)](https://huggingface.co/papers/2004.05150) is an encoder-decoder  transformer model for sequence-to-sequence tasks like summarization. It extends [Longformer](.longformer), an encoder-only model designed to handle long inputs, by adding a decoder layer. The decoder uses full self-attention on the encoded tokens and previously decoded locations. Because of Longformer's linear self-attention mechanism, LED is more efficient than standard encoder-decoder models when processing long sequences.

You can find all the original [LED] checkpoints under the [Ai2](https://huggingface.co/allenai/models?search=led) organization.

The example below demonstrates how to summarize text with [`Pipeline`], [`AutoModel`], and from the command line.

Through photosynthesis, plants capture energy from sunlight using a green pigment called chlorophyll, which is located in specialized cell structures called chloroplasts. In the presence of light, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through small pores in their leaves called stomata, and take in water from the soil through their root systems.
These ingredients are then transformed into glucose, a type of sugar that serves as a source of chemical energy, and oxygen, which is released as a byproduct into the atmosphere. The glucose produced during photosynthesis is not just used immediately; plants also store it as starch or convert it into other organic compounds like cellulose, which is essential for building their cellular structure.
This energy reserve allows them to grow, develop leaves, produce flowers, bear fruit, and carry out various physiological processes throughout their lifecycle.""")

Quantization reduces the memory burden of large models by representing the weights in a lower precision. Refer to the [Quantization](../quantization/overview) overview for more available quantization backends.

The example below uses [bitsandbytes](../quantization/bitsandbytes) to only quantize the weights to int4.

```python
import torch
from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4"
)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(
    "allenai/led-large-16384",
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
    quantization_config=quantization_config
)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    "allenai/led-large-16384"
)

## Notes

- [`LEDForConditionalGeneration`] is an extension of [`BartForConditionalGeneration`] exchanging the traditional self-attention layer with Longformer's chunked self-attention layer. [`LEDTokenizer`] is an alias of [`BartTokenizer`].
- LED pads the `input_ids` to be a multiple of `config.attention_window` if required. A small speedup is gained when [`LEDTokenizer`] is used with the `pad_to_multiple_of` argument.
- LED works best on long-range sequence-to-sequence tasks where the `input_ids` are significantly longer than 1024 tokens.
- LED uses global attention by means of the `global_attention_mask` (see [`LongformerModel`]). For summarization, it is advised to put global attention only on the first `<s>` token. For question answering, it is advised to put global attention on all tokens of the question.
- To fine-tune LED on all 16384 parameters, gradient checkpointing can be enabled in case training leads to out-of-memory (OOM) errors. Enable gradient checkpointing by adding `model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()` and setting `use_cache=False` to disable the caching mechanism to save memory.
- Inputs should be padded on the right because LED uses absolute position embeddings.

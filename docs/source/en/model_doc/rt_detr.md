## Overview


The RT-DETR model was proposed in [DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection](https://huggingface.co/papers/2304.08069) by Wenyu Lv, Yian Zhao, Shangliang Xu, Jinman Wei, Guanzhong Wang, Cheng Cui, Yuning Du, Qingqing Dang, Yi Liu.

RT-DETR is an object detection model that stands for "Real-Time DEtection Transformer." This model is designed to perform object detection tasks with a focus on achieving real-time performance while maintaining high accuracy. Leveraging the transformer architecture, which has gained significant popularity in various fields of deep learning, RT-DETR processes images to identify and locate multiple objects within them.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Recently, end-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have achieved remarkable performance. However, the issue of the high computational cost of DETRs has not been effectively addressed, limiting their practical application and preventing them from fully exploiting the benefits of no post-processing, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS). In this paper, we first analyze the influence of NMS in modern real-time object detectors on inference speed, and establish an end-to-end speed benchmark. To avoid the inference delay caused by NMS, we propose a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR), the first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge. Specifically, we design an efficient hybrid encoder to efficiently process multi-scale features by decoupling the intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion, and propose IoU-aware query selection to improve the initialization of object queries. In addition, our proposed detector supports flexibly adjustment of the inference speed by using different decoder layers without the need for retraining, which facilitates the practical application of real-time object detectors. Our RT-DETR-L achieves 53.0% AP on COCO val2017 and 114 FPS on T4 GPU, while RT-DETR-X achieves 54.8% AP and 74 FPS, outperforming all YOLO detectors of the same scale in both speed and accuracy. Furthermore, our RT-DETR-R50 achieves 53.1% AP and 108 FPS, outperforming DINO-Deformable-DETR-R50 by 2.2% AP in accuracy and by about 21 times in FPS.*

## Usage tips

Initially, an image is processed using a pre-trained convolutional neural network, specifically a Resnet-D variant as referenced in the original code. This network extracts features from the final three layers of the architecture. Following this, a hybrid encoder is employed to convert the multi-scale features into a sequential array of image features. Then, a decoder, equipped with auxiliary prediction heads is used to refine the object queries. This process facilitates the direct generation of bounding boxes, eliminating the need for any additional post-processing to acquire the logits and coordinates for the bounding boxes.

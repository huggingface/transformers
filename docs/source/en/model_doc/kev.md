# kev

kev is a pointer decision head introduced by [kev](https://huggingface.co/jaredpalmer/kev-4b): each option is scored by the dot product of the projected hidden states at the end of the option and at the end of the question.

Decision heads are applied by [`DecisionPipeline`] to the hidden states of the original checkpoint. The chat template,
the settings and the head live in their own repo next to it.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

decide = pipeline("decision", model="jaredpalmer/kev-4b", decision_config="ArthurZ/kev-4b")
decide(
    {
        "state": "I was charged twice for my order and want a refund.",
        "questions": {"refund": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Is a refund requested?"}},
    }
)
```

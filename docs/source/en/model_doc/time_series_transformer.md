## Overview

The Time Series Transformer model is a vanilla encoder-decoder Transformer for time series forecasting.
This model was contributed by [kashif](https://huggingface.co/kashif).

## Usage tips

- Similar to other models in the library, [`TimeSeriesTransformerModel`] is the raw Transformer without any head on top, and [`TimeSeriesTransformerForPrediction`]
adds a distribution head on top of the former, which can be used for time-series forecasting. Note that this is a so-called probabilistic forecasting model, not a
point forecasting model. This means that the model learns a distribution, from which one can sample. The model doesn't directly output values.
- [`TimeSeriesTransformerForPrediction`] consists of 2 blocks: an encoder, which takes a `context_length` of time series values as input (called `past_values`),
and a decoder, which predicts a `prediction_length` of time series values into the future (called `future_values`). During training, one needs to provide
pairs of (`past_values` and `future_values`) to the model.
- In addition to the raw (`past_values` and `future_values`), one typically provides additional features to the model. These can be the following:
    - `past_time_features`: temporal features which the model will add to `past_values`. These serve as "positional encodings" for the Transformer encoder.
    Examples are "day of the month", "month of the year", etc. as scalar values (and then stacked together as a vector).
    e.g. if a given time-series value was obtained on the 11th of August, then one could have [11, 8] as time feature vector (11 being "day of the month", 8 being "month of the year").
    - `future_time_features`: temporal features which the model will add to `future_values`. These serve as "positional encodings" for the Transformer decoder.
    Examples are "day of the month", "month of the year", etc. as scalar values (and then stacked together as a vector).
    e.g. if a given time-series value was obtained on the 11th of August, then one could have [11, 8] as time feature vector (11 being "day of the month", 8 being "month of the year").
    - `static_categorical_features`: categorical features which are static over time (i.e., have the same value for all `past_values` and `future_values`).
    An example here is the store ID or region ID that identifies a given time-series.
    Note that these features need to be known for ALL data points (also those in the future).
    - `static_real_features`: real-valued features which are static over time (i.e., have the same value for all `past_values` and `future_values`).
    An example here is the image representation of the product for which you have the time-series values (like the [ResNet](resnet) embedding of a "shoe" picture,
    if your time-series is about the sales of shoes).
    Note that these features need to be known for ALL data points (also those in the future).
- The model is trained using "teacher-forcing", similar to how a Transformer is trained for machine translation. This means that, during training, one shifts the
`future_values` one position to the right as input to the decoder, prepended by the last value of `past_values`. At each time step, the model needs to predict the
next target. So the set-up of training is similar to a GPT model for language, except that there's no notion of `decoder_start_token_id` (we just use the last value
of the context as initial input for the decoder).
- At inference time, we give the final value of the `past_values` as input to the decoder. Next, we can sample from the model to make a prediction at the next time step,
which is then fed to the decoder in order to make the next prediction (also called autoregressive generation).

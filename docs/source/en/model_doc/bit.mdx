# Big Transfer (BiT)

## Overview

The BiT model was proposed in [Big Transfer (BiT): General Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11370) by Alexander Kolesnikov, Lucas Beyer, Xiaohua Zhai, Joan Puigcerver, Jessica Yung, Sylvain Gelly, Neil Houlsby.
BiT is a simple recipe for scaling up pre-training of [ResNet](resnet)-like architectures (specifically, ResNetv2). The method results in significant improvements for transfer learning.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Transfer of pre-trained representations improves sample efficiency and simplifies hyperparameter tuning when training deep neural networks for vision. We revisit the paradigm of pre-training on large supervised datasets and fine-tuning the model on a target task. We scale up pre-training, and propose a simple recipe that we call Big Transfer (BiT). By combining a few carefully selected components, and transferring using a simple heuristic, we achieve strong performance on over 20 datasets. BiT performs well across a surprisingly wide range of data regimes -- from 1 example per class to 1M total examples. BiT achieves 87.5% top-1 accuracy on ILSVRC-2012, 99.4% on CIFAR-10, and 76.3% on the 19 task Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB). On small datasets, BiT attains 76.8% on ILSVRC-2012 with 10 examples per class, and 97.0% on CIFAR-10 with 10 examples per class. We conduct detailed analysis of the main components that lead to high transfer performance.*

Tips:

- BiT models are equivalent to ResNetv2 in terms of architecture, except that: 1) all batch normalization layers are replaced by [group normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494),
2) [weight standardization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10520) is used for convolutional layers. The authors show that the combination of both is useful for training with large batch sizes, and has a significant
impact on transfer learning.

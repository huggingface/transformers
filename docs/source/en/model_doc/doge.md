# Doge


## Overview

Doge is a series of small language models based on the [Doge](https://github.com/LoserCheems/WonderfulMatrices) architecture, aiming to combine the advantages of state-space and self-attention algorithms, calculate dynamic masks from cached value states using the zero-order hold method, and solve the problem of existing mainstream language models getting lost in context. It uses the `wsd_scheduler` scheduler to pre-train on the `smollm-corpus`, and can continue training on new datasets or add sparse activation feedforward networks from stable stage checkpoints.

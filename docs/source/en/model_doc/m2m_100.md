# M2M100

[M2M100](https://huggingface.co/papers/2010.11125) addresses the limitations of existing multilingual machine translation models by focusing on true Many-to-Many translation between 100 languages, not just those involving English. The model is trained on a large, open-sourced dataset covering thousands of language pairs, mined through large-scale techniques. It employs a combination of dense scaling and language-specific sparse parameters to enhance model capacity. This approach results in BLEU score improvements of over 10 for non-English language pairs while maintaining competitive performance with leading WMT systems.

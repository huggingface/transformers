<Tip warning={true}>

This model is in maintenance mode only, we don't accept any new PRs changing its code.
If you run into any issues running this model, please reinstall the last version that supported this model: v4.40.2.
You can do so by running the following command: `pip install -U transformers==4.40.2`.

## Overview

NAT was proposed in [Neighborhood Attention Transformer](https://huggingface.co/papers/2204.07143)
by Ali Hassani, Steven Walton, Jiachen Li, Shen Li, and Humphrey Shi.

It is a hierarchical vision transformer based on Neighborhood Attention, a sliding-window self attention pattern.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision.
NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a
linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's
receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike
Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package
with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less
memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA
that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive;
NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9%
ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size. *

This model was contributed by [Ali Hassani](https://huggingface.co/alihassanijr).
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer).

## Usage tips

- One can use the [`AutoImageProcessor`] API to prepare images for the model.
- NAT can be used as a *backbone*. When `output_hidden_states = True`,
it will output both `hidden_states` and `reshaped_hidden_states`.
The `reshaped_hidden_states` have a shape of `(batch, num_channels, height, width)` rather than
`(batch_size, height, width, num_channels)`.

Notes:
- NAT depends on [NATTEN](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/)'s implementation of Neighborhood Attention.
You can install it with pre-built wheels for Linux by referring to [shi-labs.com/natten](https://shi-labs.com/natten),
or build on your system by running `pip install natten`.
Note that the latter will likely take time to compile. NATTEN does not support Windows devices yet.
- Patch size of 4 is only supported at the moment.

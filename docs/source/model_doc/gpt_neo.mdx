# GPT Neo

## Overview

The GPTNeo model was released in the [EleutherAI/gpt-neo](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neo) repository by Sid
Black, Stella Biderman, Leo Gao, Phil Wang and Connor Leahy. It is a GPT2 like causal language model trained on the
[Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/) dataset.

The architecture is similar to GPT2 except that GPT Neo uses local attention in every other layer with a window size of
256 tokens.

This model was contributed by [valhalla](https://huggingface.co/valhalla).

### Generation

The `generate()` method can be used to generate text using GPT Neo model.

```python
>>> from transformers import GPTNeoForCausalLM, GPT2Tokenizer
>>> model = GPTNeoForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B")
>>> tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B")

>>> prompt = "In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, " \
...          "previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the " \
...          "researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English."

>>> input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids

>>> gen_tokens = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True, temperature=0.9, max_length=100,)
>>> gen_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(gen_tokens)[0]
```

This model is used detecting **hatespeech** in **Arabic language**. The mono in the name refers to the monolingual setting, where the model is trained using only Arabic language data. It is finetuned on multilingual bert model.
The model is trained with different learning rates and the best validation score achieved is 0.877609 for a learning rate of 2e-5. Training code can be found at this [url](https://github.com/punyajoy/DE-LIMIT)

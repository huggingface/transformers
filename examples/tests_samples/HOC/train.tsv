11724768_s0	Ghrelin was identified in the stomach as an endogenous ligand specific for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( GHS-R ) .	
11724768_s1	GHS-R is found in various tissues , but its function is unknown .	
11724768_s2	Here we show that GHS-R is found in hepatoma cells .	
11724768_s3	Exposure of these cells to ghrelin caused up-regulation of several insulin-induced activities including tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 ( IRS-1 ) , association of the adapter molecule growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 with IRS-1 , mitogen-activated protein kinase activity , and cell proliferation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11724768_s4	Unlike insulin , ghrelin inhibited Akt kinase activity as well as up-regulated gluconeogenesis .	
11724768_s5	These findings raise the possibility that ghrelin modulates insulin activities in humans .	
11773160_s0	PURPOSE The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 ( Iressa ; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals , Alderley Park , United Kingdom ) is under development as an anticancer agent .	
11773160_s1	We studied the pharmacodynamic effects of ZD1839 on EGFR in the skin , an EGFR-dependent tissue , in cancer patients participating in ZD1839 phase I clinical trials .	
11773160_s2	PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied 104 pre- and/or on-ZD1839 therapy ( approximately at day 28 of therapy ) skin biopsies from 65 patients receiving escalating doses of daily oral ZD1839 .	
11773160_s3	We measured ZD1839 effects on EGFR activation by immunohistochemistry using an antibody specific for the activated ( phosphorylated ) EGFR .	
11773160_s4	Effects on receptor signaling ( activated mitogen-activated protein kinase [ MAPK] ) , proliferation , p27(KIP1) , and maturation were also assessed .	
11773160_s5	RESULTS Histopathologically , the stratum corneum of the epidermis was thinner during therapy ( P &lt;.001 ) .	
11773160_s6	In hair follicles , prominent keratin plugs and microorganisms were found in dilated infundibula .	
11773160_s7	ZD1839 suppressed EGFR phosphorylation in all EGFR-expressing cells ( P &lt;.001 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11773160_s8	In addition , ZD1839 inhibited MAPK activation ( P &lt;.001 ) and reduced keratinocyte proliferation index ( P &lt;.001 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11773160_s9	Concomitantly , ZD1839 increased the expression of p27(KIP1) ( P &lt;.001 ) and maturation markers ( P &lt;.001 ) and increased apoptosis ( P &lt;.001 ) .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
11773160_s10	These effects were observed at all dose levels , before reaching dose-limiting toxicities .	
11773160_s11	CONCLUSION ZD1839 inhibits EGFR activation and affects downstream receptor-dependent processes in vivo .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11773160_s12	These effects were profound at doses well below the one producing unacceptable toxicity , a finding that strongly supports pharmacodynamic assessments to select optimal doses instead of a maximum-tolerated dose for definitive efficacy and safety trials .	
11774243_s0	Adoptive transfer of immunity against hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) was previously shown to facilitate suppression of experimental human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) expressing HBsAg in athymic mice .	
11774243_s1	We have shown that oral tolerance induces antigen-specific immune suppression of HBsAg by feeding hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) antigens .	
11774243_s2	In the present study we evaluated the effect of oral tolerance induction toward HBV or HCC antigens on the growth of experimental HCC-expressing HBsAg in mice .	
11774243_s3	Tolerance induction was induced in mice by 5 oral feedings of 1 microg HBV antigens or HCC-extracted proteins ( 50 microg protein ) before vaccination with recombinant HBsAg .	
11774243_s4	Splenocytes ( 2 x 10(6) ) from these mice were transferred to sublethally irradiated athymic BALB/c mice previously transplanted subcutaneously with 10(7) human hepatoma Hep3B cells .	
11774243_s5	Adoptive transfer of splenocytes immunized toward HBsAg prevented tumor growth .	
11774243_s6	At 4 weeks after splenocyte transplantation , tumor volume and serum alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) levels in athymic mice transplanted with splenocytes immunized to HBsAg were undetectable as compared with 1,048 +/- 738 mm(3) and 2,500 +/- 1,431 ng/ml in recipients of naï¿½ve splenocytes ( p &lt ; 0.0001 ) .	
11774243_s7	Mice receiving splenocytes tolerized toward Hep3B cells , as manifested by reduced serum HBs antibody levels , reduced HBV-specific stimulation index and reduced HBV-specific-IFN gamma spot-forming cells , had early tumor growth evident by elevated AFP serum levels , weight loss and mortality , which were suppressed at 6 weeks .	
11774243_s8	Mice transplanted with splenocytes tolerized toward HBV antigens did not have direct evidence of tumor growth .	
11774243_s9	Induction of oral tolerance toward HCC-extracted proteins enabled transient tumor growth in this model .	
11774243_s10	This effect was mediated through downregulation of the anti-HBV immune response .	avoiding immune destruction
11781072_s0	The secretion of immunosuppressive factors like transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) by tumor cells has been recognized as one of the mechanisms involved in tumor immunological escape .	
11781072_s1	This study aimed to examine whether dendritic cell ( DC ) immunization could reverse TGF-beta-induced immunosuppression by simulating the in vivo interaction among infused DCs , host T cells , and tumor-secreted TGF-beta in an in vitro study .	
11781072_s2	We found that both immature and mature DCs were relatively resistant to TGF-beta .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11781072_s3	The addition of TGF-beta to naive human CD4+ T cells , which are required by genetically modified DC to elicit antitumor immunity , resulted in their hyporesponsiveness to DC stimulation in a dose-dependent manner .	avoiding immune destruction,sustaining proliferative signaling
11781072_s4	When activated by allogeneic DCs in the presence of TGF-beta , CD4+ T cells displayed a reduced capacity to proliferate .	
11781072_s5	More importantly , activated CD4+ T cells induced by DC stimulation were very sensitive to TGF-beta , and this susceptibility was enhanced by their previous exposure to TGF-beta .	avoiding immune destruction,sustaining proliferative signaling
11781072_s6	The underlying mechanism was linked to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis of activated T cells .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
11781072_s7	However , the presence of stimulation from DC or antibodies to CD3 plus CD28 could partly reverse the immunosuppressive effect of TGF-beta on activated CD4+ T cells .	avoiding immune destruction
11781072_s8	Taken together , our results indicate that the efficacy of DC immunization may be impaired by tumor-derived TGF-beta .	
11791181_s0	To characterize the impact of increased production of TGF-beta in a xenograft model of human breast cancer , TGF-beta-responsive MDA-231 cells were genetically modified by stable transfection so as to increase their production of active TGF-beta1 .	
11791181_s1	Compared with control cells , cells that produced increased amounts of TGF-beta proliferated in vitro more slowly .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11791181_s2	In vivo , however , tumors derived from these cells exhibited increased proliferation and grew at an accelerated pace .	
11791181_s3	To evaluate the role of autocrine TGF-beta signaling , cells were also transfected with a dominant-negative truncated type II TGF-beta receptor ( TbetaRII ) .	
11791181_s4	Disruption of autocrine TGF-beta signaling in the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells reduced their in vivo growth rate .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11791181_s5	Co-inoculation of Matrigel with the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells expressing the truncated TbetaRII compensated for their diminished in vivo growth capacity , compared with the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells with an intact autocrine loop .	
11791181_s6	Tissue invasion by the tumor was a distinctive feature of the TGF-beta-overexpressing cells , whether or not the autocrine loop was intact .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
11791181_s7	Furthermore , tumors derived from TGF-beta-overexpressing cells , irrespective of the status of the autocrine TGF-beta-signaling pathway , had a higher incidence of lung metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
11791181_s8	Consistent with the suggestion that TGF-beta's enhancement of invasion and metastasis is paracrine-based , we observed no significant differences among the cell clones in an in vitro invasion assay .	activating invasion and metastasis
11791181_s9	Thus , in this experimental model system in vitro assays of cell proliferation and invasion do not accurately reflect in vivo observations , perhaps due to autocrine and paracrine effects of TGF-beta that influence the important in vivo-based phenomena of tumor growth , invasion , and metastasis .	
11802212_s0	The involvement of PRL in regulating monocyte/macrophage functions is suggested by the presence of PRL-Rs in these cells .	
11802212_s1	Here , we show that PRL , though it failed to activate mouse peritoneal resident macrophages ( RMs ) , acted as a second signal and activated mouse peritoneal inflammatory macrophages ( EMs ) to a tumoricidal state .	tumor promoting inflammation
11802212_s2	The cytotoxicity of mouse tumor-associated macrophages ( TAMs ) isolated at day 1 of tumor ( Ehrlich ascites carcinoma , EAC ) growth was enhanced by PRL .	
11802212_s3	However , with progression of tumor growth , TAMs became nonresponsive to the hormone .	
11802212_s4	PRL-induced killing of P815 target cells by EMs and TAMs was independent of TNF but correlated with the hormone-induced augmentation of NO2(-) and O2(-) release in these macrophages .	
11802212_s5	Administration of PRL in vivo inhibited EAC growth and augmented NO2(-) release by TAMs .	
11802212_s6	PRL synergized with the TH1 cytokine IFN-gamma , a known activator of macrophages , in inducing tumor killing and release of NO2(-) from EMs and TAMs .	
11802212_s7	The hormone might activate macrophages at least partially , through the release of IFN-gamma as anti-IFN-gamma blocked IFN-gamma- as well as PRL-induced cytotoxicity in EMs .	
11802212_s8	The TH2 cytokine IL-4 suppressed PRL-induced activation of macrophages .	
11802212_s9	PRL induced release of IL-12 from EMs also , which suggested that the hormone might drive the TH1 response through IL-12 .	
11802212_s10	Our observations further suggest that PRL alone and in synergy with IFN-gamma , released through induction of IL-12 , may generate tumoricidal macrophages and thus regulate the antitumor immune response of tumor hosts .	tumor promoting inflammation
11812999_s0	Primary fibroblasts respond to activated H-RAS(V12) by undergoing premature arrest , which resembles replicative senescence .	
11812999_s1	This irreversible ' fail-safe mechanism ' requires p19(ARF) , p53 and the Retinoblastoma ( Rb ) family : upon their disruption , RAS(V12)-expressing cells fail to undergo senescence and continue to proliferate .	
11812999_s2	Similarly , co-expression of oncogenes such as c-MYC or E1A rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence .	
11812999_s3	To identify novel genes that allow escape from RAS(V12)-induced senescence , we designed an unbiased , retroviral complementary DNA library screen .	
11812999_s4	We report on the identification of DRIL1 , the human orthologue of the mouse Bright and Drosophila dead ringer transcriptional regulators .	
11812999_s5	DRIL1 renders primary murine fibroblasts unresponsive to RAS(V12)-induced anti-proliferative signalling by p19(ARF)/p53/p21(CIP1) , as well as by p16(INK4a) .	
11812999_s6	In this way , DRIL1 not only rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence but also causes these fibroblasts to become highly oncogenic .	enabling replicative immortality
11812999_s7	Furthermore , DRIL1 immortalizes mouse fibroblasts , in the presence of high levels of p16(INK4a) .	enabling replicative immortality
11812999_s8	Immortalization by DRIL1 , whose product binds the pRB-controlled transcription factor E2F1 ( ref. 8 ) , is correlated with induction of E2F1 activity .	enabling replicative immortality
11812999_s9	Correspondingly , DRIL1 induces the E2F1 target Cyclin E1 , overexpression of which is sufficient to trigger escape from senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
11812999_s10	Thus , DRIL1 disrupts cellular protection against RAS(V12)-induced proliferation downstream of the p19(ARF)/p53 pathway .	
11821958_s0	Oncostatin M ( OSM ) , an interleukin-6 type cytokine , acts via the gp130 signaling receptor to inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation of breast cancer cells .	
11821958_s1	EGF , a mitogen for breast cells , signals via EGFR/ErbB tyrosine kinase receptors which are implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis .	
11821958_s2	Here we show paradoxically that EGF enhanced the OSM-induced inhibition of proliferation and induction of cellular differentiation in both estrogen receptor positive and negative breast cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11821958_s3	This functional synergism was also seen with heregulin but not SCF , PDGF or IGF-1 , indicating that it was specific to EGF-related growth factors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11821958_s4	Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that gp130 was constitutively associated with ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 .	
11821958_s5	There was a similar association between the OSMRbeta and ErbB-2 .	
11821958_s6	Furthermore , EGF unexpectedly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 .	
11821958_s7	We show that OSM induced phosphorylation of STAT3 .	
11821958_s8	Both OSM and EGF activated the p42/44 MAP kinases , but while the MEK inhibitor , PD98059 , ablated the OSM-induced inhibition , it only partially ablated the inhibitory effects of OSM plus EGF .	
11821958_s9	Thus , we have demonstrated that the receptors and signalling pathways of two apparently unrelated growth factors were intimately linked , resulting in an unexpected biological effect .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11821958_s10	This provides a new mechanism for generating signalling diversity and has potential clinical implications in breast cancer .	
11830522_s0	p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in many human malignancies , including gastric cancer .	
11830522_s1	It remains unclear why patients with germ-line p53 mutations ( i.e. , Li-Fraumeni syndrome ) are not at increased risk for gastric adenocarcinoma , despite the fact that they show a high rate of many other tumors .	
11830522_s2	Furthermore , the precise relationship between germ-line p53 mutations and the response to chronic bacterial infections ( such as Helicobacter spp. ) has not been investigated .	
11830522_s3	To assess the role of germ-line p53 deletions in modulating the progression to gastric cancer , p53(+/-) and wild-type ( WT ) C57BL/6 mice were infected with H. felis .	
11830522_s4	The gastric pathology and immune response in these two groups of mice were analyzed for up to 15 months postinfection .	
11830522_s5	The gastric fundus and antrum were evaluated independently using a 0-4 scale to score inflammation , parietal and chief cell loss , mucus metaplasia , and helicobacter colonization .	
11830522_s6	Nonparametric statistical analysis was performed to determine the effects of p53(+/-) , infection status , and postinoculation ( p.i. ) time on inflammation , preneoplastic changes , invasive lesions , and helicobacter colonization. mRNA expression for gammaIFN , interleukin ( IL)-1 , IL-10 , and IL-4 was quantified by PCR .	
11830522_s7	Sera were also evaluated for H. felis antibody by ELISA .	
11830522_s8	Antral inflammation increased significantly with time in infected mice .	tumor promoting inflammation
11830522_s9	There was a significant , protective effect on the development of preneoplastic fundic lesions and invasive carcinoma attributable to the deletion of one p53 allele ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
11830522_s10	Submucosal invasive foci were observed in 9 of 11 WT-infected mice ranging from 13 to 15 months p.i. ; invasion of adjacent submucosal blood vessels by glandular epithelia also was present in 5 of these mice .	activating invasion and metastasis
11830522_s11	None of these lesions were observed in 33 p53(+/-) mice , infected or not , at any time p.i. p53(+/-) mice had significantly higher helicobacter colonization consistent with a Th2 host response .	
11830522_s12	In sera from WT mice , IgG2a , considered a proinflammatory Th1 response , continued to rise throughout the 15-month study ( P &lt ; 0.004 ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
11830522_s13	In contrast , IgG2a levels of the p53(+/-) mice were 50-60% lower than those of the WT mice at each time point ( P range , &lt;0.012 to 0.002 ) and did not progress in magnitude between 12 and 15 months of chronic H. felis infection ( P = 0.167). mRNA levels for gammaIFN and IL-1 were significantly up-regulated in WT mice infected with H. felis ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) but were slightly elevated or were at background levels in p53(+/-) mice .	
11830522_s14	IL-10 and IL-4 mRNA expression was not significantly different from control samples .	
11830522_s15	Our results support the hypothesis that germ-line deletion of one p53 allele results in a down-regulated Th1 response to gastric helicobacter infection , possibly because of T-cell senescence , which may indirectly protect against the development of gastric cancer and other epithelial-derived neoplasms associated with chronic inflammation .	enabling replicative immortality,tumor promoting inflammation
11836256_s0	Cellular senescence forms a barrier that inhibits the acquisition of an immortal phenotype , a critical feature in tumorigenesis .	
11836256_s1	The inactivation of multiple pathways that positively regulate senescence are required for immortalization .	
11836256_s2	To identify these pathways in an unbiased manner , we performed DNA microarray analyses to assess the expression of 20,000 genes in human prostate epithelial cells ( HPECs ) passaged to senescence .	
11836256_s3	These gene expression patterns were then compared with those of HPECs immortalized with the human Papillomavirus 16 E7 oncoprotein .	
11836256_s4	Senescent cells display gene expression patterns that reflect their nonproliferative , differentiated phenotype and express secretory proteases and extracellular matrix components .	
11836256_s5	A comparison of genes transcriptionally up-regulated in senescence to those in which expression is significantly down-regulated in immortalized HPECs identified three genes : the chemokine BRAK , DOC1 , and a member of the insulin-like growth factor axis , IGFBP-3 .	enabling replicative immortality
11836256_s6	Expression of these genes is found to be uniformly lost in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts , and previously , their inactivation was documented in tumor samples .	
11836256_s7	Thus , these genes may function in novel pathways that regulate senescence and are inactivated during immortalization .	enabling replicative immortality
11836256_s8	These changes may be critical not only in allowing cells to bypass senescence in vitro but in the progression of prostate cancer in vivo .	enabling replicative immortality
11836618_s0	Overexpression and amplification of cyclin D1 were investigated by immunohistochemistry and differential polymerase chain reaction ( dPCR ) in 440 formalin-fixed primary breast carcinoma tissues .	
11836618_s1	Overexpression of cyclin D1 was detected in 60% ( 263/440 ) and amplification of cyclin D1 was noted in 27% ( 119/440 ) of the primary breast carcinomas .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11836618_s2	Molecular analysis demonstrated that cyclin D1 was amplified in 30% ( 7/23 ) of the comedo DCIS , 22% ( 9/41 ) of the comedo DCIS and 32% ( 13/41 ) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas , 30% ( 82/270 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas , 27% ( 9/33 ) of the invasive lobular carcinomas , 19% ( 4/21 ) of the colloid carcinomas and 13% ( 2/15 ) of the medullary carcinomas .	
11836618_s3	Cyclin D1 was amplified in 11% ( 2/19 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas but not in the adjacent non-comedo DCIS lesions .	
11836618_s4	Our observation showed that cyclin D1 was strongly positive in 61% ( 14/23 ) of the comedo subtype , 61% ( 11/18 ) of the non-comedo subtype , 59% ( 24/41 ) of the comedo DCIS and 63% ( 26/41 ) of the adjacent invasive ductal carcinomas , 53% ( 10/19 ) of the non-comedo DCIS and 58% ( 11/19 ) of the adjacent invasive lesions , 58% ( 157/270 ) of the invasive ductal carcinomas , 73% ( 24/33 ) of the invasive lobular carcinomas , 52% ( 11/21 ) of the colloid carcinomas and 27% ( 4/15 ) of the medullary carcinomas .	
11836618_s5	A significant association was observed between in situ components and adjacent invasive lesions for cyclin D1 expression ( p&lt;0.05 ) and amplification ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	
11836618_s6	A significant relationship was noted between amplification of cyclin D1 and lymph node metastases ( p&lt;0.05 ) but not with histological grade ( p&gt;0.05 ) , estrogen receptor status ( p&gt;0.05 ) and proliferation index ( Ki-67 and PCNA ) ( p&gt;0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
11836618_s7	However , overexpression of cyclin D1 was statistically associated with well differentiated tumors ( p&lt;0.05 ) and estrogen receptor positivity ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11836618_s8	No relationship was seen with nodal status ( p&gt;0.05 ) and proliferation index ( Ki-67 and PCNA ) ( p&gt;0.05 ) .	
11836618_s9	These observations suggest that tumors positive for cyclin D1 protein may have features of good prognosis but amplification of cyclin D1 gene could be an indicator of tumors with poor prognostic features .	
11836618_s10	Although majority of the Malaysian patients belong to younger age group ( &lt;50 years old ) , amplification and expression of cyclin D1 was not statistically associated with patient age ( p&gt;0.05 ) .	
11836618_s11	These observations indicate that amplification and up-regulation of cyclin D1 may be independent of patient age .	
11836618_s12	Moreover , overexpression and amplification of cyclin D1 in preinvasive , preinvasive and adjacent invasive lesions , and invasive carcinomas suggest that the gene may play an important role in early and late stages of breast carcinogenesis .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
11849319_s0	Interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) has pleiotropic activities other than its antivirus action , including cell growth inhibition , natural killer ( NK ) cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) activation , and angiogenesis inhibitory activity , and these activities are supposed to be involved in its antitumour activity .	
11849319_s1	However , it has not been completely elucidated which activity is mainly involved in the tumour suppression in vivo .	
11849319_s2	In this study , we analysed inhibitory mechanisms of endogenous IFN-gamma against B16 melanoma experimental metastasis .	
11849319_s3	After intravenous injection of tumour cells , tumour deposits in the lungs and liver were increased and life span was shorter in IFN-gamma(-/-) mice , indicating important roles for IFN-gamma in antitumour mechanisms .	
11849319_s4	Interestingly , tumour deposits were not increased in IFN-gamma receptor ( R)(-/- ) mice .	
11849319_s5	Furthermore , only low levels of cell-mediated immunity against the tumour and activation of NK cells were observed , indicating that antimetastatic effects of IFN-gamma is not mediated by host cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
11849319_s6	The survival period of B16 melanoma-bearing IFN-gamma R(-/-) mice was , however , shorter than wild-type mice .	
11849319_s7	These observations suggest that IFN-gamma prevents B16 melanoma experimental metastasis by directly inhibiting the cell growth , although antitumour host functions may also be involved in a later phase .	activating invasion and metastasis
11850815_s0	P53 activity plays a key role in mammalian cells when they undergo replicative senescence at their Hayflick limit .	
11850815_s1	To determine whether p63 proteins , members of the family of p53-related genes , are also involved in this process , we examined their expression in serially passaged rat embryo fibroblasts .	
11850815_s2	Upon senescence , two truncated DeltaNp63 proteins decreased in abundance whereas two TAp63 isoforms accumulated. 2-D gel analysis showed that the DeltaNp63 proteins underwent post-translational modifications in both proliferating and senescent cells .	enabling replicative immortality
11850815_s3	Direct binding of DeltaNp63 proteins to a p53 consensus motif was greater in proliferating cells than senescent cells .	enabling replicative immortality
11850815_s4	In contrast p63alpha isoforms bound to DNA in a p53 dependent manner and this was higher in senescent cells than proliferating cells .	enabling replicative immortality
11850815_s5	An interaction of p63alpha proteins with SV40 large tumour antigen was also detected and ectopic expression of DeltaNp63alpha can extend the lifespan of rat embryo fibroblasts .	
11850815_s6	Taken together the results indicate that p63 proteins may play a role in replicative senescence either by competition for p53 DNA binding sites or by direct interaction with p53 protein bound to DNA .	enabling replicative immortality
11857086_s0	Mesotheliomas are malignant tumors of the pleural and peritoneal membranes which are often associated with asbestos exposure and with Simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) infection .	
11857086_s1	Telomerase activity is repressed in somatic cells and tissues but is activated in immortal and malignant cells .	
11857086_s2	We evaluated telomerase activity in seven primary malignant mesothelioma biopsies and matched lung specimens and 20 mesothelioma cell lines and eight corresponding primary tumor cultures .	
11857086_s3	All the tumor biopsies , and nearly all primary cell mesothelioma cultures and cell lines were telomerase positive .	
11857086_s4	The findings in cell lines paralleled those observed in primary cultures in cases where paired samples were available .	
11857086_s5	Next , we found that SV40 , a DNA tumor virus present in approximately 50% of mesothelioma biopsies in the USA , induced telomerase activity in primary human mesothelial cells , but not in primary fibroblasts .	
11857086_s6	Telomerase activity became detectable as early as 72 h following wild-type ( strain 776 ) SV40 infection , and a clear DNA ladder was detectable 1 week after infection .	
11857086_s7	The amount of telomerase activity increased during passage in cell culture and appeared to parallel increases in the cellular amounts of the SV40 large T-antigen .	
11857086_s8	Thus , SV40 infection leads to telomerase activity before the infected mesothelial cells become transformed and immortalized .	enabling replicative immortality
11857086_s9	SV40 infection of human fibroblasts did not cause detectable telomerase activity .	
11857086_s10	We also determined that the SV40 small t-antigen ( tag ) plays an important role in inducing telomerase activity because this activity was undetectable or minimal in mesothelial cells infected and/or transformed by SV40 tag mutants .	
11857086_s11	Asbestos alone did not induce telomerase activity , and asbestos did not influence telomerase activity in mesothelial cells infected with SV40 .	
11857086_s12	Induction of telomerase activity by SV40 may be related to the very high rate of mesothelial cell immortalization that is characteristically associated with SV40 infection of mesothelial cells .	enabling replicative immortality
11877436_s0	Treatment of cells with the anti-cancer drug camptothecin ( CPT ) induces topoisomerase I ( Top1)-mediated DNA damage , which in turn affects cell proliferation and survival .	
11877436_s1	In this report , we demonstrate that treatment of the wild-type HCT116 ( wt HCT116 ) human colon cancer cell line and the isogenic p53(-/-) HCT116 and p21(-/-) HCT116 cell lines with a high concentration ( 250 nm ) of CPT resulted in apoptosis , indicating that apoptosis occurred by a p53- and p21-independent mechanism .	resisting cell death
11877436_s2	In contrast , treatment with a low concentration ( 20 nm ) of CPT induced cell cycle arrest and senescence of the wt HCT116 cells , but apoptosis of the p53(-/-) HCT116 and p21(-/-) HCT116 cells .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
11877436_s3	Further investigations indicated that p53-dependent expression of p21 blocked apoptosis of wt HCT116 cells treated with 20 nm , but not 250 nm CPT .	resisting cell death
11877436_s4	Interestingly , blocking of the apoptotic pathway , by Z-VAD-FMK , in p21(-/-) HCT116 cells following treatment with 20 nm CPT did not permit the cells to develop properties of senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
11877436_s5	These observations demonstrated that p21 was required for senescence development of HCT116 cells following treatment with low concentrations of CPT .	enabling replicative immortality
11896073_s0	AIMS Tumour cell growth results from a disturbance in the balance between the rate of proliferation and cell death .	
11896073_s1	In this study , proteins involved in the regulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were studied as possible factors responsible for uncontrolled cell growth in colorectal cancer .	
11896073_s2	METHODS The expression of proteins involved in these processes was investigated in 48 metastases from patients with colorectal cancer and compared with eight normal colon mucosa samples and 14 primary tumours .	
11896073_s3	Both primary tumours and metastases were obtained from eight patients .	
11896073_s4	The expression of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , p53 , retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) , Fas receptor , Fas ligand , bcl-2 , mcl-1 , bax , and bcl-x was measured using immunohistochemistry .	
11896073_s5	Proliferation was determined by Ki67 staining , whereas apoptosis was assessed by M30 immunostaining , which recognises cleaved cytokeratin 18 .	
11896073_s6	RESULTS In the limited number of cases in which paired comparisons were possible , the expression of TS and Ki67 was significantly higher in metastases than in the matched primary tumour samples ( p = 0.014 and 0.016 , respectively ) , whereas Rb expression was lower in metastases than in primary tumours ( p = 0.024 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
11896073_s7	Fas receptor expression was high in normal mucosa but absent in primary tumours and metastases , whereas the opposite was seen for p53 .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
11896073_s8	The expression of bax , mcl-1 , and bcl-x in normal mucosa was more apical than that seen in malignant cells , where a more diffuse expression pattern was seen ( p &lt ; 0.04 ) .	
11896073_s9	Apoptosis was more abundant in primary tumours than in metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
11896073_s10	CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that proliferation and apoptosis are disturbed during colorectal cancer progression , and this is accompanied by loss of Rb and Fas expression , the accumulation of p53 and TS , and changes in the expression patterns of bax , mcl-1 , and bcl-xl .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
11901535_s0	It is well known that cell-mediated immunity is suppressed in patients with neoplastic diseases .	
11901535_s1	We have reported that soluble receptors for interleukin-2 ( sIL-2R ) and tumor necrosis factor ( sTNF-R1 ) are elevated in the serum of patients with advanced colorectal cancer .	
11901535_s2	The presence of these soluble receptors and immunosuppressive cytokines , including interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) , might be important in the mechanisms of immunosuppression. cis-Diaminedichloroplatinum ( cisplatin ) has been reported to immunomodulate , especially when used in low dose in combination with 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) .	
11901535_s3	In this study , cisplatin and UFT , a form of uracil and tegafur which is a prodrug of 5-FU , were administered with immunomodulator Polysaccharide K ( PSK ) to ten patients with colorectal cancer , who showed distant metastasis in the liver or lung , and the serum levels of sIL-2R and sTNF-R1 and the production of gamma-interferon ( gamma-INF ) and interleukin-10 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured .	activating invasion and metastasis
11901535_s4	The serum concentrations of sIL-2R and the production of IL-10 were reduced ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) after 2 months of treatment .	
11901535_s5	Thus , this combination appeared to have immunomodulative potential in patients with advanced colorectal cancer .	avoiding immune destruction
11912168_s0	Often the use of cytotoxic drugs in cancer therapy results in stable disease rather than regression of the tumor , and this is typically seen as a failure of treatment .	
11912168_s1	We now show that DNA damage is able to induce senescence in tumor cells expressing wild-type p53 .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
11912168_s2	We also show that cytotoxics are capable of inducing senescence in tumor tissue in vivo .	enabling replicative immortality
11912168_s3	Our results suggest that p53 and p21 play a central role in the onset of senescence , whereas p16(INK4a) function may be involved in maintaining senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
11912168_s4	Thus , like apoptosis , senescence appears to be a p53-induced cellular response to DNA damage and an important factor in determining treatment outcome .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
11914273_s0	Senescence limits the proliferative capacity of primary cells in culture .	
11914273_s1	We describe here a genetic screen to identify genes that allow bypass of this checkpoint .	
11914273_s2	Using retroviral cDNA expression libraries , we identify BCL6 as a potent inhibitor of senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
11914273_s3	BCL6 is frequently activated in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma , but its mechanism of action has remained unclear .	
11914273_s4	BCL6 efficiently immortalizes primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cooperates with RAS in oncogenic transformation .	enabling replicative immortality
11914273_s5	BCL6 overrides the senescence response downstream of p53 through a process that requires induction of cyclin D1 expression , as cyclin D1 knockout fibroblasts are specifically resistant to BCL6 immortalization .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
11914273_s6	We show that BCL6 expression also dramatically extends the replicative lifespan of primary human B cells in culture and induces cyclin D1 expression , indicating that BCL6 has a similar activity in lymphoid cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11914273_s7	Our results suggest that BCL6 contributes to oncogenesis by rendering cells unresponsive to antiproliferative signals from the p19(ARF)-p53 pathway .	
11914642_s0	Proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) is a nuclear receptor , which mainly associates with adipogenesis , but also appears to facilitate cell differentiation or apoptosis in certain malignant cells .	
11914642_s1	This apoptosis induction by PPARgamma is increased by co-stimulation with tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) , a member of the TNF family .	
11914642_s2	In this study , we investigated the effect of PPARgamma on Fas-mediated apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cell lines .	
11914642_s3	PPARgamma was expressed on all seven HCC cell lines and located in their nuclei. 15-Deoxy-Delta-12,14-prostaglandin J2 ( 15d- PGJ2 ) , a PPARgamma ligand , inhibited cellular proliferation in HepG2 , SK-Hep1 or HLE cells , unlike pioglitazone , another PPARgamma ligand , which did not have a significant influence on proliferation of these cells .	
11914642_s4	However , 15d-PGJ2 facilitated Fas-mediated HCC apoptosis that could not be induced by Fas alone .	resisting cell death
11914642_s5	These results suggest that PPARgamma can augment TNF-family-induced apoptosis .	resisting cell death
11929636_s0	Inflammatory events have been associated with senile plaques , one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) .	
11929636_s1	It is believed that aggregated beta-amyloid ( betaA ) proteins , which form the core of these plaques , may be responsible for triggering the inflammatory reaction .	
11929636_s2	In the present study , the ability of aluminum ( Al ) to initiate similar inflammatory events was investigated in a human glioblastoma cell line .	
11929636_s3	A 6-day exposure to either lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or aluminum sulfate caused a significant increase in the rate of proliferation of the glioblastoma cells .	
11929636_s4	Both treatments also caused activation of the immune-responsive transcription factor NF-kappaB although there were time-related differences .	tumor promoting inflammation
11929636_s5	The levels of secreted cytokines , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) were both increased by the LPS treatment although exposure to Al decreased the secretion of the former while elevating the levels of the latter .	
11929636_s6	These events may be due to the activation of glial cells and subsequent stress response to either Al complexes or LPS .	
11929636_s7	Although exposure to either stress factor caused a stimulation of inflammatory markers , there were time-dependent differences in the response .	tumor promoting inflammation
11929636_s8	This may reflect the ability of the cells to discern different stress factors and thus orchestrate an innate immune response profile distinct to each immunogen .	tumor promoting inflammation
11929832_s0	Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that functions to maintain telomeres , the terminal DNA that protects chromosomal integrity , regulating cellular replicative life span .	
11929832_s1	Telomerase is not expressed in most normal human somatic cells but is active in stabilizing telomeres of certain self-renewing cell populations and most malignant cells , making the enzyme an appealing target for anticancer therapy .	
11929832_s2	We describe here a novel cross-species approach to telomerase inhibition .	
11929832_s3	Ectopic expression of the human telomerase catalytic reverse transcriptase component in murine cells inhibited endogenous murine telomerase activity .	
11929832_s4	Using this approach , telomerase inhibition in immortal murine fibroblasts resulted in critical telomere shortening , leading to slowed proliferation , abnormal morphology , altered cell cycle , and telomere dysfunction with cytogenetic instability , followed by apoptotic cell death .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
11929832_s5	Subpopulations of two telomerase-inhibited clones escaped widespread apoptosis , showing proliferative recovery in culture despite persistently inhibited telomerase activity with progressive telomere shortening and dysfunction .	resisting cell death
11929832_s6	This study , by targeting immortal murine cells for telomerase inhibition , demonstrates the importance of telomerase to murine cell immortalization and telomere maintenance .	enabling replicative immortality
11929832_s7	Moreover , the murine model used here should prove useful in further evaluating telomerase inhibition as an anticancer therapy .	
11953889_s0	A rare immunohistochemical study using 28 surgical sections of human chondrosarcoma revealed that 67.9% of tumour cells had weak ( 10-40% ) or strong ( &gt;40% ) positive immunoreaction for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11953889_s1	The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma mRNA and protein in human chondrosarcoma cell line OUMS-27 was also determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry , respectively .	
11953889_s2	Furthermore , the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ligands on cell proliferation and survival were investigated in OUMS-27 cells .	
11953889_s3	Pioglitazone , a selective ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma , and 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) ( 15d-PGJ(2) ) , a putative endogenous ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma , inhibited the proliferation of OUMS-27 cells in a dose-dependent manner .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11953889_s4	The mechanism of cytotoxic effects of 15d-PGJ(2) was via apoptosis as shown by DNA fragmentation using TUNEL stain and DNA ladder formation , and by ultrastructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy .	resisting cell death
11953889_s5	Flow-cytometric analysis using annexin-V-fluorescein and propidium iodide detected the early change of apoptosis , as well as necrosis of OUMS-27 cells at 4 h after co-incubation with 15d-PGJ(2) .	resisting cell death
11953889_s6	These results suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of chondrosarcoma , and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ligands , especially 15d-PGJ(2) , may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of human chondrosarcoma .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11964309_s0	Notch signaling controls cell fate decisions of hematopoietic progenitors by inhibiting certain steps of differentiation and inducing either self-renewal or differentiation toward lymphoid or myeloid lineages .	
11964309_s1	In addition , truncated Notch1 alleles could be associated with 10% of all cases of human T lymphoblastic leukemia and , when introduced into mouse bone marrow stem cells , cause T-cell neoplasms .	
11964309_s2	However , functional links between the abundant expression of intact Notch1 and oncogenesis are still lacking .	
11964309_s3	Here we show that Notch1 is highly expressed in B- and T-cell-derived tumor cells of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma .	
11964309_s4	We demonstrate a novel mechanism for the oncogenic capacity of Notch1 by showing that the interaction between intact Notch1 on tumor cells and its ligand Jagged1 dramatically induces proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis in vitro .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
11964309_s5	We further provide evidence that in Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma , Jagged1 is expressed in malignant and in bystander cells colocalizing with Notch1-positive tumor cells .	
11964309_s6	Notch1 signaling may therefore be activated in tumor cells by Jagged1 through homotypic or heterotypic cell-cell interactions , and it seems likely that these interactions contribute to lymphomagenesis in vivo .	
11964309_s7	Thus , our data suggest that activated Notch1 signaling plays an important role in the pathobiology of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma and that it might be a potential new target for treatment .	
11976323_s0	UVB from solar radiation is both an initiating and promoting agent for skin cancer .	
11976323_s1	We have found that primary human keratinocytes undergo an apoptotic response to UVB .	
11976323_s2	To determine whether these responses are altered during the course of immortalization , we examined markers of apoptosis in primary human foreskin keratinocytes ( HFK ) transduced with either a retroviral vector expressing the E6 and E7 genes of HPV-16 or with empty vector alone ( LXSN-HFK ) .	
11976323_s3	Whereas LXSN-HFK as well as early passage keratinocytes expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7 ( p7 E6/7-HFK ) were both moderately responsive to UVB irradiation , late passage-immortalized keratinocytes ( p27 E6/7-HFK ) were exquisitely sensitive to UVB-induced apoptosis .	resisting cell death
11976323_s4	After exposure to UVB , enhanced annexin V-positivity and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation were observed in p27 E6/7-HFK compared with either LXSN- or p7 E6/7-HFK .	
11976323_s5	Caspase-3 fluorometric activity assays as well as immunoblot analysis with antibodies to caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase revealed elevated caspase-3 activity and processing at lower UVB doses in p27 E6/7-HFK compared with LXSN- or p7 E6/7-HFK .	
11976323_s6	In addition , the caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO reduced the apoptotic response and increased survival of all three HFK types .	resisting cell death
11976323_s7	Immunoblot analysis revealed that caspase-8 was activated in all three cell types , but caspase-9 was only activated in p27 E6/7-HFK .	
11976323_s8	Cell cycle analysis further showed that only p27 E6/7-HFK exhibit G(2)/M accumulation that is enhanced by UVB treatment .	
11976323_s9	This accumulation was associated with a rapid down-regulation of Bcl-2 in these cells .	
11976323_s10	The immortalization process subsequent to the expression of HPV E6 and E7 may therefore determine UVB sensitivity by switching the mode of apoptosis from a caspase-8 to a Bcl-2-caspase-9-mediated pathway of apoptosis .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
11980647_s0	Prostate cancer ( PCA ) is the most common histological malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among North American men .	
11980647_s1	There has been considerable interest in the chemopreventative properties of selenium .	
11980647_s2	In this study , we assessed whether selenium inhibits cell growth and associated cell cycle regulatory proteins .	
11980647_s3	Human PCA cells ( LNCaP , PC3 , PC3-AR2 , and PC3-M ) were incubated with and without selenium ( Seleno-DL-methionine , 150 microM ) for 24 , 48 , and 72 h .	
11980647_s4	Cells were fixed and stained with propidium iodide for flow cytometry analysis .	
11980647_s5	In parallel experiments , total protein was extracted , immunoprecipitated with cyclin E antibody , and analyzed by Western blot for the expression of cell cycle markers .	
11980647_s6	Treatment with selenium caused G1 arrest and an 80% reduction in the S phase of LNCaP with no effect on PC3 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11980647_s7	However , PC3 cells transfected with the androgen receptor ( PC3-AR2 ) exhibited a G2/M arrest and a marked reduction ( 57% ) in the S phase during cell cycle progression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11980647_s8	In the analysis of cell cycle regulatory molecules , selenium-treated cells demonstrated a significant induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27 .	evading growth suppressors
11980647_s9	These data suggest that selenium possesses strong antiproliferative properties in regard to human PCA .	
11980647_s10	This effect appears to be dependent on the presence of a functioning androgen receptor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11980647_s11	This provides a theoretical basis for Phase III studies of selenium in PCA prevention .	
11980654_s0	Interactions of CD70 , a tumor necrosis factor-related cell surface ligand and its receptor , CD27 , are thought to play an important role for T- , B- , and natural killer-cell activation .	
11980654_s1	However , ligation of CD27 can also induce apoptosis .	
11980654_s2	Human glioblastoma is paradigmatic for cancer-associated immunosuppression .	
11980654_s3	We identified CD70 as a radioinducible gene in U87 MG glioma cells .	
11980654_s4	A screening of a panel of human glioma cell lines revealed that 11 of 12 cell lines expressed CD70 mRNA and protein .	
11980654_s5	Two human neuroblastoma cell lines did not express CD70 .	
11980654_s6	CD70 mRNA expression was enhanced by irradiation in 8 of 12 glioma cell lines in a p53-independent manner .	
11980654_s7	No alteration in CD70 expression was observed after glioma cell exposure to cytotoxic drugs such as lomustine .	
11980654_s8	CD70 protein was also detected by immunocytochemistry in 5 of 12 glioblastomas and 3 of 4 anaplastic astrocytomas in vivo .	
11980654_s9	CD27 expression was not detected in any glioma cell line , and there was no evidence for autocrine or backward signaling of the CD70 system in human glioma cells .	
11980654_s10	Unexpectedly , CD70 expressed on glioma cells did not increase the immunogenicity of glioma cells in vitro .	
11980654_s11	In contrast , CD70-positive glioma cells induced apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) in a CD70-dependent manner .	resisting cell death
11980654_s12	Neutralization of CD70 expressed on glioma cells prevented apoptosis and enhanced the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in cocultures of glioma cells and PBMCs .	resisting cell death
11980654_s13	The effects of CD70-expressing glioma cells on PBMCs were mimicked by agonistic CD27 antibodies .	resisting cell death
11980654_s14	Conversely , the shedding of CD27 by PBMCs was identified as a possible escape mechanism from glioma cell-induced CD70-dependent apoptosis .	resisting cell death
11980654_s15	Thus , induction of B-cell and T-cell apoptosis via interactions of CD70 expressed on glioma cells and CD27 expressed on B and T cells may be a novel way for the immune escape of malignant gliomas .	avoiding immune destruction,resisting cell death
11986236_s0	The t(10;11)(p12;q23) chromosomal translocation in human acute myeloid leukemia results in the fusion of the MLL and AF10 genes .	
11986236_s1	The latter codes for a novel leucine zipper protein , one of many MLL fusion partners of unknown function .	
11986236_s2	In this report , we demonstrate that retroviral-mediated transduction of an MLL-AF10 complementary DNA into primary murine myeloid progenitors enhanced their clonogenic potential in serial replating assays and led to their efficient immortalization at a primitive stage of myeloid differentiation .	
11986236_s3	Furthermore , MLL-AF10-transduced cells rapidly induced acute myeloid leukemia in syngeneic or severe combined immunodeficiency recipient mice .	
11986236_s4	Structure/function analysis showed that a highly conserved 82-amino acid portion of AF10 , comprising 2 adjacent alpha-helical domains , was sufficient for immortalizing activity when fused to MLL .	enabling replicative immortality
11986236_s5	Neither helical domain alone mediated immortalization , and deletion of the 29-amino acid leucine zipper within this region completely abrogated transforming activity .	enabling replicative immortality
11986236_s6	Similarly , the minimal oncogenic domain of AF10 exhibited transcriptional activation properties when fused to the MLL or GAL4 DNA-binding domains , while neither helical domain alone did .	
11986236_s7	However , transcriptional activation per se was not sufficient because a second activation domain of AF10 was neither required nor competent for transformation .	
11986236_s8	The requirement for alpha-helical transcriptional effector domains is similar to the oncogenic contributions of unrelated MLL partners ENL and ELL , suggesting a general mechanism of myeloid leukemogenesis by a subset of MLL fusion proteins , possibly through specific recruitment of the transcriptional machinery .	
12000222_s0	The retinoic acid receptor beta2 ( RARbeta2 ) protein is a putative tumor suppressor that inhibits proliferation and can induce apoptosis when introduced into breast , cervical , lung , and pancreatic cancer cell lines .	
12000222_s1	To determine if RARbeta2 suppresses proliferation of mammary-derived cancer cells in vivo , we transduced MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells with the LXSN retroviral vector containing RARbeta2 and implanted LXSN vector- or RARbeta2-transduced cells into the mammary fat pads of nude and severe combined immune deficiency ( SCID ) mice .	
12000222_s2	We analyzed the xenografts for several tumor parameters , including tumor size , inflammation , vascularity , mitoses , tumor recurrence at the primary site following resection , and metastases .	
12000222_s3	We found that 19 of 52 mice inoculated with vector-transduced cells developed metastases in multiple organs while only one of 55 mice receiving RARbeta2-transduced cells displayed evidence of metastases ( p &lt ; 0.000001 , combined experiments , two-tailed Fisher's exact test ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
12000222_s4	Moreover , RARbeta2-tumor cell recipient mice had a lower incidence of post-resection tumor recurrence ( 8/55 vs. 25/52 , p = 0.0004 ) , 34% less necrosis ( in three of four experiments , p = 0.001 ) , and 39% fewer mitoses in tumor tissue ( p &lt ; 0.000001 ) .	
12000222_s5	Our findings suggest that RARbeta2 may play a role in inhibiting the metastatic cascade in a mouse mammary gland xenograft tumor model and is a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in human breast cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis
12006491_s0	The yeast Sir2 protein mediates chromatin silencing through an intrinsic NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity .	
12006491_s1	Sir2 is a conserved protein and was recently shown to regulate lifespan extension both in budding yeast and worms .	
12006491_s2	Here , we show that SIRT1 , the human Sir2 homolog , is recruited to the promyelocytic leukemia protein ( PML ) nuclear bodies of mammalian cells upon overexpression of either PML or oncogenic Ras ( Ha-rasV12 ) .	
12006491_s3	SIRT1 binds and deacetylates p53 , a component of PML nuclear bodies , and it can repress p53-mediated transactivation .	
12006491_s4	Moreover , we show that SIRT1 and p53 co-localize in nuclear bodies upon PML upregulation .	
12006491_s5	When overexpressed in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) , SIRT1 antagonizes PML-induced acetylation of p53 and rescues PML-mediated premature cellular senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
12006491_s6	Taken together , our data establish the SIRT1 deacetylase as a novel negative regulator of p53 function capable of modulating cellular senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
12046072_s0	AIM The goal of this study was to characterize the AFP receptor , its possible signal transduction pathway and its proliferative functions in human hepatoma cell line Bel 7402 .	
12046072_s1	METHODS Cell proliferation enhanced by AFP was detected by MTT assay , 3H-thymidine incorporation and S-stage percentage of cell cycle analysis .	
12046072_s2	With radioactive labeled 125I-AFP for receptor binding assay ; cAMP accumulation , protein kinase A activity were detected by radioactive immunosorbent assay and the change of intracellular free calcium ( Ca2+i ) was monitored by scanning fluorescence intensity under TCS-NT confocal microscope .	
12046072_s3	The expression of oncogenes N- ras , p 53 , and p21( ras ) in the cultured cells in vitro were detected by Northern blotting and Western blotting respectively .	
12046072_s4	RESULTS It was demonstrated that AFP enhanced the proliferation of human hepatoma Bel 7402 cell in a dose dependent fashion as shown in MTT assay , ( 3)H-thymidine incorporation and S-phase percentage up to 2-fold .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12046072_s5	Two subtypes of AFP receptors were identified in the cells with Kds of 1.3 x 10(-9)mol.L(-1) and 9.9 x10(-8)mol .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12046072_s6	( -1)L respectively .	
12046072_s7	Pretreatment of cells with AFP resulted in a significant increase ( 625% ) in cAMP accumulation .	
12046072_s8	The activity of protein kinase A activity were increased up to 37.5 , 122.6 , 73.7 and 61.2% at treatment time point 2 , 6 , 12 and 24 hours .	
12046072_s9	The level of intracellular calcium were elevated after the treatment of alpha-fetoprotein and achieved to 204% at 4 min .	
12046072_s10	The results also showed that AFP(20mg.L(-1)) could upregulate the expression of N- ras oncogenes and p 53 and p21( ras ) in Bel 7402 cells .	
12046072_s11	In the later case,the alteration were 81.1%(12h) and 97.3%(12h) respectively compared with control .	
12046072_s12	CONCLUSION These results demonstrate that AFP is a potential growth factor to promote the proliferation of human hepatoma Bel 7402 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12046072_s13	Its growth-regulatory effects are mediated by its specific plasma membrane receptors coupled with its transmembrane signaling transduction through the pathway of cAMP-PKA and intracellular calcium to regulate the expression of oncogenes .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12060611_s0	PURPOSE Astrocytoma arises in the central nervous system as a tumor of great lethality , in part because of the invasive potential of the neoplastic cells that are able to release extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes .	
12060611_s1	Furin convertase activates several precursor matrix metalloproteases involved in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix .	
12060611_s2	In the present study inhibition of furin was achieved by gene transfer of alpha(1)-antitrypsin Portland ( PDX ) cDNA .	
12060611_s3	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN This furin inhibitor was transfected into two tumorigenic astrocytoma cell lines .	
12060611_s4	The inhibitory effect was evaluated using in vivo tumorigenicity , invasion , and proliferation assays , as well as by investigating impairment of furin substrate processing .	
12060611_s5	RESULTS Expression of PDX prevented the s.c. growth of the transfected cells .	
12060611_s6	Invasion assays demonstrated that PDX-transfected cells exhibited a reduced invasive ability in vitro and in vivo .	activating invasion and metastasis
12060611_s7	Furthermore , s.c. growth of PDX transfectant xenotransplants showed a significant reduction in size that coincided with a significant decrease of the in vitro doubling time and of the in vivo cell proliferation ability .	
12060611_s8	Additional studies showed that the furin substrates insulin-like growth factor IR , transforming growth factor beta and membrane type 1-matrix metalloprotease were not activated in PDX-expressing astrocytoma cells .	
12060611_s9	CONCLUSIONS PDX expression in astrocytoma cells demonstrated a direct mechanistic link between furin inhibition , and decreased astrocytoma proliferation and invasive ability .	
12060611_s10	Because furin inhibition inhibits both invasiveness and cell growth in astrocytoma , furin should be considered a promising target for glioblastoma therapy .	activating invasion and metastasis
12065244_s0	Elevated insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1 ( IGFBP-rP1 ) mRNA in senescent human mammary epithelial cells suggested that the IGFBP-3 gene product may inhibit cell proliferation .	
12065244_s1	To test this hypothesis , we used a retroviral vector to express IGFBP-rP1 cDNA in the IGFBP-rP1-deficient MCF-7 breast cancer cell line .	
12065244_s2	Compared with control vector-transduced cells , cumulative cell numbers for IGFBP-rP1-transduced polyclonal or clonal cell cultures were reduced by 39 and 74% , respectively , after 1 week .	
12065244_s3	Medium conditioned by IGFBP-rP1-producing cultures reduced cumulative cell numbers in parental MCF-7 cultures by 20% compared with medium from cultures of a control vector-transduced cell line .	
12065244_s4	Nuclear fragmentation analysis and cell proliferation assays completed in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone excluded apoptosis as the responsible mechanism .	resisting cell death
12065244_s5	The percentage of cells containing senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity was doubled compared with control cell cultures .	enabling replicative immortality
12065244_s6	Flow cytometry analysis indicated that twice as many noncycling cells were present in the IGFBP-rP1-transduced MCF-7 cell cultures compared with controls .	
12065244_s7	These findings indicate that IGFBP-rP1 is an inhibitor of MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation and may act via a cellular senescence-like mechanism .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
12082607_s0	We have modelled multiple stages of malignant transformation of human endothelial cells ( ECs ) by overexpressing the catalytic subunit of human telomerase ( hTERT ) , together with SV40 T antigen ( SV40T ) and oncogenic N-ras .	
12082607_s1	Transfection with hTERT alone , led to the immortalization of two out of three cultures of bone marrow-derived ECs ( BMECs ) .	enabling replicative immortality
12082607_s2	One hTERT transduced BMEC culture underwent a long proliferative lag before resuming proliferation .	
12082607_s3	BMECs transfected with hTERT alone were functionally and phenotypically normal .	
12082607_s4	BMECs transfected with SV40T ( BMSVTs ) had an extended lifespan , but eventually succumbed to crisis .	
12082607_s5	BMSVTs exhibited a partially transformed phenotype , demonstrating growth factor independence , altered antigen expression and forming tiny , infrequent colonies in vitro .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12082607_s6	Transduction of BMSVTs with hTERT resulted in immortalization of 4 out of 4 cultures .	enabling replicative immortality
12082607_s7	BMSVTs immortalized with hTERT formed large colonies in vitro and small transient tumours in vivo .	enabling replicative immortality
12082607_s8	BMECs co-expressing SV40T , hTERT and N-ras exhibited an overtly transformed phenotype ; forming very large colonies with an altered morphology and generating rapidly growing tumours in vivo .	
12082607_s9	These investigations demonstrate transformation of human ECs to an overtly malignant phenotype .	
12082607_s10	This model will be useful for understanding mechanisms underlying vascular and angiogenic neoplasias , as well as for testing drugs designed to curtail aberrant EC growth .	inducing angiogenesis
12082612_s0	The association between acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) and the aberrant expression of Hoxa9 is evidenced by ( 1 ) proviral activation of Hoxa9 and Meis1 in BXH-2 murine AML , ( 2 ) formation of the chimeric Nup98-HoxA9 transactivator protein as a consequence of the t(7;11) translocation in human AML , and ( 3 ) the strong expression of HoxA9 and Meis1 in human AML .	
12082612_s1	In mouse models , enforced retroviral expression of Hoxa9 alone in marrow is not sufficient to cause rapid AML , while co-expression of Meis1 and Hoxa9 induces rapid AML .	
12082612_s2	In contrast , retroviral expression of Nup98-HoxA9 is sufficient to cause rapid AML in the absence of enforced Meis1 expression .	
12082612_s3	Previously , we demonstrated that Hoxa9 could block the differentiation of murine marrow progenitors cultured in granulocyte-macrophage colony-simulating factor ( GM-CSF ) .	
12082612_s4	These progenitors lacked Meis1 expression , could not proliferate in stem cell factor ( SCF ) , but could differentiate into neutrophils when switched into granulocyte colony-simulating factor ( G-CSF ) .	
12082612_s5	Ectopic expression of Meis1 in these Hoxa9 cells suppressed their G-CSF-induced differentiation , permitted proliferation in SCF , and therein offered a potential explanation of cooperative function .	
12082612_s6	Because Meis1 binds N-terminal Hoxa9 sequences that are replaced by Nup98 , we hypothesized that Nup98-HoxA9 might consolidate the biochemical functions of both Hoxa9 and Meis1 on target gene promoters and might evoke their same lymphokine-responsive profile in immortalized progenitors .	
12082612_s7	Here we report that Nup98-HoxA9 , indeed mimicks Hoxa9 plus Meis1 coexpression - it immortalizes myeloid progenitors , prevents differentiation in response to GM-CSF , IL-3 , G-CSF , and permits proliferation in SCF .	enabling replicative immortality
12082612_s8	Unexpectedly , however , Nup98-Hoxa9 also enforced strong transcription of the cellular Hoxa9 , Hoxa7 and Meis1 genes at levels similar to those found in mouse AML's generated by proviral activation of Hoxa9 and Meis1 .	
12082612_s9	Using Hoxa9(-/-) marrow , we demonstrate that expression of Hoxa9 is not required for myeloid immortalization by Nup98-HoxA9 .	enabling replicative immortality
12082612_s10	Rapid leukaemogenesis by Nup98-HoxA9 may therefore result from both the intrinsic functions of Nup98-HoxA9 , as well as of those of coexpressed HOX and MEIS1 genes .	enabling replicative immortality
12084030_s0	BACKGROUND : Previously , we have observed that highly unsaturated dietary ( n-3 ) fatty acids inhibit cell proliferation in conjunction with stimulation of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein ( IGFBP)-6 secretion in Caco-2 cells , a human colon carcinoma cell line .	
12084030_s1	METHODS : To test the converse hypothesis that inhibition of endogenous IGFBP-6 secretion stimulates Caco-2 cell proliferation , cells were transfected with the antisense IGFBP-6 expression construct or pcDNA3 vector only , and single colonies resistant to G418 sulfate were isolated .	
12084030_s2	RESULTS : Our initial studies indicated that three antisense clones grew faster and produced less IGFBP-6 than two pcDNA3 clones , so antisense IGFBP-6 #5 and pcDNA3 #8 were selected for further detailed analysis .	
12084030_s3	Both the control and antisense clones grew in serum-free medium reaching a plateau density at day eight .	
12084030_s4	However , the antisense clone grew at a rate faster than that of the control and reached a final density that was 31 +/- 3% higher than the control .	
12084030_s5	Northern blot , ligand blot and immunoblot analyses revealed that accumulation of IGFBP-6 mRNA and concentrations of IGFBP-6 peptide produced by the antisense clone were decreased by 80-90% compared to the control .	
12084030_s6	The doubling times of the antisense and control clones were 21.9 +/- 0.4 and 24.8 +/- 0.3 h ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) , respectively .	
12084030_s7	Exogenous IGF-I and IGF-II ( 0.2-200 nmol/L ) stimulated proliferation of both the control and antisense clones in a dose-dependent manner , but the relative potency and efficacy of IGF-II was higher in the antisense clone compared to the control .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12084030_s8	These results indicate that suppression of IGFBP-6 secretion correlates with an increase in the basal rate of Caco-2 cell growth .	
12084030_s9	CONCLUSIONS : Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that IGFBP-6 inhibits cell growth by binding to endogenously produced IGF-II , thereby preventing IGF-II from interacting with the IGF-I receptor to stimulate cellular proliferation by an autocrine mechanism .	
12101184_s0	Direct experimental evidence implicates telomere erosion as a primary cause of cellular senescence .	
12101184_s1	Using a well characterized model system for breast cancer , we define here the molecular and cellular consequences of adriamycin treatment in breast tumor cells .	
12101184_s2	Cells acutely exposed to adriamycin exhibited an increase in p53 activity , a decline in telomerase activity , and a dramatic increase in beta-galactosidase , a marker of senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
12101184_s3	Inactivation of wild-type p53 resulted in a transition of the cellular response to adriamycin treatment from replicative senescence to delayed apoptosis , demonstrating that p53 plays an integral role in the fate of breast tumor cells treated with DNA-damaging agents .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
12101184_s4	Stable introduction of hTERT , the catalytic protein component of telomerase , into MCF-7 cells caused an increase in telomerase activity and telomere length .	
12101184_s5	Treatment of MCF-7-hTERT cells with adriamycin produced an identical senescence response as controls without signs of telomere shortening , indicating that the senescence after treatment is telomere length-independent .	enabling replicative immortality
12101184_s6	However , we found that exposure to adriamycin resulted in an overrepresentation of cytogenetic changes involving telomeres , showing an altered telomere state induced by adriamycin is probably a causal factor leading to the senescence phenotype .	enabling replicative immortality
12101184_s7	To our knowledge , these data are the first to demonstrate that the mechanism of adriamycin-induced senescence is dependent on both functional p53 and telomere dysfunction rather than overall shortening .	enabling replicative immortality
12112320_s0	The relationship between thyroid hormone ( triiodothyronine , T(3) ) and breast cancer is unclear .	
12112320_s1	We studied the effect of the c-erbA/TR alpha proto-oncogene encoding a functional T(3) receptor ( TR alpha 1 ) , of its ligand T(3) , and of its retroviral , mutated counterpart , the v-erbA oncogene , on the proliferation capacity of nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells ( EpH4 ) .	
12112320_s2	We found that EpH4 cells expressing ectopically TR ( EpH4 + TR alpha 1 ) or v-erbA ( EpH4 + v-erbA ) proliferated faster than parental EpH4 cells that contained low levels of endogenous TR .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12112320_s3	T(3) inhibited DNA synthesis and proliferation in EpH4 + TR alpha 1 cells but not EpH4 or EpH4 + v-erbA cells .	
12112320_s4	The study of cell-cycle genes showed that T(3) decreased cyclin D1 RNA and protein levels in EpH4 + TR alpha 1 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12112320_s5	In addition , T(3) downregulated the expression of T1 , a gene that is overexpressed in human breast adenocarcinomas and is induced by mitogens , serum , and several oncogenes and cytokines .	
12112320_s6	Inhibition of the T1 gene by T(3) required both de novo mRNA and protein synthesis .	
12112320_s7	Furthermore , T(3) abolished the induction of T1 by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and inhibited the activity of an activation protein 1-dependent promoter ( -73-Col-CAT ) in EpH4 + TR alpha 1 cells , suggesting that interference with activation protein 1 transcription factor plays a part in the inhibition of the T1 gene .	
12112320_s8	Our results showed that T(3) reduced the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells and inhibited the expression of cyclin D1 and T1 genes .	
12124174_s0	Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( uPAR ) activates alpha5beta1 integrin and ERK signaling , inducing in vivo proliferation of HEp3 human carcinoma .	
12124174_s1	Here we demonstrate that EGFR mediates the uPAR/integrin/fibronectin ( FN ) induced growth pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12124174_s2	Its activation is ligand-independent and does not require high EGFR , but does require high uPAR expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12124174_s3	Only when uPAR level is constitutively elevated does EGFR become alpha5beta1-associated and activated .	
12124174_s4	Domain 1 of uPAR is crucial for EGFR activation , and FAK links integrin and EGFR signaling .	
12124174_s5	Inhibition of EGFR kinase blocks uPAR induced signal to ERK , implicating EGFR as an important effector of the pathway .	
12124174_s6	Disruption of uPAR or EGFR signaling reduces HEp3 proliferation in vivo .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12124174_s7	These findings unveil a mechanism whereby uPAR subverts ligand-regulated EGFR signaling , providing cancer cells with proliferative advantage .	
12136428_s0	We have recently developed surface-shielded transferrin-polyethylenimine ( Tf-PEI)/DNA delivery systems that target reporter gene expression to distant tumors after systemic application .	
12136428_s1	In the present study , we used surface-shielded Tf-PEI/DNA complexes for delivering the gene for a highly potent cytokine , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) .	
12136428_s2	TNFalpha is known for its ability to induce hemorrhagic tumor necrosis and tumor regression .	
12136428_s3	However , the therapeutic application of TNFalpha is hampered by its high systemic toxicity dictating the need to target TNFalpha activity to the tumor .	
12136428_s4	Systemic application of surface-shielded Tf-PEI complexes with the TNFalpha gene resulted in preferential expression of TNFalpha in the tumor without detectable TNFalpha serum levels , in contrast to the application of nontargeted complexes .	
12136428_s5	Tumor-targeted TNFalpha gene delivery induced pronounced hemorrhagic tumor necrosis and inhibition of tumor growth in three murine tumor models of different tissue origins , Neuro2a neuroblastoma , MethA fibrosarcoma , and M-3 melanoma , with complete tumor regressions observed in the MethA model .	resisting cell death
12136428_s6	No systemic TNF-related toxicity was observed due to the localization of the TNFalpha activity to the tumor .	
12136428_s7	Targeted gene therapy may be an attractive strategy applicable to highly active , yet toxic , molecules such as TNFalpha .	
12139732_s0	Clinical data and biological samples were prospectively collected in 42 children with lymphoproliferative disease ( LPD ) secondary to organ/bone marrow transplant-related immunosuppression ( 30 : 11 liver , 10 heart/lung , 8 kidney and 1 bone marrow ) , other drug-induced immunosuppression ( 2 ) , congenital immunodeficiency ( 8 ) or human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV)-related immune dysfunction ( 2 ) .	
12139732_s1	Ages ranged from 10 months to 17 years and there were 15 girls .	
12139732_s2	Pathology was centrally reviewed and showed polymorphic features in 5 cases , monomorphic in 23 , mixed pattern in 5 patients and 9 other types .	
12139732_s3	Using the Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms , 5 were B lymphoblastoid , 24 were high-grade B and 14 were other subtypes .	
12139732_s4	Using the Pittsburgh classification , 9 were lymphadenopathic , 10 were systemic , 25 were lymphomatous and , with the Murphy grouping for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( NHL ) , 10 were localized and 32 non-localized .	
12139732_s5	Twenty-four out of 38 evaluable cases were Epstein-Barr virus positive .	
12139732_s6	Thirty-five patients were evaluable for clonality ; 24 were monoclonal and 11 were polyclonal .	
12139732_s7	Reduced immunosuppression in solid organ transplant patients resulted in resolution of disease in 14/24 , which was sustained in 11 .	avoiding immune destruction
12139732_s8	Nineteen patients received chemotherapy , 14/18 evaluable responded , which was sustained in 8 cases .	
12139732_s9	Seven out of 29 solid organ transplant and 10/13 other immune-deficient patients died .	
12139732_s10	In the largest group of patients , solid organ transplants , no significant clinical or biological characteristics that predicted outcome were identified .	
12139732_s11	In the transplant group close monitoring of response during reduction in immunosuppression is essential and the early use of B NHL chemotherapy may be effective .	avoiding immune destruction
12140138_s0	Epidemiological studies have indicated that females may be at greater risk of smoking associated lung cancer compared with males .	
12140138_s1	Several lines of biochemical evidence support these observations .	
12140138_s2	A possible role of circulating steroid hormones in the etiology of lung cancer has been hypothesized .	
12140138_s3	In the present paper , we have studied the expression of the estrogen receptors ( ER)-alpha and ER beta in histologically normal human lung tissue and lung tumor cell lines .	
12140138_s4	Relative ER mRNA levels were measured by reverse transcriptase-PCR and normalized to the level of expression of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene ( GAPDH ) .	
12140138_s5	In lung tissue , an ER alpha transcript was found at various levels in 38 out of 46 cases ( 83% ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12140138_s6	ER beta was expressed in all cases .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12140138_s7	The ERs were expressed at similar levels in females and males , and the levels of ER alpha and ER beta mRNA were significantly related ( P&lt;0.0001 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12140138_s8	Compared with the lung tissue , ER expression levels were lower in 16 human lung tumor cell lines and two immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell lines .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12140138_s9	Five of the tumor cell lines ( 31% ) expressed detectable levels of ER alpha and both of the immortalized cell lines showed a weak ER alpha expression level .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12140138_s10	All cell lines expressed the ER beta .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12140138_s11	The lung cell lines BEAS-2B and DB354 showed significantly reduced cell proliferation in response to tamoxifen and a minor increased growth in response to 17 beta-estradiol .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12140138_s12	In conclusion , ER genes are abundantly expressed in both histologically normal human lung and lung tumor cell lines .	
12140138_s13	This indicates a possible role of ERs in lung carcinogenesis .	
12142967_s0	The beneficial effect of yoghurt consumption on health and on the improvement of the mucosal immune system is well established , as is the diet-associated risk of colon cancer .	
12142967_s1	In an experimental model in BALB/c mice we demonstrated that yoghurt added to the diet for 10 consecutive days , with the procedure repeated each 10 days for 6 months , inhibited the development of a colorectal carcinoma induced by 1,2 dimethylhydrazine ( DMH ) .	
12142967_s2	The immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in the inhibition of tumour growth by yoghurt were also examined in these studies .	
12142967_s3	We determined B lymphocytes IgA(+) and IgG(+) , as well as CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the large intestine .	
12142967_s4	We measured cellular apoptosis and the cytokines TNF-alpha , IFN-gamma and IL-10 .	
12142967_s5	An increase in the number of IgA(+) ( P&lt;0.01 ) was observed , but not in IgG(+) ( P&lt;0.01 ) , or in the CD4(+) population ( P&lt;0.01 ) in the mice treated with DMH and yoghurt .	tumor promoting inflammation
12142967_s6	While in the group with the carcinogen there was an enhancement in the IgG(+) B cells ( P&lt;0.01 ) and CD8(+) T cells ( P&lt;0.01 ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
12142967_s7	Yoghurt increased the number of apoptotic cells and induced IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha cytokine release , their production being regulated by an increase in IL-10 ( P&lt;0.001 ) .	resisting cell death
12142967_s8	We demonstrated that yoghurt may exert antitumour activity by a decrease in the inflammatory immune response mediated by IgA(+) increase , apoptosis induction and IL-10 release .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
12151349_s0	Ovarian steroids are one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer .	
12151349_s1	Sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) binds and transports sex steroids in the blood , regulating their bioavailable fraction and access to target cells .	
12151349_s2	It can also inhibit the estradiol-induced proliferation of breast cancer cells through its membrane receptor .	
12151349_s3	Three coding-region polymorphisms , which lead to an amino acid change , have been reported .	
12151349_s4	We studied the influence of these three polymorphisms on breast cancer risk in three different populations : Polish familial breast cancer cases , 27% of them carrying a BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation , Nordic familial and sporadic breast cancer cases .	
12151349_s5	The reported G to A polymorphism in exon 1 was not found in the 423 analyzed samples .	
12151349_s6	Instead , we found a C to T transition causing an arg to cys amino acid change within the same codon in one Polish breast cancer patient and her daughter .	genomic instability and mutation
12151349_s7	Both of them were heterozygotes for the exon 8 G to A polymorphism as well .	
12151349_s8	They were diagnosed for bilateral breast cancer and carried a BRCA1 mutation ( 5382insC ) .	genomic instability and mutation
12151349_s9	Analysis of the tumor samples showed that they had lost the wild-type allele both at exons 1 and 8 of the SHBG gene .	
12151349_s10	Analysis of the other Polish samples showed no correlation of the exon 8 polymorphism to breast cancer , bilateral breast cancer , BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations or age at diagnosis .	genomic instability and mutation
12151349_s11	No association of the exon 8 polymorphism with breast cancer in the Nordic familial or sporadic cases was found .	
12151349_s12	The C to T polymorphism located in exon 4 was rare in all the studied populations ( overall allele frequency 0.011 ) .	
12151349_s13	However , in each of the study populations there was a trend for a lower variant allele frequency in cancer cases than in controls .	
12151349_s14	Variant allele frequency in all the breast cancer cases was significantly lower than in all the controls ( chi(2) = 5.27 , P-value 0.02 ; odds ratio = 0.23 , 95% confidence interval 0.05-0.84 ) .	
12171898_s0	PURPOSE Current antibody-based immunotherapeutic approaches under evaluation for breast carcinoma are limited in target scope .	
12171898_s1	For example , administration of the human epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) antibody , alone or in combination with a chemotherapeutic drug , is thought to primarily inhibit tumor cell proliferation .	
12171898_s2	The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a combined blockade designed to inhibit tumor growth by inhibition of proliferation rate and the proinflammatory effects of interleukin ( IL ) 8 .	
12171898_s3	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN A human breast carcinoma cell line that produces high levels of IL-8 was injected s.c. into severe combined immunodeficient mice .	
12171898_s4	IL-8 has been reported to augment the progression of some human tumors ; thus , we used a human IL-8 antibody , ABXIL8 , in combination with anti-EGFR , ABXEGFR , to inhibit the metastasis of MDA231 tumors .	
12171898_s5	RESULTS Whereas anti-IL-8 alone had no appreciable antimetastatic effect , the combination of ABXIL8 significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of ABXEGFR , resulting in greater survival of SCID tumor-bearing mice .	activating invasion and metastasis
12171898_s6	This effect on survival was correlated with decreased metastatic spread and decreased tumor size in mice receiving both antibodies .	activating invasion and metastasis
12171898_s7	Intriguingly , in vitro studies indicate that this antibody combination markedly inhibited matrix metalloproteinase activity associated with MDA-231 cells to a greater degree than either antibody alone .	
12171898_s8	CONCLUSION Combined administration of these two human antibodies using growth factor blockade in conjunction with chemokine blockade may thus provide a more effective approach for treatment of metastatic human breast carcinoma .	
12181065_s0	The HOX11 gene encodes a homeodomain transcription factor that is essential for spleen development during embryogenesis .	
12181065_s1	HOX11 is also leukaemogenic , both through its clinical association with childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , and its ability to immortalize other haematopoietic cell lineages experimentally .	
12181065_s2	To examine the pathological role of HOX11 in tumorigenesis , we constitutively expressed HOX11 cDNA in J2E murine erythroleukaemic cells , which are capable of terminal differentiation .	
12181065_s3	Enforced HOX11 expression was found to induce a profound alteration in J2E cellular morphology and differentiation status .	
12181065_s4	Our analyses revealed that HOX11 produced clones with a preponderance of less differentiated cells that were highly adherent to plastic .	
12181065_s5	Morphologically , the cells overexpressing HOX11 were larger and had decreased globin levels , as well as a reduction in haemoglobin synthesis in response to erythropoietin ( EPO ) .	
12181065_s6	Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed the immature erythroid phenotype imposed by HOX11 , with clones transfected with HOX11 demonstrating expression of the c-Kit stem cell marker , while retaining EPO receptor expression .	
12181065_s7	Taken together , these results show that HOX11 alters erythroid differentiation , favouring a less mature progenitor-like stage .	
12181065_s8	This supports the notion that disrupted haematopoietic cell differentiation is responsible for pre-leukaemic immortalization by the HOX11 oncoprotein .	enabling replicative immortality
12183074_s0	The aim of this study was to extend our previous observations on the soy modulation of biochemical parameters in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene ( DMBA)-induced rat mammary tumors , by simultaneously investigating the expression of estrogen receptor-alpha ( ERalpha ) , estrogen receptor-beta ( ERbeta ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , apoptosis , neu , and markers of cell proliferation , such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) by immunohistochemistry .	
12183074_s1	The percentage of ERalpha positive tumors was 65.8% in masses from control animals , and significantly dropped to 36.8% in tumors from soy treated rats ( P=0.010 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12183074_s2	The percentage of ERbeta positive tumors was 70.3% in masses from control animals vs. 50.0% in tumors from soy exposed animals ( P=0.066 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12183074_s3	Moreover , the percentage of cases which were both ERalpha and ERbeta positive was significantly lower ( 17.6% ) in soy treated than in control animals ( 51.3% ) ( P=0.006 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12183074_s4	The percentage of PR positive tumors was 34.2% in control animals vs. 2.6% in tumors from soy treated rats ( P=0.0006 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12183074_s5	There were no statistically significant differences in the percentage of tumors positively stained for neu , apoptosis , or PCNA , in control vs. soy treated rats .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
12183074_s6	However , when analyzing the reciprocal correlation among the different biochemical parameters we showed that , in treated animals , the majority of ERalpha positive tumors ( 91.7% ) were also PCNA positive ( P=0.036 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12183074_s7	The median percentage of PCNA positivity was significantly higher in ERalpha positive than in ERalpha negative tumors ( 25 vs. 5% ) ( P=0.0031 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12183074_s8	Moreover , an association was found between PCNA and neu status since all neu positive tumors were also PCNA positive ( P=0.011 ) .	
12183433_s0	The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that arise from mammary epithelial cells ( MECs ) .	
12183433_s1	One of the key early events in tumorigenic transformation is the ability of cells to overcome replicative senescence .	
12183433_s2	However , the precise genetic changes that are responsible for this event in MECs is largely unknown .	
12183433_s3	Here , we report that Bmi-1 , originally identified as a c-Myc cooperating oncoprotein , can bypass senescence , extend the replicative life span , and immortalize MECs .	enabling replicative immortality
12183433_s4	Furthermore , Bmi-1 was overexpressed in immortal MECs and several breast cancer cell lines .	
12183433_s5	Overexpression of Bmi-1 in MECs led to activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) transcription and induction of telomerase activity .	
12183433_s6	Telomerase induction by Bmi-1 was an early event in the extension of the replicative life span and immortalization .	enabling replicative immortality
12183433_s7	Bmi-1 was not overexpressed in hTERT-immortalized MECs , suggesting that Bmi-1 functions upstream of hTERT .	enabling replicative immortality
12183433_s8	Although , c-Myc has been reported to induce telomerase in MECs , Bmi-1 appeared to act independently of c-Myc binding sequences in the hTERT promoter .	
12183433_s9	Deletion analysis of the Bmi-1 protein suggested that the RING finger , as well as a conserved helix-turn-helix-turn domain , were required for its ability to induce telomerase and immortalize MECs .	enabling replicative immortality
12183433_s10	These data suggest that Bmi-1 regulates telomerase expression in MECs and plays a role in the development of human breast cancer .	
12192110_s0	Immunosuppression has been related to the incidence of tumor apparition , including endocrine tumors .	
12192110_s1	The intrasplenic ovarian tumor ( luteoma ) is a typical benign endocrine tumor that develops under high gonadotropin stimulation and , from the immunological perspective , is located in a critical organ involved in immune response .	
12192110_s2	To establish if immunosuppression could alter the development of this experimental tumor , the effects of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and dexamethasone ( Dex ) were evaluated .	
12192110_s3	After surgery , tumor-bearing and sham animals were kept without treatment for 4 weeks ; thereafter , they were distributed into CsA ( 25 mg/kg ) , Dex ( 0.1 mg/kg ) , or vehicle ( 75:25 castor oil:ethanol ) groups and were injected on alternate days for 50 days .	
12192110_s4	Body weight was evaluated weekly .	
12192110_s5	Animals were sacrificed after a jugular vein blood sample was obtained .	
12192110_s6	Thymi were weighed .	
12192110_s7	Tumors were measured and placed in formaline for histological studies .	
12192110_s8	Serum luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , prolactin ( PRL ) , and estradiol were measured by radioimmunoassay .	
12192110_s9	Hematological parameters were determined .	
12192110_s10	CsA induced a significant decrease in survival rates both in tumor-bearing and sham animals ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	
12192110_s11	Dex significantly impaired weight increase in both groups of animals .	
12192110_s12	CsA induced a significant weight loss in sham animals , not observed in tumor-bearing animals .	
12192110_s13	Dex induced thymus weight loss in both groups , whereas CsA induced thymus weight loss only in sham animals .	
12192110_s14	Only Dex induced a decrease in lymphocyte number in both groups .	
12192110_s15	CsA induced an increase in monocyte number only in sham animals .	
12192110_s16	Treatments did not alter LH , FSH , or estradiol , whereas PRL was increased by CsA only in sham rats .	
12192110_s17	Neither Dex nor CsA induced any significant variations in tumor volume , nor did they alter tumor histology .	
12192110_s18	In addition , no visible metastases or alterations in other organs were observed .	activating invasion and metastasis
12192110_s19	We conclude that , though immunological parameters were altered by the treatments , immunosuppressor drugs did not condition tumor development .	avoiding immune destruction
12192110_s20	In addition , tumors secrete one or more factor/s that counteract CsA effect .	
12195297_s0	The knowledge of alterations in regulation of autophagy during tumorigenesis may also help our understanding of its normal control .	
12195297_s1	We established an experimental system and reported recently that autophagic capacity , measured as the cell's capability of increasing segregation ( formation of autophagosomes ) and subsequent degradation of cytoplasmic quanta were highly increased in premalignant nodule cells 6 months after initiation by azaserine in the rat pancreas in vivo .	
12195297_s2	In the present study , we followed changes of these autophagic functions throughout the tumour progression .	
12195297_s3	We carried out electron-microscopic morphometrical analysis of the expansion of autophagic vacuole compartment and subcompartments induced by vinblastine ( an in vivo segregation enhancer ) , as well as their regression upon segregation-inhibitor cycloheximide post-treatment .	
12195297_s4	Premalignant tumour samples were taken at month 5 , month 8 ( nodules ) , month 10 and month 15 ( adenomas ) after initiation .	
12195297_s5	In all these stages , a highly increased and varying autophagic capacity was found compared with the host tissue .	resisting cell death
12195297_s6	The basal ( non-stimulated ) autophagic compartment was measurable only at month 5 and month 15 , and its regression upon cycloheximide was consistent with increased basal autophagic activity .	resisting cell death
12195297_s7	Compared with the host tissue , autophagic capacity profoundly decreased in the differentiated and anaplastic adenocarcinomas at month 20 , when , surprisingly , cycloheximide was unable to inhibit segregation .	resisting cell death
12195297_s8	Our conclusion is that down-regulation of the cycloheximide sensitive segregation and a partly compensatory up-regulation of an alternative pathway of segregation might occur along with malignant transformation .	
12202630_s0	Dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , a well-known differentiation inducer in several myeloid cells , also induces a reversible G(1) arrest in many cell lines .	
12202630_s1	We recently showed that DMSO induces a G(1) phase arrest in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells , by restoring contact inhibition and preventing high density-dependent apoptosis .	
12202630_s2	CHO cells are frequently used in cell biology and mutagenesis studies due to their good growth capacity and ease of manipulation but are very difficult to synchronize by serum starvation since they detach from monolayers when they reach confluence .	
12202630_s3	In this study we investigated the possibility of using DMSO to reversibly synchronize CHO cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and analysed whether toxic effects follow the arrest using growth curve , sister chromatid exchange and micronuclei assays .	
12202630_s4	We carried out a kinetic analysis of the arrest by DMSO and re-entry into the cell cycle after drug release by cytofluorimetric analysis of DNA content and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation .	
12202630_s5	We show that CHO cells are efficiently and reversibly arrested in G(1) by DMSO in concentrations ranging between 1 and 2% .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12202630_s6	In our experiments , &gt;90% of cells grown for 96 h in presence of the drug were arrested in G(1) and synchronously re-entered S phase approximately 8-12 h after release .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12202630_s7	Furthermore , expression levels of p27 were down-regulated during G(1) progression and cyclin D3 and E expression patterns were similar to those observed after serum starvation .	evading growth suppressors
12202630_s8	No detectable cytotoxicity or genetic damage were induced in G(1) released cells as revealed by the tests employed .	
12202630_s9	Our results show that DMSO is a very powerful inducer of G(1) synchronization in CHO cells without detectable cytotoxic or genetic effects in cell populations released from G(1) arrest .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12202630_s10	DMSO synchronization represents a model system in which to analyse protein activities regulating G(1) progression and investigate the response of G(1) cells to mutagen treatments .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
12202919_s0	The widespread use of synthetic musk fragrances and the resultant presence of these substances and their metabolites in the aquatic environment ( as well as their accumulation in human adipose tissue ) raises the question of whether musk fragrances display endocrine and in particular estrogenic activity .	
12202919_s1	A variety of musk fragrances were tested using the E-screen assay .	
12202919_s2	A statistically significant increase in proliferation rate of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells was detected for two nitro musks ( musk xylene , musk ketone ) , a major metabolite of musk xylene ( p-amino-musk xylene ) , and the polycyclic musk fragrance AHTN .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12202919_s3	This indicates that these substances do , in fact , demonstrate estrogenic activity .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12202919_s4	Coincubation with the antiestrogen tamoxifen showed that the increase in proliferation rate by the musk fragrances is estrogen receptor-mediated .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12202919_s5	It must be noted , however , that the effective estrogenic strength and estrogenic potency were low compared to 17 b-estradiol .	
12202919_s6	The naturally occurring fragrance muscone from the group of macrocyclic musk fragrances , a group of substances that have not yet been well characterized in respect to their toxicological properties , has also been shown to be weakly estrogenically active in vitro .	
12202919_s7	E-screen analysis showed that the nitro musk metabolites o-amino musk xylene and 2-amino-MK , the macrocyclic musk fragrances ethylene brassylate , ethylene dodecandioate , and cyclopentadecanolide , are not estrogenically active .	
12203111_s0	Mutations in the Nf2 tumor suppressor gene lead to tumor formation in humans and mice and cellular overproliferation phenotypes in Drosophila .	
12203111_s1	The Nf2 encoded protein , merlin , shares close sequence similarity in its amino terminus to members of the band 4.1 family of membrane-cytoskeletal linkers .	
12203111_s2	Similarities between merlin and this family suggest a role for merlin in regulating cytoskeletal function .	
12203111_s3	However , the mechanism of the tumor suppressing activity of merlin is not yet understood .	
12203111_s4	Mutational analysis of Nf2 in flies has led to the identification of a dominant-negative allele , which harbors mutations in the amino terminus of the protein .	
12203111_s5	Here , we report that expression of a murine analog of this amino-terminal mutant of Nf2 leads to complete transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in culture .	genomic instability and mutation
12203111_s6	Cells that express this Nf2 mutant allele display disruptions of the actin cytoskeleton , lack of contact inhibition of growth , and anchorage-independent growth .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
12203111_s7	Finally , fibroblasts that express this mutant Nf2 allele form tumors when injected into nude mice .	
12204665_s0	p107 Links to cyclin A/CDK2 ( cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ) and cyclin E/CDK2 that are important cell cycle regulators .	
12204665_s1	However , p107 expression remains unclear in almost all kinds of human solid tumours .	
12204665_s2	To clarify the expression of p107 in colorectal tumours , 22 normal mucosae , 9 hyperplastic polyps , 60 adenomas , 198 primary carcinomas , 21 lymph-nodal metastases , and 10 hepatic metastases were immunohistochemically stained for p107 , cyclin A , cyclin E , CDK2 and Ki67 .	
12204665_s3	Results were measured using labelling indices ( LIs). p107 LIs surpassed the highest value in normal tissues in six of nine hyperplastic polyps , 54 of 60 adenomas , 144 of 198 primary cancers , 13 of 21 nodal foci and three of 10 hepatic foci. p107 LIs also apparently rose from normal through hyperplasia and adenoma to early carcinoma .	
12204665_s4	However , they declined in liver-metastatic foci , and in primary cancers showing large size , mucinous type , venous invasion , lymphatic invasion , poorly differentiated type , deep invasion , lymph-nodal metastasis , hepatic metastasis or advanced stage .	activating invasion and metastasis
12204665_s5	Low p107 LIs were also linked to a poor survival , particularly in stage-III patients .	
12204665_s6	As the p107 LI gradually rose , the CDK2 ( in primary cancers only ) , cyclin A , cyclin E and Ki67 LIs were elevated concurrently-in both adenomas and primary cancers .	
12204665_s7	Thus , in colorectal tumours , p107 expression rises abnormally and gradually during carcinogenesis and then falls during invasion , and thereby probably perturbs the cell-cycle control and promotes carcinogenesis and invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
12204665_s8	Clinically , reduced p107 may indicate a poorer prognosis .	
12208764_s0	Cellular senescence , initially observed during subculturing of normal diploid fibroblasts , can also be induced by chronic exposure to cellular stress , such as UV light , oxidative stress , or DNA damaging agents .	
12208764_s1	Here we demonstrate that stable expression of an activated form of MKK6 ( MKK6EE ) , a direct activator of the stress-induced p38(HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway , is sufficient for inducing features of senescence including a flattened , vacuolated , and irregular morphology , staining for acidic beta-galactosidase , and accumulation of age-associated pigments .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
12208764_s2	Consistent with the senescent phenotype , p38(HOG) activation induces a G(1) cell cycle arrest , which is permanent and irreversible after 4 days .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
12208764_s3	MKK6EE also induces biochemical features of senescence in a p38-dependent manner , including enhanced expression of p21(CIP) , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor .	enabling replicative immortality
12208764_s4	Microarray analysis of MKK6EE cells showed a pattern of gene expression noted previously in Werner Syndrome and senescent fibroblasts .	enabling replicative immortality
12208764_s5	These results define p38(HOG) as an intracellular pathway that activates a senescence checkpoint in tumor cells and may play a role in Ras- or stress-induced senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
12209878_s0	Malignant mesothelioma ( MM ) still remains a therapeutic and diagnostic problem to which new therapeutic perspectives are being continuously tried and tested .	
12209878_s1	Three different primary cultures ( MMGe-1 , MES MM 98 , and MES 1 ) and one immortalized cell line ( MSTO 211 H ) of human MM were studied in order to evaluate the HER-2/neu expression .	
12209878_s2	Three out of four cell lines showed a different level of c-erbB-2 expression , the highest being detected on the MSTO 211 H cell line ( fibroblastic phenotype ) , whereas MMGe-1 resulted negative .	
12209878_s3	The effect of the anti-HER-2/neu antibody ( Trastuzumab ) alone , and in combination with cisplatin ( CDDP ) at different doses ( ranging from 0.1 to 100 microg/ml ) , was studied on all the c-erB-2 positive cell lines .	
12209878_s4	Trastuzumab was able to inhibit cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner , with growth inhibition also obtained at low concentrations ( 0.1-1 microg/ml ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12209878_s5	Combined treatment with Trastuzumab ( 10 microg/ml ) and CDDP ( 1 microg/ml ) showed synergism .	
12209878_s6	Our results were encouraging , and suggest a rationale for further investigations in a clinical setting .	
12218188_s0	PD-1 is a receptor of the Ig superfamily that negatively regulates T cell antigen receptor signaling by interacting with the specific ligands ( PD-L ) and is suggested to play a role in the maintenance of self-tolerance .	
12218188_s1	In the present study , we examined possible roles of the PD-1/PD-L system in tumor immunity .	
12218188_s2	Transgenic expression of PD-L1 , one of the PD-L , in P815 tumor cells rendered them less susceptible to the specific T cell antigen receptor-mediated lysis by cytotoxic T cells in vitro , and markedly enhanced their tumorigenesis and invasiveness in vivo in the syngeneic hosts as compared with the parental tumor cells that lacked endogenous PD-L .	
12218188_s3	Both effects could be reversed by anti-PD-L1 Ab .	
12218188_s4	Survey of murine tumor lines revealed that all of the myeloma cell lines examined naturally expressed PD-L1 .	
12218188_s5	Growth of the myeloma cells in normal syngeneic mice was inhibited significantly albeit transiently by the administration of anti-PD-L1 Ab in vivo and was suppressed completely in the syngeneic PD-1-deficient mice .	
12218188_s6	These results suggest that the expression of PD-L1 can serve as a potent mechanism for potentially immunogenic tumors to escape from host immune responses and that blockade of interaction between PD-1 and PD-L may provide a promising strategy for specific tumor immunotherapy .	avoiding immune destruction
12219835_s0	The metastatic spread of malignant neoplasms is associated with active migration of cancer cells .	
12219835_s1	The migration of neoplastic cells during the metastatic process may be affected by various extracellular factors , including chemoattractants , haptotactic signals , electric fields , substrate anisotropy , and cell-to-cell contacts .	
12219835_s2	We examined the effect of homotypic collisions and heterotypic interactions with normal human skin fibroblasts on the motile activity of Walker carcinosarcoma cells .	
12219835_s3	It was found that Walker carcinosarcoma cells moving in a dense population neither show contact inhibition of movement when colliding with one another nor increase their motile activity as a result of contact stimulation of motility .	evading growth suppressors
12219835_s4	On the other hand , when plated onto the surface of aligned fibroblasts , Walker carcinosarcoma cells migrated mainly along the long axes of underlying fibroblasts as a result of contact guidance .	
12219835_s5	The directional character of movement ( but not the speed of migration ) of Walker carcinosarcoma cells on the surface of aligned fibroblasts was completely effaced by RGD-containing synthetic peptide at a concentration of 1 mg/ml but not by 5 microM verapamil ( selective voltage-gated calcium channel inhibitor ) or 10 microM gadolinium chloride ( non-specific blocker of mechanosensitive ion channels ) .	
12219835_s6	The suppression of directional character of migration of tumour cells by RGD-containing peptide was associated with the decrease in the amount of fibronectin macromolecules attached to fibroblasts .	
12219835_s7	This suggests that alignment and anisotropic distribution of fibronectin macromolecules may be responsible for contact guidance of tumour cells moving on the surface of fibroblasts .	
12220644_s0	The G protein-coupled human gastrin-releasing peptide receptor ( hGRP-R ) is frequently found aberrantly expressed in human cancers of the colon , stomach , and lung , and its ligand-specific activation has been implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation .	
12220644_s1	Here , we demonstrated hGRP-R activation stimulated sustained cyclic AMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) phosphorylation and transactivation in duodenal cancer cells through a protein kinase C and partially p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12220644_s2	In contrast , intracellular calcium , ERK1/2 , protein kinase A , and PI3 kinase were not involved .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12220644_s3	This novel signaling mechanism might be of importance for regulation of CREB-dependent gene expression in human cancer expressing functional hGRP-R .	
12220727_s0	A rat colonic adenocarcinoma was implanted subcutaneously ( s.c. ) in nude mice .	
12220727_s1	After 7 days , the animals were divided into different groups .	
12220727_s2	Two groups received subcutaneous injections twice daily with 3 or 6 micro g/kg body weight octreotide , galanin and serotonin .	
12220727_s3	Three groups were respectively treated with 20 , 30 , and 40 micro g/kg body weight of the previously mentioned bioactive substances .	
12220727_s4	Control group received only saline solution in the same fashion as treated animals .	
12220727_s5	The treatment lasted for 5 days .	
12220727_s6	The tumour volume and weight , the relative density of blood vessels , of tumour necrotic tissue , of apoptotic nuclei and of proliferating nuclei were measured .	
12220727_s7	Apoptosis was detected by in situ labelling of nuclear DNA fragmentation according to TUNEL method , and proliferation by immunocytochemistry .	resisting cell death
12220727_s8	Morphometry was done with the classical stereological point-counting method .	
12220727_s9	Food consumption , animal weight , faeces weight and its water content were measured for 3 days before and after treatment .	
12220727_s10	Triple therapy with 3 and 6 micro g/kg body weight had no effect on any of the parameters measured , except in reducing the relative volume density of tumour blood vessels .	inducing angiogenesis
12220727_s11	Treatment with 20 , 30 and 40 micro g/kg body weight of the previously mentioned bioactive substances reduced the tumour volume , the relative volume density of blood vessels and increased the relative volume density of necrotic tissue and of apoptotic nuclei ( in the 20 micro g group ) .	resisting cell death
12220727_s12	However , there was no difference between treated mice and controls regarding the relative volume density of proliferating nuclei .	
12220727_s13	There was no statistical difference between treated animals regarding food consumption , body weight , faeces weight and its water content before and during treatment .	
12220727_s14	The present study confirms that triple therapy with octreotide , galanin and serotonin causes regression of a rat colon carcinoma .	
12220727_s15	It further showed that optimum treatment dose is 20 micro g/kg body weight of each bioactive substance .	
12220727_s16	Moreover , this therapy regime does not show apparent side effects in the experiments carried out on mice .	
12231192_s0	Exposure to ultraviolet B ( UVB ) radiation ( 280-320 nm ) is the primary etiologic factor associated with the development of basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) .	
12231192_s1	The outgrowth of these keratinocyte-derived skin lesions is enhanced by the ability of UVB to impair an immune response that would otherwise eliminate them .	
12231192_s2	Studies in a range of inbred mouse strains as well as mast cell-depleted mice reconstituted with mast cell precursors support a functional link between histamine-staining dermal mast cells and the extent of susceptibility to UVB-induced systemic immunomodulation .	
12231192_s3	Humans , like mouse strains , display variations in dermal mast cell prevalence .	
12231192_s4	In a study of Danish and South Australian BCC patients and control subjects , one 4-mm punch biopsy of non-sun-exposed buttock skin was sampled from each participant .	
12231192_s5	This skin site was investigated to avoid any changes in mast cell prevalence caused by sun exposure .	
12231192_s6	Two sections ( 4 microm ) per biopsy were immunohistochemically stained for detection of histamine-containing dermal mast cells .	
12231192_s7	Computer-generated image analysis evaluated dermal mast cell prevalence in both sections by quantifying the total number of mast cells according to the total dermal area ( expressed as mast cells per square millimeter ) .	
12231192_s8	This technique enabled us to detect heterogeneity of dermal mast cell prevalence in buttock skin between individuals and provided evidence of an association between high dermal mast cell prevalence and BCC development in two diverse populations .	
12231192_s9	We hypothesize that mast cells function in humans , as in mouse strains , by initiating immunosuppression following UV irradiation and , thereby , allowing a permissive environment for the development of BCC .	avoiding immune destruction
12231192_s10	Thus , a high dermal mast cell prevalence as demonstrable in buttock skin is a significant predisposing factor for development of BCC in humans .	
12234411_s0	OBJECTIVE Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) secondary to EGFR gene amplification is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and a worse clinical outcome .	
12234411_s1	The purpose of this study was to analyze whether blocking this receptor with the anti-EGFR chimeric monoclonal antibody C225 would decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis in GBM cells .	
12234411_s2	METHODS EGFR expression and amplification were analyzed for seven human GBM cell lines .	
12234411_s3	These lines were then exposed to different concentrations of C225 for 48 hours , 72 hours , and 7 days , after which time cytotoxicity , apoptosis , and vascular endothelial growth factor expression were assessed in vitro .	
12234411_s4	Two EGFR-amplified human GBM were implanted in the flanks of nude mice , and the animals received C225 twice per week intraperitoneally for 5 weeks .	
12234411_s5	Tumor volumes and survival times were compared with those of sham-treated mice .	
12234411_s6	RESULTS EGFR gene amplification was demonstrated in three of the primary GBM lines .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12234411_s7	C225 treatment produced significant cytotoxicity in all three EGFR-amplified GBM lines , but not in unamplified lines .	
12234411_s8	Flow cytometry demonstrated increased apoptosis in C225-treated , EGFR-amplified GBM lines , but not in unamplified lines .	resisting cell death
12234411_s9	There was a decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor expression in all GBM lines with exposure to C225 .	inducing angiogenesis
12234411_s10	Tumor-bearing mice treated with C225 experienced significant inhibition of tumor growth as well as a 200% increase in median survival .	
12234411_s11	CONCLUSION Blocking EGFR in GBM cells that overexpress this receptor significantly changes tumor cell biology by promoting apoptosis while decreasing proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor expression .	
12234411_s12	This approach holds great promise for the treatment of patients with GBMs .	
12242083_s0	Glycolysis is known to be the primary energy source in most cancer cells .	
12242083_s1	We investigated here the effect of clotrimazole ( 1-(alpha-2-chlorotrityl)imidazole ) , the antifungal azole derivative , which was recently recognized as calmodulin antagonist , on the levels of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate , the two stimulatory signal molecules of glycolysis , and on ATP content and cell viability in LL/2 Lewis lung carcinoma cells and CT-26 colon adenocarcinoma cells .	
12242083_s2	We found that clotrimazole induced a significant , dose- and time-dependent reduction in the levels of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate , fructose 1,6-bisphosphate , ATP , and cell viability .	cellular energetics
12242083_s3	These findings suggest that clotrimazole causes a reduction in glycolysis and ATP levels , which eventually leads to cell destruction after 3 h of treatment .	
12242083_s4	Since cell proliferation was also reported to be inhibited by calmodulin antagonists , this substance is most promising agent in treatment of cancer by inhibiting both cell proliferation and the glycolytic supply of ATP required for cancer cell growth .	
12244187_s0	The immune system of vertebrates is able to detect bacterial DNA based on the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs .	
12244187_s1	We examined the therapeutic potential of oligodeoxynucleotides with CpG motifs ( CpG ODN ) in a colon carcinoma model in BALB/c mice .	
12244187_s2	Tumors were induced by s.c. injection of syngeneic C26 cells or Renca kidney cancer cells as a control .	
12244187_s3	Injection of CpG ODN alone or in combination with irradiated tumor cells did not protect mice against subsequent tumor challenge .	
12244187_s4	In contrast , weekly injections of CpG ODN into the margin of already established tumors resulted in regression of tumors and complete cure of mice .	
12244187_s5	The injection site was critical , since injection of CpG ODN at distant sites was not effective .	
12244187_s6	Mice with two bilateral C26 tumors rejected both tumors upon peritumoral injection of one tumor , indicating the development of a systemic immune response .	avoiding immune destruction
12244187_s7	The tumor specificity of the immune response was demonstrated in mice bearing a C26 tumor and a Renca tumor at the same time .	avoiding immune destruction
12244187_s8	Mice that rejected a tumor upon peritumoral CpG treatment remained tumor free and were protected against rechallenge with the same tumor cells , but not with the other tumor , demonstrating long term memory .	
12244187_s9	Tumor-specific CD8 T cells as well as innate effector cells contributed to the antitumor activity of treatment .	avoiding immune destruction
12244187_s10	In conclusion , peritumoral CpG ODN monotherapy elicits a strong CD8 T cell response and innate effector mechanisms that seem to act in concert to overcome unresponsiveness of the immune system toward a growing tumor .	avoiding immune destruction
12355140_s0	It is still difficult to decide on the treatment modalities for advanced esophageal carcinoma when the prognostic factors of T4 esophageal cancer are not fully understood .	
12355140_s1	In this article , we report that among 71 patients with T4 thoracic esophageal cancer , 49 underwent esophagectomy , 9 had curative resection ( R0 group ) , and 40 had palliative resection ( R1/2 group ) .	
12355140_s2	A total of 22 patients had palliative treatments : bypass in 5 ( bypass group ) , gastrostomy or jejunostomy in 6 ( stoma group ) , and radiochemotherapy alone in 11 ( nonoperation group ) .	
12355140_s3	Clinicopathologic characteristics were retrospectively investigated .	
12355140_s4	Treatment-related deaths occurred in 7 ( 10% ) : none in R0 , 3 ( 8% ) in R1/2 , 3 ( 60% ) in bypass , and 1 ( 17% ) in stoma group .	
12355140_s5	Swallowing was improved in 50 ( 70% ) patients : 9 ( 100% ) in R0 , 30 ( 75% ) in R1/2 , 1 ( 20% ) in bypass , 3 ( 50% ) in stoma , and 7 ( 64% ) in the nonoperation group .	
12355140_s6	One- , two- , and three-year overall survival rates were 56% , 22% , and 22% in the R0 group and 35% , 19% and 6% in the R1/2 group , respectively ( p = 0.19 ) .	
12355140_s7	In the bypass , stoma , and nonoperation groups , none survived 1.6 years .	activating invasion and metastasis
12355140_s8	The factors influencing the survival rate of the 49 patients undergoing esophagectomy were grade of lymph node metastasis , amount of perioperative blood transfusion , lymph vessel , and blood vessel invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
12355140_s9	Among these , independent prognostic factors for survival were amount of blood transfusion ( -6 units vs. -7 units , p &lt;0.0001 ) and grade of lymph node metastasis [ none- or peritumoral [ lymph nodes adjacent to the main tumor or at a nearby location ( &lt;3 cm ) from the tumor ] metastasis vs. more distant metastasis [ lymph nodes at a distant location ( &gt ; 3 cm) ] , p = 0.016 ] .	activating invasion and metastasis
12355140_s10	Bypass and stoma operation neither prolonged the survival nor improved the difficulty of swallowing compared with radiochemotherapy alone .	
12355140_s11	Esophagectomy can achieve the best improvement of swallowing and the longest survival with an acceptable mortality rate .	
12355140_s12	Esophageal carcinoma patients with T4 disease and distinct metastasis in the lymph nodes at a distant location ( &gt;3 cm ) from the primary tumor may not benefit from an esophageal resection .	activating invasion and metastasis
12357429_s0	A key issue in the development of the central nervous system ( CNS ) is understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating cell number .	
12357429_s1	The present study examines the role of CD81 ( previously known as TAPA , the target of the antiproliferative antibody ) in the control of brain size and glial cell number .	
12357429_s2	CD81 is a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins .	
12357429_s3	This group of small membrane proteins is associated with the regulation of cell migration and mitotic activity .	
12357429_s4	Glial cells express CD81 , and antibodies directed against this protein suppress the mitotic activity of cultured cells .	
12357429_s5	In this study , we examine the effects of the CD81 -/- mutation on the CNS of mature mice .	
12357429_s6	These mice have extremely large brains , as much as 30% larger than the brains of wild-type ( +/+ ) littermates .	
12357429_s7	The increase in brain weight is accompanied by an increase in the number astrocytes and microglia , whereas the number of neurons and oligodendrocytes in the CD81 -/- animals appears to be normal .	
12357429_s8	When the CD81 -/- mutation is placed on different genetic backgrounds , there is a remarkable range in the penetrance of the null allele phenotype , demonstrating that the mutation can be affected by modifier loci .	genomic instability and mutation
12357429_s9	This work provides support for the role of CD81 in the regulation of astrocyte and microglial number , perhaps by regulating cell proliferation by a contact inhibition-dependent mechanism .	evading growth suppressors
12359748_s0	We used cDNA-based genomic microarrays to examine DNA copy number changes in a panel of prostate tumors and found a previously undescribed amplicon on chromosome 17 containing a novel overexpressed gene that we termed prostate cancer gene 17 ( PRC17 ) .	
12359748_s1	When overexpressed in 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells , PRC17 induced growth in low serum , loss of contact inhibition , and tumor formation in nude mice .	evading growth suppressors
12359748_s2	The PRC17 gene product contains a GTPase-activating protein ( GAP ) catalytic core motif found in various Rab/Ypt GAPs , including RN-Tre .	
12359748_s3	Similar to RN-Tre , we found that PRC17 protein interacts directly with Rab5 and stimulates its GTP hydrolysis .	
12359748_s4	Point mutations that alter conserved amino acid residues within the PRC17 GAP domain abolished its transforming abilities , suggesting that GAP activity is essential for its oncogenic function .	genomic instability and mutation
12359748_s5	Whereas PRC17 is amplified in 15% of prostate cancers , it is highly overexpressed in approximately one-half of metastatic prostate tumors .	activating invasion and metastasis
12359748_s6	The potent oncogenic activity of PRC17 is likely to influence the tumorigenic phenotype of these prostate cancers .	
12359757_s0	Hormone-independent tumor growth and metastasis are associated with increased mortality in human prostate cancer .	
12359757_s1	In this study , we evaluate a potential role for ligand-mediated activation of HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase in androgen-independent prostate cancers .	
12359757_s2	HER2 , HER3 , and epidermal growth factor receptor were detected in the androgen-independent cell line 22Rv1 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12359757_s3	Heregulin stimulation results in receptor phosphorylation and cell proliferation that is inhibited by increasing concentrations of anti-HER2 recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody ( rhuMAb ) 2C4 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12359757_s4	Furthermore , inhibition of tumor growth was observed in xenografts derived from 22Rv1 cells when treated with rhuMAb 2C4 in a dose-dependent manner .	
12359757_s5	These studies provide a framework , both in vitro and in vivo , to examine the molecular mechanisms of ligand-driven HER2 activation in androgen-independent tumorigenesis .	
12366810_s0	We have previously reported the frequent occurrence of bile duct invasion by liver metastases from colorectal cancer .	
12366810_s1	We found that patients with macroscopic intrabiliary cancer growth survive longer after hepatectomy than those without this feature .	
12366810_s2	In the present study , we analyzed the clinicopathological features of primary colorectal cancer showing macroscopic intrabiliary extension of liver metastases .	
12366810_s3	We reviewed 217 patients who underwent initial hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastasis between 1992 and 1998 , and analyzed the corresponding primary colorectal cancers clinicopathologically .	
12366810_s4	Microscopic bile duct invasion was found in 89 of 217 cases ( 40.6% ) and , of these cases , 23 ( 10.6% ) had macroscopic intrabiliary extension .	activating invasion and metastasis
12366810_s5	Histological sections of the corresponding primary colorectal cancer were available in eight ( group A ) of these 23 cases .	
12366810_s6	These were compared with 20 cases , selected randomly , of colorectal cancer that did not show bile duct invasion and were diagnosed as liver metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
12366810_s7	These patients underwent hepatectomy during the same period as group A and were used as a control ( group B ) .	
12366810_s8	The histology of the primary tumors revealed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in 100% of group A and in 25% of group B. The average maximum diameter of the primary tumor was 5.32 cm in group A and 3.61 cm in group B. Venous invasion was detected in 25% of group A and in 90% of group B ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) , while the incidences of lymphatic vessel invasion and lymph node metastases were similar between the groups .	
12366810_s9	These data suggest that macroscopic intrabiliary extension could be a good indicator of a unique subgroup of colorectal cancers showing less aggressive features even though they develop liver metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
12366810_s10	Careful histological evaluation is important even for metastatic tumors .	activating invasion and metastasis
12368953_s0	Antithymocyte globulin is widely used before haematopoietic transplantation with HLA-matched unrelated donors or mismatched relatives to prevent rejection and graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) .	
12368953_s1	However , optimal dosage is still under debate .	
12368953_s2	Thirty-one consecutive children , mainly with haematological malignancies , were transplanted in a single institution with such donors , selected by HLA-A -B compatibility by serology and DRB1* by DNA typing .	
12368953_s3	Antithymocyte globulin ( Thymoglobuline ; Sangstat ) was infused at days -3 , -2 , -1 .	
12368953_s4	Total dosage varied : 16 patients received a median of 7.5 mg/kg ( 2.5 to 10.5 : low-dose group ) , and 15 a median of 15.5 mg/kg ( 14.4 to 19.4 : high-dose group ) .	
12368953_s5	Post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine , short-course methotrexate and steroids .	
12368953_s6	CD3(+) , CD4(+) and CD19(+) cell reconstitution was slower in the high-dose group .	avoiding immune destruction
12368953_s7	Median time to reach 100 CD4(+) cells was 8 months vs 4 months ( P = 0.03 ) .	
12368953_s8	Median time to normal CD19(+) cells was 16 months vs 8 months ( P = 0.01 ) .	
12368953_s9	CD16(+)CD56(+) and CD8(+) cell reconstitution was similar .	
12368953_s10	Nine patients in the high-dose group and two in the low-dose group experienced life-threatening opportunistic infections ( P = 0.009 ) .	
12368953_s11	Although obtained from a limited number of patients , our data suggest that a higher pre-graft dose of antithymocyte globulin may negatively influence immune reconstitution .	
12370286_s0	Human fibroblasts undergo cellular senescence after a finite number of divisions , in response to the erosion of telomeres .	
12370286_s1	In addition to being terminally arrested in the cell cycle , senescent fibroblasts express genes that are normally induced upon wounding , including genes that remodel the extracellular matrix .	
12370286_s2	We have identified the novel zinc finger protein APA-1 , whose expression increased in senescent human fibroblasts independent of telomere shortening .	
12370286_s3	Extended passage , telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts had increased levels of APA-1 as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 .	
12370286_s4	In fibroblasts , APA-1 was modified by the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1 , which increased APA-1 half-life , possibly by blocking ubiquitin-mediated degradation .	
12370286_s5	Overexpression of APA-1 did not cause cell cycle arrest ; but , it induced transcription of the extracellular matrix-remodeling genes MMP1 and PAI2 , which are associated with fibroblast senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
12370286_s6	MMP1 and PAI2 transcript levels also increased in telomerase-immortalized fibroblasts that had high levels of APA-1 , demonstrating that the matrix-remodeling phenotype of senescent fibroblasts was not induced by telomere attrition alone .	enabling replicative immortality
12370286_s7	APA-1 was able to transactivate and bind to the MMP1 promoter , suggesting that APA-1 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of matrix-remodeling genes during fibroblast senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
12373297_s0	Telomerase activity , a cardinal requirement for immortalization , is a crucial step in the development of cancer and has been studied in many kinds of malignant tumours for clinical diagnostic and/or prognostic utilities .	
12373297_s1	Using a PCR-based TRAP assay , we investigated telomerase activity in 8 adenomatous polyps , 9 dysplastic polyps , and in 36 paired cancer-normal mucosa specimens , one liver and one spleen metastasis from patients resected for sporadic colorectal cancer .	
12373297_s2	Telomerase was absent or very low in normal mucosa and in adenomatous polyps .	
12373297_s3	Dysplastic polyps and adenocarcinoma samples showed telomerase activity , with higher levels in cancer tissues compared to dysplastic lesions .	
12373297_s4	A high telomerase activity was shown to be associated with late-staged cancers and metastasis , providing arguments supporting the role of telomerase not only in the development but also in the progression of colorectal carcinoma .	activating invasion and metastasis
12373297_s5	Moreover , telomerase evaluation may help to confirm the malignant transformation in polypoid colorectal lesions with different levels of dysplastic alterations .	
12373308_s0	To search for potential biomarkers used to monitor the process of immortalization , we investigated the relative level of telomerase activity and other immortal phenotypes in the SHEE esophageal epithelial cell line .	
12373308_s1	This human fetal esophageal epithelial cell line , induced by human papilloma virus ( HPV ) 18 E6E7 , was continually propagated over 100 passages .	
12373308_s2	Fourteenth passage cells ( SHEE14 ) were cultured in a flask with a serum-free medium and continually cultured to the 30th passage ( SHEE30 ) .	
12373308_s3	Cells of SHEE14 , SHEE20 and SHEE30 were examined according to cell morphology , cell cycle , apoptosis , contact-inhibition growth , anchorage- dependency , dose-dependency to epithelial growth factors ( EGF ) , telomerase activity and tumorigenicity .	
12373308_s4	The SHEE14 cells exhibited good differentiation with contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth .	evading growth suppressors
12373308_s5	The SHEE20 cells exhibited increase of senescent and apoptotic cells , and difficulty in propagation .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
12373308_s6	The SHEE30 cells exhibited a higher proliferative index and some undifferentiated cells , with weakened contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth .	evading growth suppressors
12373308_s7	The telomerase was activated in cells of SHEE30 , but not in SHEE14 and SHEE20 cells .	
12373308_s8	The different response to dose-dependency to EGF was not statistically different in SHEE14 and SHEE30 .	
12373308_s9	Three groups of cells displayed lack of tumor formation in nude mice .	
12373308_s10	Compared with SHEE14 and SHEE20 , SHEE30 cells were of immortalized status with immortal phenotype , which consisted of telomerase activity , increase of cell proliferation , weakened contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth , dose dependency to EGF and lack of tumor formation .	enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors
12373308_s11	From passage 14 to 30th passage , SHEE cells went through cellular senescence , apoptosis and immortalization .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death

12376465_s0	Nur77 is an orphan receptor .	
12376465_s1	Although Nur77 affects cell proliferation and apoptosis through its capability of binding to a variety of response elements and regulating their transactivation activities , the intrinsic function of Nur77 is not yet fully understood ; in particular , its regulation of apoptosis and proliferation has been characterized as cell type-dependent and agent context-dependent .	
12376465_s2	In this study , Nur77 can be seen to regulate apoptosis via its expression and translocation , rather than its transactivation activity in gastric cancer cells .	resisting cell death
12376465_s3	Nur77 was constitutively expressed in BGC-823 cells .	
12376465_s4	The tetradecanoylphorbol-1,3-acetate ( TPA ) treatment not only resulted in up-regulation of the Nur77 mRNA level , but also led to translocation of Nur77 protein from the nucleus to the mitochondria , and caused the release of cytochrome c .	
12376465_s5	This TPA-induced translocation of Nur77 was in association with the initiation of apoptosis in gastric cancer cells .	resisting cell death
12376465_s6	Although all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) could not induce apoptosis in BGC-823 cells due to failure of stimulating Nur77 translocation , expression of Nur77 in the nucleus was required for cell growth inhibition by ATRA .	resisting cell death
12376465_s7	Transfection of antisense Nur77 receptor into BGC-823 cells resulted in resistance of cell growth against ATRA inhibition , and the cells were still arrested in the S phase .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12376465_s8	Furthermore , the action of Nur77 in TPA-induced apoptosis was mediated through a protein kinase C signaling pathway , while mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways were responsible for the regulation of Nur77 mRNA expression .	resisting cell death
12376465_s9	Taken together , the data revealed the dual functioning mechanisms of Nur77 in gastric cancer cells in response to TPA and ATRA .	
12383904_s0	BACKGROUND Intracystic papillary carcinoma ( IPC ) of the breast is a rare form of noninvasive breast cancer .	
12383904_s1	An appreciation of associated pathology with IPC may be critical in surgical decision-making .	
12383904_s2	METHODS The medical records of all patients with IPC treated between 1985 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed .	
12383904_s3	Three patient groups were identified according to the pathologic features of the primary tumor : IPC alone , IPC with associated ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) , and IPC with associated invasion with or without DCIS .	
12383904_s4	Types of treatment and outcomes were compared between groups .	
12383904_s5	RESULTS Forty patients were treated for IPC during the study period .	
12383904_s6	Fourteen had pure IPC , 13 had IPC with DCIS , and 13 had IPC with invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
12383904_s7	The incidence of recurrence and the likelihood of dying of IPC did not differ between the three groups regardless of the type of surgery ( mastectomy or segmental mastectomy ) performed and whether radiation therapy was administered .	
12383904_s8	The disease-specific survival rate was 100% .	
12383904_s9	CONCLUSIONS When IPC is identified , it is frequently associated with DCIS and or invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
12383904_s10	Standard therapy should be based on associated pathology .	
12383904_s11	The role of radiation therapy in pure IPC remains to be determined .	
12385002_s0	Retinoic acid ( RA ) and its derivatives inhibit the proliferation of normal human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) and some breast carcinoma lines by mechanisms which are not fully understood .	
12385002_s1	To identify genes that mediate RA-induced cell growth arrest , an HMEC cDNA library was synthesized and subtractive screening was performed .	
12385002_s2	We identified the interleukin-1beta ( IL-1beta ) gene as an RA induced gene in HMEC .	
12385002_s3	Northern blot analyses showed that the IL-1beta gene was up-regulated as early as 2 h after RA treatment .	
12385002_s4	Results from the treatment of HMEC with cycloheximide and actinomycin D indicated that the regulation of the IL-1beta gene by RA occurred at the transcriptional level and that the IL-1beta gene is a direct , downstream target gene of RA .	
12385002_s5	To evaluate the effects of IL-1beta on cell proliferation , the proliferation of HMEC was measured in the presence of RA or IL-1beta , or both .	
12385002_s6	Either RA or IL-1beta could significantly inhibit the proliferation of HMEC .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12385002_s7	However , the addition of soluble IL-1 receptor antagonist ( sIL-1ra ) to the cell culture medium did not block RA-induced HMEC growth inhibition , whereas sIL-1ra did block the growth inhibition of HMEC by IL-1beta .	
12385002_s8	IL-1beta expression was not observed in the three carcinoma cell lines , MCF-7 , MDA-MB-231 , and MDA-MB-468 , as compared to the HMEC .	
12385002_s9	Growth curves of the breast carcinoma cell lines showed strong inhibitory effects of RA and IL-1beta on the growth of the estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive MCF-7 cell line , but only a small effect on the ER negative MDA-MB-231 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12385002_s10	The expression of the IL-1beta gene was also transcriptionally activated by RA in normal epithelial cells of prostate and oral cavity .	
12385002_s11	Our results suggest that : ( a ) the IL-1beta gene is a primary target of RA receptors in HMEC ; ( b ) the enhanced expression of the IL-1beta gene does not mediate the RA-induced growth arrest of HMEC ; and ( c ) the expression of the IL-1beta gene is low or absent in all three human breast carcinoma cell lines examined , but the defect in the IL-1beta signaling pathway may be different in ER positive versus ER negative carcinoma cells .	
12386826_s0	Genetic immunotherapy with tumor antigen gene-modified dendritic cells ( DC ) generates robust immunity , although antitumor protection is not complete in all models .	
12386826_s1	Previous experience in a model in which C57BL/6 mice immunized with DC transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing MART-1 demonstrated a 20-40% complete protection to a tumor challenge with B16 melanoma cells .	
12386826_s2	Tumors that did develop in immunized mice had slower growth kinetics compared to tumors implanted in naï¿½ve mice .	
12386826_s3	In the present study , we wished to determine if the supraphysiological production of the Th1-skewing cytokine interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) could enhance immune activation and antitumor protection in this model .	
12386826_s4	In a series of experiments immunizing mice with DC cotransduced with MART-1 and IL-12 , antitumor protection and antigen-specific splenocyte cytotoxicity and interferon gamma production inversely correlated with the amount of IL-12 produced by DC .	
12386826_s5	This adverse effect of IL-12 could not be explained by a direct cytotoxic effect of natural killer cells directed towards DC , nor the production of nitric oxide leading to down-regulation of the immune response - the two mechanisms previously recognized to explain immune-suppressive effects of IL-12-based vaccine therapy .	avoiding immune destruction
12386826_s6	In conclusion , in this animal model , IL-12 production by gene-modified DC leads to a cytokine-induced dose-dependent inhibition of antigen-specific antitumor protection .	
12387751_s0	2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) is the most potent tumor promoter ever tested in rodents .	
12387751_s1	Although it is known that most of TCDD actions are mediated by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) , the mechanisms leading to tumor promotion still remain to be elucidated .	
12387751_s2	Loss of contact inhibition is one characteristic hallmark in tumorigenesis .	
12387751_s3	In rat liver epithelial WB-F344 cells , TCDD induces a release from contact inhibition , which is manifested by a twofold increase in cell number when TCDD ( 1 nM for 48 h ) is added to confluent cells in the presence of serum , but not when given to exponentially growing or subconfluent , serum-deprived WB-F344 cells .	evading growth suppressors
12387751_s4	Loss of G1 arrest was also shown by flow cytometric analysis .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12387751_s5	We demonstrate that TCDD treatment significantly increases cyclin D2 and cyclin A protein levels and show by immunofluorescence that these proteins accumulate in the nucleus .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12387751_s6	Although TCDD treatment leads to a strong increase in cyclin D2/cdk4 and cyclin A/cdk2 complex formation , we could only detect an elevation of cyclin A/cdk2 activity .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12387751_s7	In accordance with a lack of elevated cdk4 activity , no decrease in the amount of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein could be shown after TCDD treatment .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12387751_s8	The importance of increased cyclin A/cdk2 activity for TCDD-dependent release from contact inhibition was shown by the fact that the cdk2/cdc2-specific inhibitor olomoucine ( 25 microM ) abolished TCDD response .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12387751_s9	These data indicate cyclin A-dependent loss of G1 arrest after TCDD treatment mainly downstream of the retinoblastoma protein .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12392158_s0	Retinoblastoma ( Rb ) is the most common intraocular tumor of childhood .	
12392158_s1	In this study we examined primary Rb specimens and Rb cell lines for the expression of immunoglobulin superfamily ( IgSF ) antigens : MHC class I and II ( MHC-I and MHC-II ) , neural cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , and Thy-1 , which play an important role in immune system and tumor cell interactions .	
12392158_s2	MHC-I and-II , ICAM-1 ( CD54 ) , NCAM ( CD56 ) , and Thy-1 ( CDw90 ) immunoreactivity was studied in eight primary Rb biopsy specimens using immunohistochemistry , three using immunoelectron microscopy , and six Rb cell lines using flow cytometry ( FCM ) .	
12392158_s3	Parenchymal and vascular-associated cells , phenotypically similar to retinal microglia , strongly expressed MHC-II immunoreactivity and were distributed throughout primary Rb specimens .	avoiding immune destruction
12392158_s4	However , MHC-II expression on Rb cell lines was similar to nonspecific control levels .	
12392158_s5	Tumor cells in primary Rb specimens displayed high NCAM , moderate Thy-1 , and low MHC-I and ICAM-1 immunolabeling .	
12392158_s6	Tumor vasculature expressed low to moderate MHC-I and ICAM-1 immunoreactivity and moderate Thy-1 immunoreactivity .	
12392158_s7	NCAM was not detected on the vasculature of primary Rb specimens .	
12392158_s8	Rb cell lines displayed variable expression of Thy-1 , ICAM-1 , and MHC-I .	
12392158_s9	NCAM was highly expressed on five of six Rb cell lines .	
12392158_s10	The high levels of constitutive NCAM immunoreactivity on Rb tumor cells confirm the neuroectodermal origins of this tumor .	
12392158_s11	Additionally , the variable expression of Thy-1 may suggest separate neural lineages or differences in the maturational status ofsome Rb tumors .	
12392158_s12	The presence of a population of infiltrating MHC-II-positive cells in primary Rb tumors has implications for immunomodulation of Rb growth .	
12393401_s0	We have previously reported that stressed apoptotic tumor cells are more immunogenic in vivo than nonstressed ones .	
12393401_s1	Using confocal microscopy we have confirmed our previous observation that heat-stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 leukemia cells ( BCR-ABL(+) ) express HSP60 and HSP72 on their surface .	
12393401_s2	To explore how the immune system distinguishes stressed from nonstressed apoptotic tumor cells , we analyzed the responses of dendritic cells to these 2 types of apoptotic cells .	
12393401_s3	We found that nonstressed and heat-stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were taken up by dendritic cells in a comparable fashion .	
12393401_s4	However , when stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were coincubated with immature dendritic cells for 24 hours , this resulted in greater up-regulation of costimulatory molecules ( CD40 , CD80 , and CD86 ) on the surface of dendritic cells .	
12393401_s5	Moreover , stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells were more effective in stimulating dendritic cells to secrete interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) and in enhancing their immunostimulatory functions in mixed leukocyte reactions .	avoiding immune destruction,resisting cell death
12393401_s6	Furthermore , we demonstrated that immunization of mice with stressed apoptotic 12B1-D1 cells induced the secretion of T helper-1 ( T(H)1 ) profile of cytokines by spleen cells .	avoiding immune destruction
12393401_s7	Splenocytes from mice immunized with stressed apoptotic cells , but not nonstressed ones , were capable of lysing 12B1-D1 and the parental 12B1 line , but not a B-cell leukemia line , A20 .	
12393401_s8	Our data indicate that stressed apoptotic tumor cells are capable of providing the necessary danger signals , likely through increased surface expression of heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) , resulting in activation/maturation of dendritic cells and , ultimately , the generation of potent antitumor T-cell responses .	avoiding immune destruction,resisting cell death
12408370_s0	Hormone replacement therapy , which is a common menopausal treatment , is contraindicated in women with breast cancers due to concerns regarding the potential for breast cell proliferation .	
12408370_s1	As such , there is a need for alternative methods for treating menopausal symptoms .	
12408370_s2	To determine the influence of one such alternative , black cohosh ( Cimicifuga racemosa [ CR] ) , on estrogen-dependent mammary cancers , we conducted an in vitro investigation of the effect of an isopropanolic CR-extract on the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells .	
12408370_s3	The experiments were performed using the human breast adenocarcinoma ( MCF-7 ) cell test system , an established in vitro model for estrogen-dependent tumors .	
12408370_s4	The influence of CR-extract on the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells was determined by measuring the incorporation of radioactively labeled thymidine .	
12408370_s5	Under estrogen-deprived conditions , the CR-extract ( 10(-3)-10(-5) dilutions ) significantly inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12408370_s6	Additionally , application of the CR-extract inhibited estrogen-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12408370_s7	Moreover , the proliferation-inhibiting effect of tamoxifen was enhanced by the CR-extract .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12408370_s8	Such data that suggest a non-estrogenic , or estrogen-antagonistic effect of CR on human breast cancer cells lead to the conclusion that CR treatment may be a safe , natural remedy for menopausal symptoms in breast cancer .	
12409831_s0	INTRODUCTION AND AIMS The survival of pancreatic cancer patients with portal vein resection is extremely poor due to the high incidence of liver metastasis .	
12409831_s1	The occurrence of liver metastasis is decreased by locoregional arterial infusion after pancreatic surgery .	
12409831_s2	Chemosensitivity tests can provide the basis for individualized chemotherapy in each patient and predict the clinical response .	
12409831_s3	Therefore , the current study was designed to clarify whether locoregional chemotherapy based on the results of chemosensitivity tests has the clinical effects of preventing liver metastasis and improving survival for patients with portal vein resection .	
12409831_s4	METHODOLOGY The resected specimens from 40 of 47 patients with resection of pancreatic cancer were assessed for chemosensitivity to various anticancer drugs .	
12409831_s5	Fourteen patients underwent portal vein resection due to direct invasion , and nine of these patients received intra-arterial adjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of the results of MTT assay to prevent liver metastasis .	
12409831_s6	The remaining five patients received no chemotherapy .	
12409831_s7	RESULTS None of the patients who received intra-arterial chemotherapy had liver metastasis , and this group of patients had improved survival .	activating invasion and metastasis
12409831_s8	The mean survival of patients with intra-arterial chemotherapy was significantly longer than that of patients without chemotherapy ( 25.6 months with chemotherapy versus 9.4 months without chemotherapy ) .	
12409831_s9	CONCLUSION A pilot study of postoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy showed the reduction of liver metastasis and improvement of survival among pancreatic cancer patients with portal vein resection .	activating invasion and metastasis
12415261_s0	Tumor cells are elusive targets for immunotherapy due to their heterogeneity and genetic instability .	
12415261_s1	Here we describe a novel , oral DNA vaccine that targets stable , proliferating endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature rather than tumor cells .	
12415261_s2	Targeting occurs through upregulated vascular-endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( FLK-1 ) of proliferating endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature .	
12415261_s3	This vaccine effectively protected mice from lethal challenges with melanoma , colon carcinoma and lung carcinoma cells and reduced growth of established metastases in a therapeutic setting .	activating invasion and metastasis
12415261_s4	CTL-mediated killing of endothelial cells indicated breaking of peripheral immune tolerance against this self antigen , resulting in markedly reduced dissemination of spontaneous and experimental pulmonary metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
12415261_s5	Angiogenesis in the tumor vasculature was suppressed without impairment of fertility , neuromuscular performance or hematopoiesis , albeit with a slight delay in wound healing .	inducing angiogenesis
12415261_s6	Our strategy circumvents problems in targeting of genetically unstable tumor cells .	
12415261_s7	This approach may provide a new strategy for the rational design of cancer therapies .	
12417717_s0	The INK4a/ARF tumor suppressor locus is implicated in the senescence-like growth arrest provoked by oncogenic Ras in primary cells .	
12417717_s1	INK4a and ARF are distinct proteins encoded by transcripts in which a shared exon is decoded in alternative reading frames .	
12417717_s2	Here we analyze dermal fibroblasts ( designated Q34 ) from an individual carrying independent missense mutations in each copy of the common exon .	
12417717_s3	Both mutations alter the amino acid sequence of INK4a and functionally impair the protein , although they do so to different degrees .	genomic instability and mutation
12417717_s4	Only one of the mutations affects the sequence of ARF , causing an apparently innocuous change near its carboxy terminus .	genomic instability and mutation
12417717_s5	Unlike normal human fibroblasts , Q34 cells are not permanently arrested by Ras or its downstream effectors Ets1 and Ets2 .	
12417717_s6	Moreover , ectopic Ras enables the cells to grow as anchorage-independent colonies , and in relatively young Q34 cells anchorage independence can be achieved without addition of telomerase or perturbation of the p53 pathway .	
12417717_s7	Whereas ARF plays the principal role in Ras-induced arrest of mouse fibroblasts , our data imply that INK4a assumes this role in human fibroblasts .	
12420227_s0	Using standard culture conditions , primary human mammary epithelial cells ( HMECs ) undergo a premature , transient growth arrest termed M0 ( mortality stage 0 ) after 10-15 population doublings in vitro .	
12420227_s1	It has been reported that emergence from this growth arrest by the abrogation of p16(INK4a) , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , and expression of the catalytic component of human telomerase ( hTERT ) are necessary for HMEC immortalization .	enabling replicative immortality
12420227_s2	Here we show that primary HMECs , grown on feeder layers , do not undergo this growth arrest and can be immortalized without abrogating p16 .	enabling replicative immortality
12420227_s3	These findings support the concept that the so-called M0 stage represents a cell culture stress-induced growth arrest and that hTERT is sufficient to immortalize HMECs when cultured under adequate conditions .	enabling replicative immortality
12426565_s0	Optimal lymphocyte activation requires the simultaneous engagement of stimulatory and costimulatory receptors .	
12426565_s1	Stimulatory immunoreceptors are usually composed of a ligand-binding transmembrane protein and noncovalently associated signal-transducing subunits .	
12426565_s2	Here , we report that alternative splicing leads to two distinct NKG2D polypeptides that associate differentially with the DAP10 and KARAP ( also known as DAP12 ) signaling subunits .	
12426565_s3	We found that differential expression of these isoforms and of signaling proteins determined whether NKG2D functioned as a costimulatory receptor in the adaptive immune system ( CD8+ T cells ) or as both a primary recognition structure and a costimulatory receptor in the innate immune system ( natural killer cells and macrophages ) .	avoiding immune destruction
12426565_s4	This strategy suggests a rationale for the multisubunit structure of stimulatory immunoreceptors .	avoiding immune destruction
12429650_s0	PURPOSE Osteosarcoma is an aggressive primary bone cancer characterized by expression of platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and its cognate receptor .	
12429650_s1	Coexpression of the growth factor and receptor suggests their role in autocrine or paracrine growth mechanisms .	
12429650_s2	It has been reported previously that STI571 has specific activity in inhibiting select tyrosine kinase receptors , including PDGF and c-Kit .	
12429650_s3	Osteosarcomas express low levels of c-Kit but abundant levels of PDGF receptor ( PDGFR ) .	
12429650_s4	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN To investigate the potential of STI571 as therapy for osteosarcoma , we studied its effects on PDGF-mediated cell growth in vitro and in an in vivo mouse model .	
12429650_s5	RESULTS PDGF acted as a potent mitogen in a dose-dependent manner in two osteosarcoma cell lines .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12429650_s6	STI571 ( 1.0 micro M ) inhibited both PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta phosphorylation and the downstream phosphorylation targets extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12429650_s7	STI571 also inhibited PDGF-mediated growth and induced apoptosis in vitro as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling staining .	resisting cell death
12429650_s8	To study the effect of STI571 alone or in combination with Taxol in an in vivo model , an osteosarcoma cell line ( KRIB ) was transplanted into the tibia of athymic nude mice .	
12429650_s9	Mice were treated with STI571 ( 50 mg/kg p.o. q M-F ) , Taxol ( 8 mg/kg i.p. weekly ) , or STI571 plus Taxol for 6 weeks .	
12429650_s10	There was no significant difference in tumor size between treatment and control mice .	
12429650_s11	Aberrant signaling pathways downstream of the PDGFR in the v-Ki-ras oncogene-transformed KRIB cell line may in part explain this finding .	
12429650_s12	CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate that STI571 inhibits PDGF-mediated growth and leads to apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells in vitro by selective inhibition of the PDGFR tyrosine kinase .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
12429650_s13	The effectiveness of STI571 in our studies suggests targeting of PDGFRs as a novel treatment for osteosarcoma .	
12429974_s0	Onconase ( Onc ) is an amphibian ribonuclease of the pancreatic RNase family that is cytostatic and cytotoxic to several tumor lines .	
12429974_s1	It also shows anti-tumor activity in mouse tumor models and is currently in phase III clinical trials .	
12429974_s2	In animal tests and clinical trials Onc shows lesser toxicity and fewer side effects compared to most chemotherapeutic drugs .	
12429974_s3	Intriguingly , repeated infusions of this protein do not cause apparent immunological reactions in patients .	
12429974_s4	The aim of the present study was to investigate sensitivity to Onc of human lymphocytes during their mitogenic stimulation in response to the polyvalent mitogen phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) , and in mixed allogeneic lymphocyte cultures .	
12429974_s5	Unexpectedly , we observed that frequency of cells undergoing activation-induced apoptosis was markedly increased in all cultures containing Onc .	resisting cell death
12429974_s6	Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using markers that detect activation of caspases , the in situ presence of DNA strand breaks , and loss of fragmented DNA ( 'sub-G1 ' cell subpopulation ) .	
12429974_s7	The enhancement of frequency of activation-induced apoptosis ( up to 244% ) was observed at 4.2-83 nM Onc concentration , which is at least an order magnitude lower than its minimal concentration reported to affect proliferation or induce apoptosis of leukemic and solid tumor cell lines .	resisting cell death
12429974_s8	The cell cycle progression of lymphocytes that responded to PHA mitogenically was not affected at 8.3 or 83 nM Onc concentration .	
12429974_s9	Because activation-induced apoptosis is the key mechanism regulating several in vivo immunological functions including induction of tolerance , the observed effects of Onc may explain the apparent lack of immune reactions to this protein in treated patients .	avoiding immune destruction,resisting cell death
12429974_s10	The propensity of Onc to potentiate the activation-induced apoptosis suggests that this drug may have clinical utility as immunomodulating agent , e.g. , to suppress transplant rejection or treat autoimmune diseases .	avoiding immune destruction,resisting cell death
12430006_s0	We studied whether feeding pregnant female rats different high fat diets affects structural zones in the spleen and lymph nodes , involved in production of T and B cells , as well as cell kinetics and apoptosis in some offspring with mammary glands tumors .	
12430006_s1	Rat mothers were fed either a 7% or 15% corn-oil or a 7% or 15% olive-oil diet .	
12430006_s2	At four weeks of age , female offspring ( n=10-15 per group ) were transferred to 7% corn oil diet .	
12430006_s3	Five-week old offspring were exposed twice to the carcinogen , dimethylbenz(a)antracene ( 10 mg/rat/week ) .	
12430006_s4	Three months later , tumors were counted and sized , and samples from the spleen , axillary lymph nodes and tumors collected for immunohistochemical analyses .	
12430006_s5	Feeding the mothers with both the 7% and 15% olive-oil diets significantly increased the number of tumor-free rats in offspring .	
12430006_s6	Tumors were characterized with active mitosis , intensive lymphoid infiltration inside a knot and high rates of apoptosis , particularly in tumors obtained from rats whose mothers were fed the 15% olive-oil diet .	resisting cell death
12430006_s7	In the spleen , the 15% olive-oil diet significantly increased the areas of the follicles and germinal centers but only in tumor-free rats .	
12430006_s8	In tumor-bearing rats , areas of germinal centers increased compared to the 7% olive-oil diet .	
12430006_s9	The 15% olive-oil diet increased all areas of the lymph nodes in tumor-free rats , while in tumor-bearing rats , this diet increased the areas of the cortex and mantle layer .	
12430006_s10	We conclude that exposure to various diets in utero and during lactation affects the immune system .	avoiding immune destruction
12430006_s11	In addition , the promotion of apoptosis may play a key role in the mechanisms involved in the transplacental effects on mammary tumor development as seen using a 15% olive-oil diet , similar to the high fat diets of Mediterranean countries .	resisting cell death
12431980_s0	Annexin II is secreted into the extracellular environment , where , via interactions with specific proteases and extracellular matrix proteins , it participates in plasminogen activation , cell adhesion , and tumor metastasis and invasion .	
12431980_s1	However , mechanisms regulating annexin II transport across the cellular membrane are unknown .	
12431980_s2	In this study , we used coimmunoprecipitation to show that Annexin-II was bound to insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) receptors in PC12 cells and NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing insulin ( NIH-3T3(IR) ) or IGF-1 receptor ( NIH-3T3(IGF-1R) ) .	
12431980_s3	Stimulation of insulin and IGF-1 receptors by insulin caused a temporary dissociation of annexin II from these receptors , which was accompanied by an increased amount of extracellular annexin II detected in the media of PC12 , NIH-3T3(IR) , and NIH-3T3(IGF-1R) cells but not in that of untransfected NIH-3T3 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12431980_s4	Activation of a different growth factor receptor , the platelet-derived growth factor receptor , did not produce such results .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12431980_s5	Tyrphostin AG1024 , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of insulin and IGF-1 receptor , was shown to inhibit annexin II secretion along with reduced receptor phosphorylation .	
12431980_s6	Inhibitors of a few downstream signaling enzymes including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , pp60c-Src , and protein kinase C had no effect on insulin-induced annexin II secretion , suggesting a possible direct link between receptor activation and annexin II secretion .	
12431980_s7	Immunocytochemistry revealed that insulin also induced transport of the membrane-bound form of annexin II to the outside layer of the cell membrane and appeared to promote cell aggregation .	
12431980_s8	These results suggest that the insulin receptor and its signaling pathways may participate in molecular mechanisms mediating annexin II secretion .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12434285_s0	Dietary exposure to aflatoxins is one of the major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma .	
12434285_s1	Individual susceptibility to aflatoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis may be modulated by both genetic and environmental factors affecting metabolism .	
12434285_s2	A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate determinants of the formation of aflatoxin covalently bound to albumin ( AFB1-albumin adducts ) .	
12434285_s3	A total of 474 subjects who were free of liver cancer and cirrhosis and were initially selected as controls for previous case-control studies of aflatoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in Taiwan , were employed in this study .	
12434285_s4	Aflatoxin-albumin adducts were determined by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis C virus by enzyme immunoassay , as well as genotypes of glutathione S-transferase M1-1 and T1-1 by polymerase chain reaction .	
12434285_s5	The detection rate of AFB1-albumin adducts was significantly higher in males ( 42.5% ) than in females ( 21.6% ) ( multivariate-adjusted odds ratio=2.6 , 95% confidence interval=1.4-5.0 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
12434285_s6	The formation of detectable albumin adducts was moderately higher in hepatitis B surface antigen carriers ( 42.8% ) than in non-carriers ( 36.6% ) ( multivariate-adjusted odds ratio=1.4 , 95% confidence interval=1.0-2.1 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
12434285_s7	In addition , the detection rate of AFB1-albumin adducts tended to increase with the increasing number of null genotypes of glutathione S-transferase M1-1 and glutathione S-transferase T1-1 .	genomic instability and mutation
12434285_s8	In conclusion , this cross-sectional study has assessed the relative contributions of environmental exposure and host susceptibility factors in the formation of AFB1-albumin adducts in a well characterised Chinese adult population .	genomic instability and mutation
12434285_s9	This study further emphasises the necessity to reduce aflatoxin exposure in people living in an area endemic for chronic hepatitis B virus infection .	
12435633_s0	A large number of human cancers display alterations in the Ink4a/cyclin D/Cdk4 genetic pathway , suggesting that activation of Cdk4 plays an important role in oncogenesis .	
12435633_s1	Here we report that Cdk4-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to transformation in response to Ras activation with dominant-negative ( DN ) p53 expression or in the Ink4a/Arf-null background , judged by foci formation , anchorage-independent growth , and tumorigenesis in athymic mice .	
12435633_s2	Cdk4-null fibroblasts proliferate at normal rates during early passages .	
12435633_s3	Whereas Cdk4(+/+)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells are immortal in culture , Cdk4(-/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells undergo senescence during continuous culture , as do wild-type cells .	enabling replicative immortality
12435633_s4	Activated Ras also induces premature senescence in Cdk4(-/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells and Cdk4(-/-) cells with DNp53 expression .	enabling replicative immortality
12435633_s5	Thus , Cdk4 deficiency causes senescence in a unique Arf/p53-independent manner , which accounts for the loss of transformation potential .	enabling replicative immortality
12435633_s6	Cdk4-null cells express high levels of p21(Cip1/Waf1) with increased protein stability .	
12435633_s7	Suppression of p21(Cip1/Waf1) by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , as well as expression of HPV-E7 oncoprotein , restores immortalization and Ras-mediated transformation in Cdk4(-/-)Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells and Cdk4(-/-) cells with DNp53 expression .	enabling replicative immortality
12435633_s8	Therefore , Cdk4 is essential for immortalization , and suppression of Cdk4 could be a prospective strategy to recruit cells with inactive Arf/p53 pathway to senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
12438278_s0	Alterations of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene are common in some forms of cancer and the most frequent is a deletion of exons 2-7 .	
12438278_s1	We have previously shown that this mutant receptor , called DeltaEGFR , confers enhanced tumorigenicity to glioblastoma cells through elevated proliferation and reduced apoptotic rates of the tumor cells in vivo .	
12438278_s2	To understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie DeltaEGFR-enhanced proliferation , we examined the gene products that control cell cycle progression .	
12438278_s3	We found that levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor , p27 , were lower in U87MG.DeltaEGFR tumors than in parental U87MG or control U87MG.DK tumors .	evading growth suppressors
12438278_s4	Consequently , CDK2-cyclin A activity was also elevated , concomitant with the RB protein hyperphosphorylation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12438278_s5	In addition , activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-K ) and phosphorylated Akt levels were also elevated in the U87MG.DeltaEGFR tumors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12438278_s6	U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells failed to arrest in G(1) in response to serum starvation in vitro and while maintaining high levels of PI3-K activity and hyperphosphorylated RB .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12438278_s7	Treatment of U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells with LY294002 , a PI3-K inhibitor , caused reduced levels of phosphorylated Akt and concomitantly up-regulated levels of p27 .	
12438278_s8	Expression of a kinase dead dominant-negative Akt mutant in the U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells similarly resulted in up-regulation of p27 and down-regulation of tumorigenicity in vivo .	evading growth suppressors
12438278_s9	These results suggest that the constitutively active DeltaEGFR can enhance cell proliferation in part by down-regulation of p27 through activation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12438278_s10	This pathway may represent another therapeutic target for treatment of those aggressive glioblastomas expressing DeltaEGFR .	
12439605_s0	Whole body hyperthermia ( WBH ) has been used as an adjunct to radio-/chemotherapy in patients with various malignant diseases .	
12439605_s1	Although clear evidence is still missing , it has been hypothesized that an activation of the immune system might contribute to the therapeutic effect of WBH .	
12439605_s2	To examine whether a treatment with 60-minute 41.8 degrees C WBH as an adjunct to chemotherapy ( WBH-CT ) induces an activation of T cells , blood samples were collected at numerous time points before and up to 48 h post-treatment .	
12439605_s3	The aim of this study was to examine the effect of WBH-CT on the expression of a broad range of activation markers on peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) , on serum cytokines and intracellular cytokine levels in T cells , and the capacity of these cells to proliferate .	
12439605_s4	Immediately after 41.8 degrees C WBH-CT treatment , a drastic increase in peripheral natural killer ( NK ) cells ( P&lt;0.05 ) and CD56+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ; P&lt;0.01 ) in the patients ' peripheral blood was observed .	avoiding immune destruction
12439605_s5	At 5 h post-treatment , the percentages of both effector cell types had returned to baseline levels .	
12439605_s6	This transient phenomenon was accompanied by a short period of reduced T cell activity , indicated by diminished serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors ( sIL-2R ) at 3 h post-WBH-CT ( P&lt;0.05 ) and decreased lymphocytic proliferation at the same point in time .	avoiding immune destruction
12439605_s7	This first phase was followed by a marked but short-lived increase in the patients ' serum levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ; P&lt;0.01 ) during the first 5 h following treatment , with a subsequent decrease to baseline levels at 24 h and significantly increased serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) at 0 h ( P&lt;0.01 ) , 3 h ( P&lt;0.05 ) , 5 h ( P&lt;0.05 ) and 24 h ( P&lt;0.01 ) post-WBH-CT .	
12439605_s8	The third phase of the immunological consequences of WBH-CT consisted of an increase in the percentage of peripheral cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) expressing CD56 , reaching a maximum at 48 h post-WBH ( P&lt;0.01 ) .	avoiding immune destruction
12439605_s9	Furthermore , the percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing the T cell activation marker CD69 increased nearly two-fold over time , reaching its maximum at 48 h ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	avoiding immune destruction
12439605_s10	As an additional marker for T cell activation , serum levels of sIL-2R increased markedly ( P&lt;0.01 ) , reaching maximum levels at the same point in time .	
12439605_s11	Elevated intracellular concentrations of interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) and/or TNF-alpha in CD8+ T cells were found in 4 out of 5 patients at 24 h post-WBH-CT .	avoiding immune destruction
12439605_s12	Since similar changes were not observed in patients receiving chemotherapy alone , this is the first study to provide evidence for prolonged WBH-CT-induced activation of human T cells .	avoiding immune destruction
12439909_s0	AIM To investigate the progressive transformation of immortal cells of human fetal esophageal epithelium induced by human papillomavirus , and to examine biological criteria of sequential passage of cells , including cellular phenotype , proliferative rate , telomerase , chromosome and tumorigenicity .	
12439909_s1	METHODS The SHEE cell series consisted of immortalized embryonic esophageal epithelium which was in malignant transformation when cultivated over sixty passages without co-carcinogens .	
12439909_s2	Cells of the 10th , 31st , 60th and 85th passages were present in progressive development after being transfected with HPV .	
12439909_s3	Cells were cultivated in a culture flask and 24-hole cultural plates .	
12439909_s4	Progressive changes of morphology , cell growth , contact-inhibition , and anchorage-dependent growth characteristics were examined by phase contrast microscopy .	
12439909_s5	The cell proliferation rate was assayed by flow cytometry .	
12439909_s6	The modal number of chromosomes was analyzed .	
12439909_s7	HPV18E(6)E(7) was detected by Western blot methods and activities of telomerase were analyzed by TRAP .	
12439909_s8	Tumorigenicity of cells was detected with soft agar plates cultivated and with tumor formation in SCID mice .	
12439909_s9	RESULTS In morphological examination the 10th passage cells were in good differentiation , the 60th and 85th passages cells were in relatively poor differentiation , and the 31st passage cells had two distinct differentiations .	
12439909_s10	The characteristics of the 85th and 60th passage cells were weakened at contact-inhibition and anchorage-dependent growth .	evading growth suppressors
12439909_s11	Karyotypes of four stages of cells belonged to hyperdiploid or hypotriploid , and bimodal distribution of chromosomes appeared in the 31st and 60th passage cells .	
12439909_s12	All of these characteristics combined with a increasing trend .	
12439909_s13	The activities of telomerase were expressed in the latter three passages .	enabling replicative immortality
12439909_s14	Four fourths of SCID mice in the 85th passage cells and one fourth of SCID mice in the 60th passage cells developed tumors , but the cells in the 10th and 31st passage displayed no tumor formation .	
12439909_s15	CONCLUSION In continual cultivation of fetal esophageal epithelial cells with transduction of HPV18E(6)E(7) , cells from the 10th to the 85th passage were changed gradually from preimmortal , immortal , precancerous to malignantly transformed stages .	enabling replicative immortality
12439909_s16	All of these changes were in a dynamic progressive process .	
12439909_s17	The establishment of a continuous line of esophageal epithelium may provide a in vitro model of carcinogenesis induced by HPV .	
12441195_s0	We report the formation , detection , quantitation and structural characterization of products resulting from the adduction of deoxynucleosides ( deoxyadenosine , deoxyguanosine , deoxycytidine and 5-methyldeoxycytidine ) to the catechol estrogens ( CE ) of estrone , estradiol-17beta and estradiol-17 alpha .	
12441195_s1	The crude products are obtained in a one-pot synthesis through oxidation of catechols to quinones and subsequent Michael-type reaction with the deoxynucleosides in acidic medium .	
12441195_s2	In all experiments , adducts are detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis after HPLC separation ( LC/ESI/MS(n) ) .	
12441195_s3	The two pyrimidines deoxycytidine and 5-methyldeoxycytidine yield only CE adducts to deoxynucleosides , which correspond to stable adducts on DNA .	genomic instability and mutation
12441195_s4	For purines , the results depend on the CE ( 2,3- or 3,4-catechols ) used , the function and configuration on carbon 17 ( ketone for estrone , alcohol for alpha and beta isomers of estradiol ) , and on the purine itself ( deoxyadenosine or deoxyguanosine ) .	
12441195_s5	Both stable adducts and deglycosylated adducts are formed , and therefore formation of stable adducts on DNA as well as the loss of purines from the DNA strands could be possible .	genomic instability and mutation
12441195_s6	MS(2) and MS(3) experiments prove to be relevant for further structural determinations , enabling in some cases the elucidation of the regiochemistry of adduction on the A and B rings of the steroid moiety .	genomic instability and mutation
12441346_s0	Triggering tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 ( TNFR1 ) induces apoptosis in various cell lines .	
12441346_s1	In contrast , stimulation of TNFR1 in L929sA leads to necrosis .	
12441346_s2	Inhibition of HSP90 , a chaperone for many kinases , by geldanamycin or radicicol shifted the response of L929sA cells to TNF from necrosis to apoptosis .	resisting cell death
12441346_s3	This shift was blocked by CrmA but not by BCL-2 overexpression , suggesting that it occurred through activation of procaspase-8 .	
12441346_s4	Geldanamycin pretreatment led to a proteasome-dependent decrease in the levels of several TNFR1-interacting proteins including the kinases receptor-interacting protein , inhibitor of kappa B kinase-alpha , inhibitor of kappa B kinase-beta , and to a lesser extent the adaptors NF-kappaB essential modulator and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 .	
12441346_s5	As a consequence , NF-kappa B , p38MAPK , and JNK activation were abolished .	
12441346_s6	No significant decrease in the levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases , adaptor proteins TNFR-associated death domain and Fas-associated death domain , or caspase-3 , -8 , and -9 could be detected .	
12441346_s7	These results suggest that HSP90 client proteins play a crucial role in necrotic signaling .	resisting cell death
12441346_s8	We conclude that inhibition of HSP90 may alter the composition of the TNFR1 complex , favoring the caspase-8-dependent apoptotic pathway .	resisting cell death
12441346_s9	In the absence of geldanamycin , certain HSP90 client proteins may be preferentially recruited to the TNFR1 complex , promoting necrosis .	resisting cell death
12441346_s10	Thus , the availability of proteins such as receptor-interacting protein , Fas-associated death domain , and caspase-8 can determine whether TNFR1 activation will lead to apoptosis or to necrosis .	resisting cell death
12441637_s0	Genomic instability has long been recognized as the main feature of neoplasia and a factor modulating individual cancer susceptibility .	
12441637_s1	There are attempts to find effective assays of both individual DNA repair capacity and genetic instability , and their relation to the cancer risk .	
12441637_s2	Genetic predisposition plays an important role in the etiology and development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) .	
12441637_s3	The aim of our study was to search for a correlation between chromosomal instability and DNA repair capacity in HNSCC patients and healthy controls .	
12441637_s4	The chromosomal instability was measured by the number of bleomycin ( BLM)-induced chromosomal aberrations and diepoxybutane ( DEB)-induced sister chromatid exchanges .	
12441637_s5	The DNA repair capacity was assessed using the DEB-induced adaptive response ( AR ) .	
12441637_s6	The HNSCC patients in our study showed a significant increase in chromosomal instability after a preterminal exposure of their lymphocytes to either BLM for the last 5 h or DEB for the last 24 h of incubation .	genomic instability and mutation
12441637_s7	However , the AR was higher in HNSCC patients than in the control group , suggesting an increase in the DNA repair capacity in the cancer patients as compared to the control .	genomic instability and mutation
12441637_s8	There is no correlation between the DNA repair capacity estimated on the basis of preterminal exposures to BLM and DEB and the DNA repair capacity estimated on the basis of the adaptive response to DEB .	genomic instability and mutation
12441637_s9	The preterminal exposure and the adaptive response test may activate different DNA repair mechanisms .	genomic instability and mutation
12444543_s0	Deregulation of D-type cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDK4 and 6 ) is widely observed in various human cancers , illustrating their importance in cell cycle control .	
12444543_s1	Like other cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) , assembly with cyclins is the most critical step for activation of CDK4/6 .	
12444543_s2	As previously reported elsewhere , we observed that the level of cyclinD1-CDK4 complex and its associated kinase activity were significantly low in asynchronously proliferating mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking both p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) ( p21/p27-null MEFs ) .	
12444543_s3	These evidences imply that p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) CDK inhibitors are ' essential activators ' of cyclin D-kinases .	evading growth suppressors
12444543_s4	We , however , discovered here that both the assembly and activation of cyclin D1-CDK4 complex occur when quiescent p21/p27-null MEFs were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle .	
12444543_s5	This mitogen-induced cyclin D1-kinase activity was blocked by overexpression of p16(INK4a) and resulted in the inhibition of S phase entry in p21/p27-null MEFs .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12444543_s6	Furthermore , ectopic expression of p34(SEI-1) , a mitogen-induced CDK4 binding protein , increased the levels of active cyclinD1-CDK4 complex in asynchronously proliferating p21/p27-null MEFs .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12444543_s7	Together , our results suggest that there are several independent ways to stimulate the assembly of cyclin D1-CDK4 kinases .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12444543_s8	Although p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) play a role in this process , our results demonstrate that additional mechanisms must occur in G0 to S phase transition .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12445208_s0	Rho GTPases are signaling molecules known to control cell motility .	
12445208_s1	Several recent studies have suggested a role for Rho proteins in mediating tumor metastasis independent of their affects on cell proliferation .	
12445208_s2	As Rho proteins require post-translational modification with a geranlygeranyl moiety for full activity , we tested the affect of blocking geranylation on localization , downstream signaling , and stimulation of invasion .	
12445208_s3	Expression of a constitutively active Rho construct in A375 melanoma cells dramatically stimulated invasion through Matrigel membranes ; however , a constitutively active RhoA mutated so that it cannot be geranylated , failed to stimulate invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
12445208_s4	Moreover , expression of epitope or GFP tagged modifications of this nongeranylatable constitutively active Rho demonstrated that geranylation is necessary for correct cellular localization of Rho .	
12445208_s5	Geranylation was also found to be necessary for full downstream activation of serum response factor mediated transcription .	
12445208_s6	Pharmacologic inhibition of Rho geranylation produced similar inhibition of Rho localization , signaling , and invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
12445208_s7	Our results suggest that inhibition of Rho geranylation may be an attractive pharmacologic target for inhibiting melanoma metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
12446006_s0	To assess the immune function of microglia and macrophages in brain tumors , the expression of MHC class II and B7 costimulatory molecules in three rodent glioma models was examined .	
12446006_s1	Microglia and macrophages , which accounted for 5-12% of total cells , expressed B7.1 and MHC class II molecules in the C6 and 9L tumors , but not RG2 gliomas .	
12446006_s2	Interestingly , the expression of B7.1 and MHC class II molecules by microglia and macrophage was associated with an increase in the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in C6 and 9L tumors .	
12446006_s3	B7.2 expression , which was present at low levels on microglia and macrophages in normal brain , did not significantly change in tumors .	
12446006_s4	Interestingly , the expression of all three surface antigens increased after microglia were isolated from intracranial C6 tumors and cultured for a short period of time .	
12446006_s5	We conclude that microglia immune activity may be suppressed in gliomas and directly correlates to the immunogenecity of experimental brain tumors .	avoiding immune destruction
12450390_s0	Comparative mutagenesis studies of N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene ( dG-AAF ) and N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene ( dG-AF ) adducts positioned in the Nar I restriction enzyme site were performed using Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and simian kidney ( COS-7 ) cells .	
12450390_s1	Oligodeoxynucleotides ( (5)(')TCCTCG(1)G(2)CG(3)CCTCTC ) containing a recognition sequence for the Nar I restriction enzyme were modified site-specifically with dG-AAF or dG-AF .	
12450390_s2	Modified and unmodified oligomers inserted into single-stranded phagemid shuttle vectors were used to transform E. coli or to transfect COS-7 cells .	
12450390_s3	Following replication in host cells , progeny plasmids were recovered and analyzed for mutations .	
12450390_s4	In SOS-induced E. coli , dG-AAF primarily induced one- and two-base deletions .	genomic instability and mutation
12450390_s5	The mutational frequency varied , depending on the position modified in the Nar I site ; 91% two-base deletions were observed at G(3) , while 8.4% and 2.8% deletions were detected at G(2) and G(1) , respectively .	genomic instability and mutation
12450390_s6	In contrast , dG-AF at any position in the Nar I site failed to produce deletions , generating primarily G --&gt ; T transversions ( mutational frequency , 7.6-8.4% ) .	genomic instability and mutation
12450390_s7	In COS-7 cells , both dG-AAF and dG-AF primarily induced G --&gt ; T transversions .	genomic instability and mutation
12450390_s8	Mutation frequencies for dG-AAF were 9.4-24% , the highest values being at G(1) and G(3) .	genomic instability and mutation
12450390_s9	Mutation frequencies for dG-AF were 9.3-21% , the higher value at G(2) .	genomic instability and mutation
12450390_s10	We conclude from this study that the mutation potential of dG-AAF and dG-AF depends on the structure of the adduct , the sequence context of the lesion , and the host cell used for the experiment .	genomic instability and mutation
12452049_s0	BACKGROUND &amp ; OBJECTIVE Altered cell adhesion has a critical role in the development of epithelial cancers .	
12452049_s1	E-cadherin act on the maintenance of cell-cell adhesion and its function was thought to be regulated by associated cytoplasmic proteins , such as alpha-catenin and beta-catenin .	
12452049_s2	This study was designed to examine the expression of beta-catenin in gastric carcinoma and to determine the relationship between tumor characteristics and survival .	
12452049_s3	METHODS Immunohistochemical staining of beta-catenin and E-cadherin was performed in 148 patients with gastric carcinoma .	
12452049_s4	RESULTS Abnormal expression of beta-catenin and E-cadherin was performed in 148 patients with gastric carcinoma .	
12452049_s5	RESULTS Abnormal expression of beta-catenin and E-cadherin was demonstrated in 43.2% and 44.6% of tumors respectively .	
12452049_s6	Up to 63% of tumors stained abnormally for one or two components of the cadherin-catenin complex ( beta-catenin , E-cadherin ) .	
12452049_s7	Abnormal beta-catenin and E-cadherin staining occurred more frequently in poor differentiated tumor than in good differentiated tumors ( P &lt ; 0.005 , respectively ) .	
12452049_s8	There was a significant correlation between abnormal beta-catenin expression and depth of invasion(P &lt ; 0.025 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
12452049_s9	Moreover , abnormal beta-catenin expression was more frequent in tumors with positive lymph node metastasis ( 45/84 , 53.6% ) and distance metastasis(21/31 , 67.7% ) than in tumors without lymph node metastasis ( 19/64 , 29.7% ) ( P &lt ; 0.005 ) and distance metastasis ( 43/117 , 36.8% ) ( P &lt ; 0.005 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
12452049_s10	A survival advantage was noted in tumors retaining normal membranous expression of beta-catenin , independent of type , grade , or stage ( P &lt ; 0.005 ) .	
12452049_s11	CONCLUSIONS Abnormal expression of the E-cadherin-catenin complex occurs frequently in gastric carcinoma .	
12452049_s12	The close correlation with poor survival suggests that abnormal beta-catenin may be a useful prognostic marker .	
12452332_s0	In an attempt to find a strategy to modulate the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells , we examined whether constitutive activation of proto-oncogen protein p21 ( Ras ) induced the reentry of confluent human umbilical vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) into the S phase .	
12452332_s1	When an adenovirus construct expressing a constitutively active Ras mutant ( Ad/RasG12V ) was infected into HUVECs , their morphology changed strikingly and they appeared to be transformed .	
12452332_s2	However , Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs did not enter the S phase , as determined by assessing 3H-thymidine incorporation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12452332_s3	In accordance with the above results , the expression of cyclin A both at the transcript and protein levels did not increase in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs relative to that in control cells , although the expression of cyclin D1 was induced in Ad/RasG12V-infected cells .	
12452332_s4	Interestingly , the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p21cip1 was remarkably increased while that of p27kip1 did not decrease in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs .	evading growth suppressors
12452332_s5	Furthermore , CDK2 activity was not induced in Ad/RasG12V-infected HUVECs .	
12452332_s6	These results suggested that the constitutive activation of Ras promoted the reentry of confluent HUVECs in the G0 phase into the G1 phase , but not into the S phase .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12452332_s7	The results also indicated that the constitutive activation of Ras might have induced the persistent expression of p21cip1 and p27kip1 , and that this induction of p21cip1 and p27kip1 expression possibly caused the cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12453272_s0	AIM The study was designed to explore the effects of antisense human telomerase RNA ( ahTR ) on the malignant phenotype of gastric carcinoma cell line SGC-7901 , and its potential role in gene therapy for tumors .	
12453272_s1	METHODS An ahTR eukaryotic expression vector , including the sequence of template region of telomere repeats , was constructed by recombinant technology of molecules and then transfected into gastric carcinoma cell line SGC-7901 by liposome DOTAP .	
12453272_s2	Subsequently , the expression of hTR RNA and ahTR RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , telomerase activity by telomeric repeat amplification protocol-ELISA ( TRAP-ELISA ) , telomere length by Southern blotting , cell morphology under light microscope , cellular proliferation capacity by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay , cell-cycle distribution by flow cytometry , efficiency of clone formation in soft agar , and tumorigenecity in nude mice were examined and evaluated in ahTR-transfected cells , control plasmid pCI-neo transfected cells and their parental cells .	
12453272_s3	RESULTS An ahTR eukaryotic expression vector was constructed and successfully transfected into SGC-7901 cells .	
12453272_s4	The telomerase activity in ahTR-transfected SGC-7901 cells decreased from 100% to approximately 25% , and telomere length in the cells shortened to 3.35 from 4.08 Kb at 60 population doublings .	
12453272_s5	Compared with the parental cells and pCI-neo transfected cells , ahTR-transfected cells displayed some morphological changes , such as decreased atypia , and recovery of contact inhibition and density inhibition under light microscope .	evading growth suppressors
12453272_s6	Furthermore , ahTR-transfected cells displayed decreased invasive capacity in Borden's chamber invasive model , increased G0/G1 phase rate and apoptotic rate .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
12453272_s7	Surprisingly , ahTR-transfected SGC-7901 cells lost their capacity for clone formation in soft agar and tumorigencity in nude mice .	
12453272_s8	CONCLUSION Antisense-hTR transfection can inhibit the growth of SGC-7901 cells and partially reverse the malignant phenotypes .	
12453272_s9	This study provides an exciting approach for cancer therapy by inhibiting telomerase activity using an antisense gene .	
12453409_s0	We identified REDD1 as a novel transcriptional target of p53 induced following DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
12453409_s1	During embryogenesis , REDD1 expression mirrors the tissue-specific pattern of the p53 family member p63 , and TP63 null embryos show virtually no expression of REDD1 , which is restored in mouse embryo fibroblasts following p63 expression .	
12453409_s2	In differentiating primary keratinocytes , TP63 and REDD1 expression are coordinately downregulated , and ectopic expression of either gene inhibits in vitro differentiation .	
12453409_s3	REDD1 appears to function in the regulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) ; we show that TP63 null fibroblasts have decreased ROS levels and reduced sensitivity to oxidative stress , which are both increased following ectopic expression of either TP63 or REDD1 .	tumor promoting inflammation
12453409_s4	Thus , REDD1 encodes a shared transcriptional target that implicates ROS in the p53-dependent DNA damage response and in p63-mediated regulation of epithelial differentiation .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
12460794_s0	Animal studies indicate that the immune system is one of the most sensitive targets of the toxic effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-p-dibenzodioxin ( TCDD ) .	
12460794_s1	TCDD inhibits immunoglobulin secretion and decreases resistance to bacterial , viral , and parasitic infections in exposed animals .	
12460794_s2	Nearly 20 years after the Seveso , Italy , accident , we measured immunoglobulin and complement plasma levels in a random sample of the population in the most highly exposed zones ( n = 62 ) and in the surrounding noncontaminated area ( n = 58 ) .	
12460794_s3	Plasma IgG levels decreased with increasing TCDD plasma concentration ( r = -0.35 , p = 0.0002 ) .	avoiding immune destruction
12460794_s4	Median IgG concentration decreased from 1,526 mg/dL in the group with the lowest ( &lt ; 3.5 ppt ) TCDD levels to 1,163 mg/dL in the group with the highest ( 20.1-89.9 ppt ) TCDD levels ( p = 0.002 ) .	avoiding immune destruction
12460794_s5	The association was significant ( p = 0.0004 ) after adjusting for age , sex , smoking , and consumption of domestic livestock and poultry in multiple regression analysis and persisted after exclusion of subjects with inflammatory diseases and those using antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs .	
12460794_s6	IgM , IgA , C3 , and C4 plasma concentrations did not exhibit any consistent association with TCDD levels .	
12460794_s7	We performed a systematic review of all the articles published between 1966 and 2001 on human subjects exposed to TCDD reporting information on circulating levels of immunoglobulins and/or complement components .	
12460794_s8	The literature indicates that the evidence for effects of TCDD on humoral immunity is sparse .	
12460794_s9	Methodologic issues , results , and possible sources of variation between studies are discussed .	
12460794_s10	The possible long-term immunologic effects of TCDD exhibited by the participants of the present study , coupled with the increased incidence of lymphatic tumors in the area of the accident , warrant further investigation .	avoiding immune destruction
12461298_s0	During mitotic exit , a small GTPase Tem1 needs to be activated .	
12461298_s1	During most of the cell cycle , Tem1 activity is antagonized by a GTPase activating complex ( GAP ) composed of Bub2 and Bfa1 .	
12461298_s2	Bfa1 protein has cell cycle regulated phosphorylation depending upon the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 .	
12461298_s3	This phosphorylation dissociates Bfa1 from Tem1 and thus relieves the inhibition of Tem1 by the GAP complex .	
12461298_s4	Bub2 and Bfa1 are also required to prevent mitotic exit when there is DNA damage , spindle damage or spindle misorientation at G(2)/M phase .	
12461298_s5	While Cdc5 inhibits Bfa1/Bub2 , mutating the Cdc5 phosphorylation sites on Bfa1 does not have a strong activating effect on Bub2/Bfa1 , suggesting there must be additional regulation in this pathway .	
12461298_s6	Here we report that Bub2 protein also has cell cycle regulated phosphorylation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12461298_s7	This phosphorylation is partially dependent upon the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 and is consistent with negative regulation of the Bub2/Bfa1 GAP complex .	
12461298_s8	Spindle damage or spindle misorientation prevents Bub2 phosphorylation .	
12461298_s9	The spindle damage effect is dependent upon the spindle assembly checkpoint components Mad2 and Mps1 .	
12461298_s10	Thus like Bfa1 , Bub2 protein is also controlled both during mitotic exit and in response to cell cycle checkpoints .	evading growth suppressors
12461298_s11	Bub2 phosphorylation is likely to be controlled by a novel kinase .	
12462603_s0	Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry has been used for the detection and the structural characterization of T-rich model oligonucleotides covalently modified by estradiol-2,3-quinone .	
12462603_s1	After separation by gradient elution , adducts were analyzed by negative electrospray mass spectrometry , enabling to evidence and localize the modifications in the oligonucleotide sequence .	
12462603_s2	Modifications by one molecule of estrogen were evidenced on purines ( A , G ) whereas no reaction was observed on pyrimidic bases ( T ) .	
12462603_s3	Isomeric adducts were differentiated using tandem mass spectrometry , and energy resolved mass spectrometry allowed to underline differences in the behavior of the adducts towards collisional excitation into an ion trap device .	genomic instability and mutation
12466123_s0	Prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) receptor subtype EP(2) , which is coupled to cAMP metabolism , is known to mediate proliferation of primary human keratinocytes in vitro .	
12466123_s1	The effect of gain or loss of EP(2) receptors in immortalized human keratinocytes ( HaCat cells ) was examined .	
12466123_s2	HaCat keratinocytes were transfected with sense or anti-sense constructs of the EP(2) receptor .	
12466123_s3	Loss or gain of EP(2) expression was documented by immunoblot and associated changes in agonist-stimulated cAMP production .	
12466123_s4	Loss or gain of EP(2) receptor expression correlated with alterations in plating efficiencies but with modest affects on growth .	
12466123_s5	When cell lines were studied in an organ culture model , anti-sense clones were highly invasive compared with vector controls and sense transfectants .	activating invasion and metastasis
12466123_s6	A marked increase in prostaglandin production is commonly seen in malignant lesions .	
12466123_s7	Because prostaglandin receptors are known to undergo ligand-induced receptor down-regulation , we sought to determine whether EP(2) receptor down-regulation results in increased invasiveness .	
12466123_s8	In vector controls , invasiveness was reproduced by ligand-dependent EP(2) receptor down-regulation as assessed by immunohistochemistry .	activating invasion and metastasis
12466123_s9	In addition , loss of EP(2) receptor expression was associated with decreased paxillin expression , a critical component of focal adhesion assembly .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12466123_s10	Thus , down-regulation of EP(2) receptors represents a potential mechanism for neoplastic progression to an invasive phenotype .	
12467216_s0	The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of sequence variants in the class I beta-tubulin ( clone m40 ) gene and their occurrence in human tumors and cancer cell lines .	
12467216_s1	DNA was isolated from 93 control individuals representing a wide variety of ethnicities , 49 paclitaxel-naive specimens ( 16 ovarian cancers , 17 non-small cell lung cancers , and 16 ovarian cancer cell lines ) , and 30 paclitaxel-resistant specimens ( 9 ovarian cancers , 9 ovarian cancer cell lines , and 12 ovarian cancer xenografts in nude mice ) .	
12467216_s2	Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequence analysis detected two silent polymorphisms in exon 4 , Leu217Leu ( CTG/CTA ) and Gly400Gly ( GGC/GGT ) , with minor allele frequencies of 17 and 0.5% , respectively .	
12467216_s3	Five nucleotide substitutions and one single-base deletion were detected in introns 1 , 2 , and 3 and in the 3 ' untranslated region .	genomic instability and mutation
12467216_s4	Analysis of 49 paclitaxel-naive and 30 paclitaxel-resistant specimens revealed no additional polymorphisms in the coding region .	
12467216_s5	In addition , no amino acid replacements were found in chimpanzee , gorilla , and orangutan in comparison to human .	
12467216_s6	Our data demonstrate a very high degree of sequence conservation in class I beta-tubulin , suggesting that all residues are important in tubulin structure and function .	
12467216_s7	Individual variation in response to treatment with paclitaxel is not likely to be caused by genetic variations in the beta-tubulin drug target .	
12467216_s8	Moreover , acquired mutations in class I beta-tubulin are unlikely to be a clinically relevant cause of drug resistance .	genomic instability and mutation
12468598_s0	Our previous studies have shown that genistein inhibits the growth of PC3 prostate cancer cells and induces apoptosis by inhibiting nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) and Akt signaling pathways .	
12468598_s1	To better understand the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which genistein exerts its effects on PC3 cells , we utilized cDNA microarray to interrogate 12,558 known genes to determine the gene expression profiles altered by genistein treatment .	
12468598_s2	We found a total of 832 genes that showed a greater than twofold change after genistein treatment from two independent experiments with a high degree of concordance .	
12468598_s3	Among these genes , 774 genes were down-regulated and 58 genes were up-regulated with genistein treatment .	
12468598_s4	Cluster analysis showed nine different types of expression alternations .	
12468598_s5	These genes were also subjected to cluster analysis according to their biological functions .	
12468598_s6	We found that genistein regulated the expression of genes that are critically involved in the regulation of cell growth , cell cycle , apoptosis , cell signaling transduction , angiogenesis , tumor cell invasion and metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis,resisting cell death
12468598_s7	Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) analysis was used to confirm the results of cDNA microarray , and the results of RT-PCR were consistent with the microarray data .	
12468598_s8	We conclude that genistein affected the expression of a large number of genes that are related to the control of cell survival and physiologic behaviors .	
12468598_s9	The gene expression profiles provide comprehensive molecular mechanism(s) by which genistein exerts its pleiotropic effects on cancer cells .	
12468598_s10	Genistein-induced regulation of these genes may be further exploited for devising chemopreventive and/or therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer .	
12470592_s0	The signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT)1 is a cytoplasmic-transcription factor that is phosphorylated by Janus kinases ( Jak ) in response to interferon gamma(IFN-gamma) .	
12470592_s1	The phosphorylated STAT1 translocates to the nucleus , where it turns on specific sets of IFN-gamma-inducible genes , such as the interferon regulatory factor ( IRF)-1 .	
12470592_s2	We show here that gamma irradiation reduces the IFN-gamma mRNA expression .	
12470592_s3	The inhibition of the STAT1 phosphorylation and the IRF-1 expression by gamma irradiation was also observed .	
12470592_s4	In contrast , the mRNA levels of IL-5 and transcription factor GATA-3 were slightly induced by gamma irradiation when compared to the non-irradiated sample .	
12470592_s5	Furthermore , we detected the inhibition of cell-mediated immunity by gamma irradiation in the allogenic-mixed lymphocytes ' reaction ( MLR ) .	
12470592_s6	These results postulate that gamma irradiation induces the polarized-Th2 response and interferes with STAT1 signals , thereby causing the immunosuppression of the Th1 response .	avoiding immune destruction
12473065_s0	Properly regulated keratinocyte cell death is fundamentally important to maintain structural integrity and homeostatic function of epidermis .	
12473065_s1	Moreover , from an oncological perspective , therapeutic approaches selectively targeting apoptosis of malignant cell types while sparing normal keratinocytes in surrounding skin is desirable .	
12473065_s2	Apo2Ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( Apo2L/TRAIL ) has been observed to preferentially induce cytopathic effects on transformed/malignant cell types compared with their non-neoplastic counterparts .	
12473065_s3	In this report , two different biologically active preparations of Apo2L/TRAIL , a non-tagged version , NT-Apo2L/TRAIL , and a leucine zipper fusion protein , LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL , were examined for their ability to trigger apoptosis in normal human keratinocytes , and in an immortalized cell line ( HaCaT cells ) .	
12473065_s4	Differences between these preparations were observed , including : NT-Apo2L/TRAIL induced less keratinocyte apoptosis compared with LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL ; NT-Apo2L/TRAIL also induced less apoptosis of HaCaT cells compared with LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL ; LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL but not NT-Apo2L/TRAIL induced cytotoxic effects when keratinocytes became growth arrested due to undergoing spontaneous replicative senescence--a biological state previously observed to be resistant to UV-light-induced apoptosis .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
12473065_s5	Similarities between preparations included : an enhanced ability for both Apo2L/TRAIL preparations to kill a greater relative percentage of HaCaT cells compared with keratinocytes ; enhanced cytotoxicity towards keratinocytes that had their NF-B activity inhibited ; a dependence of both Apo2L/TRAIL preparations on FADD and caspase activation ; triggering of the same caspase cascades including caspase 8 and 3 ; and an ability to induce apoptosis even when HaCaT cells and keratinocytes were transduced to overexpress either Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) ( survival factors that reduce susceptibility to UV-light-induced apoptosis ) .	resisting cell death
12473065_s6	These results indicate that while both preparations of Apo2L/TRAIL possess biological activity , there are important differences as regards their ability to induce apoptosis in normal and immortalized keratinocytes .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
12473065_s7	Moreover , the death receptor pathway triggered by LZ-Apo2L/TRAIL can overcome the apoptotic resistance normally observed in response to UV-light mediated by Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L) , as well as by the state of cellular senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
12473065_s8	Unraveling the molecular basis for these differential biological effects may reveal a new strategic role for these death receptor/ligands linked to apoptosis in maintaining the dynamic balance of keratinocyte proliferation , differentiation , and cell death necessary to achieve a homeostatic thickness and function of normal skin .	resisting cell death
12473065_s9	In addition , it may be possible to utilize these Apo2L/TRAIL preparations for the treatment of various sun-induced skin cancers as they can differentially trigger apoptosis of transformed keratinocytes , or keratinocytes with abnormal NF-kappaB signaling , while sparing adjacent normal keratinocytes .	resisting cell death
12473681_s0	4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal ( HNE ) , a major racemic product of lipid peroxidation , reacts with histidine to form a stable HNE-histidine Michael addition-type adduct possessing three chiral centers in the cyclic hemiacetal structure .	
12473681_s1	In the present study , we characterized configurational isomers of a HNE-N(alpha)-acetylhistidine adduct by NMR spectroscopy and by molecular orbital calculations .	
12473681_s2	In addition , we raised monoclonal antibodies against ( R)-HNE-histidine and ( S)-HNE-histidine adducts , characterized their specificities , and examined in vivo localizations of each adduct under oxidative stress .	
12473681_s3	To facilitate structural characterization of the configurational isomers of an HNE-histidine adduct , we prepared the ( R)-HNE-histidine and ( S)-HNE-histidine adducts by incubating N(alpha)-acetylhistidine with each HNE enantiomer , both of which provided two peaks ( Ra and Rb from ( R)-HNE-histidine and Sa and Sb from ( S)-HNE-histidine adducts ) in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography .	
12473681_s4	The NMR analysis showed that each peak was a mixture of two diastereomers .	
12473681_s5	In addition , the analysis of the nuclear Overhauser effect enabled the determination of configurations of the eight isomers .	
12473681_s6	The relative amounts of these isomers in the NMR analysis correlated with the relative energies calculated by molecular orbital methods .	
12473681_s7	On the other hand , using ( R)-HNE-modified and ( S)-HNE-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanins as the antigens , we raised the monoclonal antibodies , mAbR310 and mAbS412 , which enantioselectively recognized the ( R)-HNE-histidine and ( S)-HNE-histidine adducts , respectively .	genomic instability and mutation
12473681_s8	Among the mixtures ( Ra , Rb , Sa , and Sb ) of diastereomers , mAbR310 showed the highest immunoreactivity to Rb ( the mixture of 2R,4S,5R and 2S,4S,5R isomers ) , whereas mAbS412 preferentially recognized Sa ( the mixture of 2R,4S,5S and 2S,4S,5S isomers ) .	
12473681_s9	The presence of ( R)-HNE and ( S)-HNE epitopes in vivo was immunohistochemically examined in the kidney of rats exposed to the renal carcinogen , ferric nitrilotriacetate , by which nuclear and cytosolic stainings with mAbR310 and mAbS412 , respectively , were detected .	
12475992_s0	The ability of p53 to alter , at the transcriptional level , the gene expression of downstream targets is critical for its role as a tumor suppressor .	
12475992_s1	Most models of p53 activation postulate the stepwise recruitment by p53 of coactivators , histone acetyltransferases , and/or chromatin remodeling factors to a promoter region to facilitate the subsequent access of the general transcriptional machinery required for transcriptional induction .	
12475992_s2	We demonstrate here , however , that the promoter regions for the p53 target genes , p21 , 14-3-3sigma , and KARP-1 , exist in a constitutively open conformation that is readily accessible to DNase I. This conformation was not altered by DNA damage or by whether p53 was present or absent in the cell .	genomic instability and mutation
12475992_s3	In contrast , p53 response elements , which resided outside the immediate promoter regions , existed within DNase I-resistant chromatin domains .	
12475992_s4	Thus , p53 activation of downstream target genes occurs without p53 inducing chromatin alterations detectable by DNase I accessibility at either the promoter or the response element .	
12475992_s5	As such , these data support models of p53 activation that do not require extensive chromatin alterations to support cognate gene expression .	
12478469_s0	The HT29 adenocarcinoma is a common model of epithelial cell differentiation and colorectal cancer and its death is an oft-analyzed response to TNF family receptor signaling .	
12478469_s1	The death event itself remains poorly characterized and here we have examined the involvement of caspases using pan-caspase inhibitors. zVAD-fmk did not block death of HT29 cells in response to activation of the Fas , TRAIL , TNF , TWEAK and LTbeta receptors .	
12478469_s2	The secondary induction of TNF or the other known bona fide death inducing ligands did not account for death following LTbeta receptor activation indicating that TNF family receptors can trigger a caspase-independent death pathway regardless of the presence of canonical death domains in the receptor .	resisting cell death
12478469_s3	To provide a frame of reference , the phenotype of HT29 death was compared to four other TNF family receptor triggered death events ; Fas induced Jurkat cell apoptosis , TNF/zVAD induced L929 fibroblast necrosis , TNF induced death of WEHI 164 fibroblastoid cells and TNF/zVAD induced U937 death .	
12478469_s4	The death of HT29 and U937 cells under these conditions is an intermediate form with both necrotic and apoptotic features .	resisting cell death
12478469_s5	The efficient coupling of TNF receptors to a caspase-independent death event in an epithelial cell suggests an alternative approach to cancer therapy .	
12479700_s0	A number of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs designed to have cytotoxic actions on tumor cells have recently been shown to also have antiangiogenic activities .	
12479700_s1	Endothelial cell migration and proliferation are key components of tumor angiogenesis , and agents that target the microtubule cytoskeleton can interfere with these processes .	
12479700_s2	In this study , the effect on endothelial cell functions of the microtubule-stabilizing drugs Taxotere and Taxol were evaluated in three in vitro assays : a chemokinetic migration assay , an angiogenesis factor-mediated chemotactic migration assay , and a three-dimensional Matrigel tubule formation assay , using rat fat pad endothelial cells ( RFPECs ) and/or human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) .	
12479700_s3	Taxotere was active in all three assays at concentrations that were not cytotoxic and did not inhibit endothelial cell proliferation .	inducing angiogenesis
12479700_s4	In the RFPEC chemokinetic migration and in vitro tubule formation assays , the IC50 values were approximately 10(-9) M for both Taxotere and Taxol .	inducing angiogenesis
12479700_s5	HUVEC migration , however , was more sensitive to Taxotere , with an observed IC50 of 10(-12) M in a chemokinetic assay .	
12479700_s6	In a Boyden chamber assay , HUVEC chemotaxis stimulated by either of two angiogenic factors , thymidine phosphorylase or vascular endothelial growth factor , was inhibited by Taxotere with an IC50 of 10(-11) M and was ablated at 10(-9) M. Taxotere was also up to 1000-fold more potent than Taxol in inhibiting either chemokinetic or chemotactic migration .	
12479700_s7	When the microtubule cytoskeleton was visualized using immunofluorescence staining of alpha-tubulin , there were no gross morphological changes observed in HUVECs or RFPECs treated with Taxotere at concentrations that inhibited endothelial cell migration but not proliferation .	
12479700_s8	The effects of Taxotere on migration were associated with a reduction in the reorientation of the cell's centrosome , at concentrations that did not affect gross microtubule morphology or proliferation .	
12479700_s9	Reorientation of the centrosome , which acts as the microtubule organizing center , in the intended direction of movement is a critical early step in the stabilization of directed cell migration .	
12479700_s10	These data indicate that endothelial cell migration correlates more closely with changes in microtubule plasticity than with microtubule gross structure .	
12479700_s11	The antiangiogenic activity of Taxotere in vivo was assessed in a Matrigel plug assay .	
12479700_s12	In this assay , the angiogenic response to fibroblast growth factor 2 was inhibited in vivo by Taxotere with an ID50 of 5.4 mg/kg when injected twice weekly over a 14-day period , and angiogenesis was completely blocked in mice that received 10 mg/kg Taxotere .	inducing angiogenesis
12479700_s13	The in vivo data further suggested that Taxotere had selectivity for endothelial cell migration and/or microvessel formation because infiltration of inflammatory cells into the Matrigel plug was much less sensitive to inhibition by Taxotere .	inducing angiogenesis,tumor promoting inflammation
12479700_s14	In conclusion , Taxotere is a potent and potentially specific inhibitor of endothelial cell migration in vitro and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo .	inducing angiogenesis
12481036_s0	Approximately 10% of the U.S. population ingests &lt;50% of the current recommended daily allowance for zinc .	
12481036_s1	We investigate the effect of zinc deficiency on DNA damage , expression of DNA-repair enzymes , and downstream signaling events in a cell-culture model .	
12481036_s2	Low zinc inhibited cell growth of rat glioma C6 cells and increased oxidative stress .	tumor promoting inflammation
12481036_s3	Low intracellular zinc increased DNA single-strand breaks ( comet assay ) .	genomic instability and mutation
12481036_s4	Zinc-deficient C6 cells also exhibited an increase in the expression of the zinc-containing DNA-repair proteins p53 and apurinic endonuclease ( APE ) .	genomic instability and mutation
12481036_s5	Repletion with zinc restored cell growth and reversed DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
12481036_s6	APE is a multifunctional protein that not only repairs DNA but also controls DNA-binding activity of many transcription factors that may be involved in cancer progression .	
12481036_s7	The ability of the transcription factors p53 , nuclear factor kappaB , and activator protein 1 ( AP1 ) to bind to consensus DNA sequences was decreased markedly with zinc deficiency , as assayed by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays .	
12481036_s8	Thus , low intracellular zinc status causes oxidative DNA damage and induces DNA-repair protein expression , but binding of p53 and important downstream signals leading to proper DNA repair are lost without zinc .	genomic instability and mutation
12481425_s0	Ovarian hormones have a pivotal role in the control of proliferation in the mammary gland , and cumulative life-time exposure to ovarian hormones is known to be a determinant of breast cancer risk .	
12481425_s1	We have shown previously that a p.o.-active , long-acting butyrate analogue , sodium phenylbutyrate ( PB ) , reduced proliferation in normal and malignant human breast cells in culture and reduced expression of ovarian hormone receptors , suggesting that PB had cellular effects consistent with decreasing breast cancer risk .	
12481425_s2	The aim of this study was to determine the in vivo effects of PB in the normal mammary gland on epithelial cell proliferation , estrogen receptor alpha ( ER alpha ) expression , and cyclin D1 expression .	
12481425_s3	BALB/c mice were treated with PB , delivered by mini-osmotic pumps , for 7 days .	
12481425_s4	Moderate ( 250 mg/kg/day ) and high ( 500 mg/kg/day ) PB treatment resulted in a decrease in proliferation in mammary epithelial cells ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) , determined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12481425_s5	Analysis of ER alpha immunostaining revealed a significant reduction in moderate- and high-treatment groups ( P = 0.01 and P = 0.02 ) , and expression of cyclin D1 was virtually ablated ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12481425_s6	Histone deacetylase inhibition is a known mechanism of butyrate action , and consistent with this , PB increased levels of acetylated histone H3 in the mammary gland .	
12481425_s7	In summary , PB decreased proliferation in the mammary gland in vivo at clinically achievable doses .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12481425_s8	Decreased proliferation was accompanied by changes in the levels of ER alpha and cyclin D1 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12481425_s9	These data show that PB modulates parameters thought to be involved in the carcinogenic process in the normal mammary gland , and compounds in this class may therefore be useful candidates for breast cancer chemoprevention .	
12483647_s0	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE Although angiogenic factors may play an important role in the biology of neuroblastoma , which frequently spreads hematogenously , the mechanism remains unclear .	
12483647_s1	The authors studied tumor progression and invasion from the perspective of angiogenesis and sought to understand the features of this type of tumor .	
12483647_s2	METHODS Thirty-one specimens were resected from patients with neuroblastoma and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , and its receptor ( Flk-1 ) was examined using immunohistochemistry .	
12483647_s3	The authors looked for correlations among the expressions of VEGF and its receptor with various clinicopathologic factors .	
12483647_s4	In addition , they examined the expression and location of VEGF and Flk-1 mRNA in 10 primary neuroblastoma using in situ hybridization .	
12483647_s5	RESULTS Both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed the presence of VEGF expression within the neuroblastoma cells .	inducing angiogenesis
12483647_s6	We found VEGF mRNA in neuroblastoma cells but not vascular endothelial cells according to in situ hybridization .	inducing angiogenesis
12483647_s7	Further , Flk-1 mRNA was present both in neuroblastoma cells and vascular endothelial cells .	
12483647_s8	The level of VEGF expression was higher in unfavorable histology , using the criteria of Shimada , than in favorable histology .	inducing angiogenesis
12483647_s9	CONCLUSION The authors suggest that paracrine and autocrine systems are involved in the angiogenesis of neuroblastoma , and the expression of VEGF correlates with the prognosis in neuroblastoma .	inducing angiogenesis
12484029_s0	We investigated the effectiveness of continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion ( CHPP ) for the peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer .	
12484029_s1	A total 124 patients with advanced gastric cancer were enrolled in this study .	
12484029_s2	Prophylactic CHPP ( P-CHPP ) was performed in 45 patients who had macroscopic serosal invasion without peritoneal dissemination , and 79 patients without CHPP were a control group .	
12484029_s3	Therapeutic CHPP ( T-CHPP ) was performed in 21 patients with peritoneal dissemination , and 52 patients without CHPP were a control group .	
12484029_s4	There was no significant difference in 5 year survival between patients treated and not treated with P-CHPP .	
12484029_s5	Univariate analysis showed that location of tumor , tumor diameter , and lymph node metastasis influenced prognosis , but there was no prognostic factor in the Cox proportional regression hazard model .	activating invasion and metastasis
12484029_s6	There was no significant difference in 5-year survival between patients treated and not treated with T-CHPP .	
12484029_s7	Univariate analysis showed that degree of peritoneal dissemination and adjuvant chemotherapy influenced prognosis , and the Cox proportional regression hazard model showed that the macroscopic types and degree of peritoneal dissemination affected prognosis .	
12484029_s8	In the patients with CHPP , the incidences of respiratory failure and renal failure were each statistically greater than in the patients undergoing CHPP .	
12484548_s0	Ionizing radiation is a potent inducer of DNA damage because it causes single- and double-strand breaks , alkali-labile sites , base damage , and crosslinks .	
12484548_s1	The interest in ionizing radiation is due to its environmental and clinical implications .	
12484548_s2	Single-strand breaks , which are the initial damage induced by a genotoxic agent , can be used as a biomarker of exposure , whereas the more biologically relevant double-strand breaks can be analyzed to quantify the extent of damage .	
12484548_s3	In the present study the effects of 137CS gamma-radiation at doses of 1 , 5 , and 10 Gray on DNA and subsequent repair by C3H10T1/2 cells ( mouse embryo fibroblasts ) were investigated .	
12484548_s4	Two versions of the comet assay , a sensitive method for evaluating DNA damage , were implemented : the alkaline one to detect single-strand breaks , and the neutral one to identify double-strand breaks .	
12484548_s5	The results show a good linear relation between DNA damage and radiation dose , for both single-strand and double-strand breaks .	genomic instability and mutation
12484548_s6	A statistically significant difference with respect to controls was found at the lowest dose of 1 Gy .	
12484548_s7	Heterogeneity in DNA damage within the cell population was observed as a function of radiation dose .	genomic instability and mutation
12484548_s8	Repair kinetics showed that most of the damage was repaired within 2 h after irradiation , and that the highest rejoining rate occurred with the highest dose ( 10 Gy ) .	genomic instability and mutation
12484548_s9	Single-strand breaks were completely repaired 24 h after irradiation , whereas residual double-strand breaks were still present .	genomic instability and mutation
12484548_s10	This finding needs further investigation .	
12487440_s0	The effect of peptides released during the fermentation of milk on the humoral immune system and on fibrosarcoma growth was studied .	
12487440_s1	Lactobacillus helveticus was able to release peptidic compounds during milk fermentation due to its high proteolytic activity , as was shown by the degree of proteolysis and size-exclusion HPLC elution profiles .	
12487440_s2	Three fractions of these compounds were separated and fed to mice during different periods ( 2 , 5 , and 7 d ) .	
12487440_s3	The humoral immune response was assessed by following the number of IgA-secreting cells , and the antitumor activity was monitored by studying the regression of subcutaneously implanted fibrosarcomas .	
12487440_s4	Feeding during 2 and 7 d with the medium-sized fraction ( Fraction II ) significantly increased the IgA-producing cells in the intestines , whereas feeding with the large compound fraction ( Fraction I ) during 5 d and the small compound fraction ( Fraction III ) during all three feeding periods provided similar increases .	
12487440_s5	A double dose of Fraction II showed the highest IgA-producing cell count .	
12487440_s6	The increase by Fraction III was shown to be caused by the presence of L-Tryptophan .	
12487440_s7	Fraction II significantly decreased the size of fibrosarcoma when previously fed during 7 d , and feeding with Fraction I during 5 d decreased significantly its size after 35 d of growth .	
12487440_s8	Although the mechanisms by which lactic acid bacteria enhance the immune system are not clear , this study clearly shows that bioactive compounds released in fermented milks contribute to the immunoenhancing and antitumor properties of these products .	avoiding immune destruction
12487440_s9	The release of bioactive peptides by lactic acid bacteria can have important implications on the modulation of the cellular immune response .	avoiding immune destruction
12489111_s0	Food-derived heterocyclic aromatic amines ( HCAs ) have proved to be carcinogenic in both rodents and nonhuman primates .	
12489111_s1	Two different metabolic pathways are suggested for the metabolic activation of HCA .	
12489111_s2	The hepatic pathway proceeds via a two-step process involving N-hydroxylation by cytochrome P4501A2 and subsequent O-acetylation by N-acetyltransferase-2 .	
12489111_s3	An alternative pathway may be of particular interest in extrahepatic tissues and proceeds via one-electron oxidation catalyzed by prostaglandin H synthase ( PHS ) , rendering free-radical metabolites .	
12489111_s4	In this study , we investigated the metabolic activation of two HCAs , 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline ( IQ ) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ( PhIP ) , by two different enzyme systems in vitro , generating different primary and secondary reactive metabolites .	
12489111_s5	Rat liver S9 mix and PHS were used as the activating system and represent the hepatic and extrahepatic pathways , respectively .	
12489111_s6	Electron-spin resonance spectroscopy showed that both IQ and PhIP exerted inhibiting effects on PHS-mediated formation of hydroxyl radicals during the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins .	
12489111_s7	Evidence for the formation of HCA free radicals was presented in an indirect way by the formation of glutathione-derived thiyl radicals , with purified PHS as the activating system .	
12489111_s8	Activation by S9 mix did not result in the formation of detectable radical metabolites , showing that the two metabolic routes primarily led to the formation of different metabolites .	
12489111_s9	In all electron-spin resonance experiments , IQ appeared to be more effective than PhIP .	
12489111_s10	In contrasts , DNA adduct analysis by means of ( 32)P-postlabeling showed similar adduct patterns for S9 and PHS in single-stranded and double-stranded salmon testes DNA after incubation with PhIP , indicating the ultimate formation of a common reactive intermediate .	genomic instability and mutation
12489111_s11	For IQ , activation by PHS led to an additional adduct spot that was not present after S9 activation .	genomic instability and mutation
12489111_s12	Furthermore , activation of IQ resulted in higher adduct levels compared with PhIP for both activation pathways .	genomic instability and mutation
12489111_s13	Overall , adduct levels were higher in single-stranded DNA than double-stranded DNA .	genomic instability and mutation
12489111_s14	Our results showed that the hepatic and extrahepatic pathways resulted in different primary metabolites , while the ultimate formation of a similar reactive intermediate for PhIP , possibly an arylnitrenium ion , suggested that both pathways could play an important role in the onset of carcinogenesis .	
12489119_s0	Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum ( II ) ( cisplatin ) is a well characterized antitumor drug used for the treatment of a variety of human cancers .	
12489119_s1	The cytotoxicity of cisplatin is mainly mediated through the formation of DNA adducts , which are also believed to be responsible for the secondary malignancies produced by the drug .	
12489119_s2	The aim of this study was to determine the in vivo mutagenic activity of cisplatin in the lacZ plasmid-based transgenic mouse model .	
12489119_s3	The mutant frequency ( MF ) and the spectrum of mutations induced by cisplatin in the mouse liver were analyzed and compared to controls .	
12489119_s4	The mean MF in the lacZ gene was increased 2-fold in mice treated with a single 6 mg/kg body weight dose of cisplatin and sacrificed after 17 and 28 days ( P = 0.001 and P &lt ; 0.0001 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
12489119_s5	Restriction analysis and sequencing of mutant DNA showed that cisplatin was able to induce both large deletions and point mutations .	genomic instability and mutation
12489119_s6	A specific profile of base substitution and frameshift mutations was identified in treated mice , consisting primarily of G:C--&gt;A:T transitions at GpG and ApG sites , the preferential DNA binding sites of cisplatin , and single basepair deletions/insertions .	genomic instability and mutation
12489119_s7	The present results provide the first evidence that cisplatin has mutagenic activity in vivo and induces a characteristic pattern of mutations in the mouse liver .	genomic instability and mutation
12489119_s8	This mutagenicity may be responsible for its tumorigenic activity .	genomic instability and mutation
12490541_s0	Epidemiological data and animal models have provided evidence that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) have an anticancer effect .	
12490541_s1	However , the molecular mechanisms underlying these antineoplastic effects are not well understood .	
12490541_s2	We described previously that expression levels of the chemokine receptor , CCR5 , and the beta2-integrin , Mac-1 , were down-regulated on primary monocytes after incubation in supernatants from human carcinoma cell lines , and that this down-regulation resulted in impaired monocyte function with respect to migration and adhesion .	
12490541_s3	We now demonstrate that these impairments are also present in vivo .	
12490541_s4	Monocytes from cancer patients displayed significantly reduced CCR5 levels and migration capacities in comparison to cells from healthy donors .	
12490541_s5	Because migration is necessary for the antitumor activity of monocytes/macrophages , these deficits may contribute to the suppressed immune system seen in cancer patients .	avoiding immune destruction
12490541_s6	In a clinical study , we analyzed the effect of a selective COX-2 inhibitor , Rofecoxib , on the migration of monocytes derived from cancer patients .	
12490541_s7	The results revealed significant improvement in migration equal to those levels seen in healthy donors .	
12490541_s8	We conclude that in patients with cancer , the intake of Rofecoxib for 3 wk leads to significant restoration of monocyte function .	
12490541_s9	These data may , at least in part , help explain the anticancer effects of NSAIDs .	
12498392_s0	The colon carcinoma cell line CC531 is metastatic to liver after splenic injection in syngeneic rats .	activating invasion and metastasis
12498392_s1	After repeated in vivo passages , a subline was selected that produced liver metastases at a considerably higher rate than the original cell line .	activating invasion and metastasis
12498392_s2	These cells were characterized by increased intracellular glutathione , proliferation and ability to restore glutathione after exposure to oxidative stress , thus indicating an elevated resistance to oxidative stress .	tumor promoting inflammation
12498392_s3	Furthermore , the increased metastatic ability was also accompanied by increased proliferation rate , adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and endothelial cells , and secretion of a 60 kD matrix metalloproteinase .	activating invasion and metastasis
12498392_s4	When cultured in vitro for a prolonged time ( more than 30 trypsinizations ) , the cells showed a reduced in vivo metastatic ability , reduced secretion of three metalloproteinases including the 60 kD proteinase , and reduced intracellular glutathione .	activating invasion and metastasis
12498392_s5	These results indicate that metastatic ability can be influenced through several adaptive mechanisms , and that the cell's ability to resist oxidative stress and maintain intracellular glutathione are of central importance .	activating invasion and metastasis,tumor promoting inflammation
12499280_s0	Neuroblastoma ( NB ) , a common pediatric neoplasm , consists of two main cell populations : neuroblastic/ganglionic cells and Schwann cells .	
12499280_s1	NB tumors with abundant Schwannian stroma display a more benign clinical behavior than stroma-poor tumors .	
12499280_s2	Recent studies suggest that Schwann cells influence NB tumor growth via secreted factors that induce differentiation , suppress proliferation , and inhibit angiogenesis .	
12499280_s3	Two angiogenesis inhibitors , pigment epithelium-derived factor and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 , have been detected in Schwann cell secretions .	
12499280_s4	Here , we isolated another Schwann cell-derived secreted inhibitor of angiogenesis , a 43-kDa protein identified as SPARC ( secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine ) , an extracellular matrix protein .	
12499280_s5	We found SPARC to be critical for the antiangiogenic phenotype of cultured Schwann cells .	inducing angiogenesis
12499280_s6	We also show that purified SPARC potently inhibits angiogenesis and significantly impairs NB tumor growth in vivo .	inducing angiogenesis
12499280_s7	SPARC may be an effective candidate for the treatment of children with clinically aggressive , Schwannian stroma-poor NB tumors .	
12500660_s0	OBJECTIVE To design and develop a novel , sensitive and versatile method for in vivo foot printing and studies of DNA damage , such as DNA adducts and strand breaks .	
12500660_s1	METHODS Starting with mammalian genomic DNA , single-stranded products were made by repeated primer extension , these products were ligated to a double-stranded linker having a randomized 3 ' overhang , and used for PCR .	
12500660_s2	DNA breaks in p53 gene produced by restriction endonuclease AfaI were detected by using this new method followed by Southern hybridization with DIG-labeled probe .	
12500660_s3	RESULTS This randomized terminal linker-dependent PCR ( RDPCR ) method could generate band signals many-fold stronger than conventional ligation-mediated PCR ( LMPCR ) , and it was more rapid , convenient and accurate than the terminal transferase-dependent PCR ( TDPCR ) .	
12500660_s4	CONCLUSION DNA strand breakage can be detected sensitively in the gene level by RDPCR .	genomic instability and mutation
12500660_s5	Any lesion that blocks primer extension should be detectable .	
12502710_s0	DNA-protein cross-links ( DPCs ) are formed upon exposure to a variety of chemical and physical agents and pose a threat to genomic integrity .	
12502710_s1	In particular , acrolein and related aldehydes produce DPCs , although the chemical linkages for such cross-links have not been identified .	
12502710_s2	Here , we report that oligodeoxynucleotides containing 1,N(2)-deoxyguanosine adducts of acrolein , crotonaldehyde , and trans-4-hydroxynonenal can form cross-links with the tetrapeptide Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys .	genomic instability and mutation
12502710_s3	We concluded that complex formation is mediated by a Schiff base linkage because DNA-peptide complexes were covalently trapped following reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride , and pre-reduction of adducted DNAs inhibited complex formation .	genomic instability and mutation
12502710_s4	A previous NMR study demonstrated that duplex DNA catalyzes ring opening for the acrolein-derived gamma-hydroxy-1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine adduct to yield an aldehydic function ( de los Santos , C. , Zaliznyak , T. , and Johnson , F .	
12502710_s5	( 2001 ) J. Biol .	
12502710_s6	Chem. 276 , 9077-9082 ) .	
12502710_s7	Consistent with this earlier observation , the adducts under investigation were more reactive in duplex DNA than in single-stranded DNA , and we concluded that the ring-open aldehydic moiety is the induced tautomer in duplex DNA for adducts exhibiting high relative reactivity .	genomic instability and mutation
12502710_s8	Adducted DNA cross-linked to Arg-Trp-Arg-Arg and Lys-Trp-Lys-Lys with comparable efficiency , and N(alpha)-acetylation of peptides dramatically inhibited trapping ; thus , the reactive nucleophile is located at the N-terminal alpha-amine of the peptide .	genomic instability and mutation
12502710_s9	These data suggest that Schiff base chemistry can mediate DPC formation in vivo following the formation of stable aldehyde-derived DNA adducts .	genomic instability and mutation
12504222_s0	Recent studies indicate that cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) is overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and may play a critical role in this rapidly progressing form of cancer .	
12504222_s1	A human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line , Mia PaCa-2 , was incubated for 18 hours with 5 micromol/L of rofecoxib ( Vioxx ) , a selective COX-2 inhibitor .	
12504222_s2	Total RNA was isolated and gene expression analyzed by DNA microarray chips .	
12504222_s3	In a separate experiment , athymic mice were orthotopically injected with 7.5 x 10(5) Mia PaCa-2 cells through a minilaparotomy .	
12504222_s4	After 1 month , laparotomy was repeated to measure tumor size , and mice were randomized to receive reformulated rodent chow containing either 12.5 mg/kg/day of rofecoxib or no drug for 21 days .	
12504222_s5	Tumor growth was assessed by comparing volume before and after treatment .	
12504222_s6	In vitro , rofecoxib decreased gene expression of cyclin D1/PRAD1 , a key component of cell cycle progression , while increasing expression of several cell cycle arrest genes , including p21/WAF1 , p33/ING , GADD34 , and GADD45 ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12504222_s7	In vivo , tumor growth was significantly reduced in treated vs. control mice ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
12504222_s8	No systemic toxicity was observed in mice receiving rofecoxib .	
12504222_s9	These data suggest that rofecoxib slows the growth of human pancreatic cancer through changes in gene expression that favor cell cycle arrest .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12505357_s0	Several members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family play key roles in recognising and responding to damage in DNA , induced by a variety of chemicals and other agents .	
12505357_s1	One of these , ATM , the product of the gene mutated in the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) , recognises double strand breaks in DNA caused by ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals .	
12505357_s2	In order to study DNA damage recognition and the abnormalities of genome instability and cancer predisposition that occur in A-T patients , we generated a mouse model expressing a mutant form of Atm corresponding to a common human mutation .	genomic instability and mutation
12505357_s3	In this model , a 9 nucleotide in-frame deletion was introduced into the Atm gene and has been designated Atm-Delta SRI .	genomic instability and mutation
12505357_s4	These animals had a longer lifespan than Atm gene disrupted mice ( Atm(-/-) ) and they developed less thymic lymphomas .	
12505357_s5	A characteristic of the lymphomas appearing in Atm-Delta SRI mice was an increased rate of apoptosis compared to the corresponding tumours in Atm(-/-) mice .	resisting cell death
12505357_s6	Increased expression of FasL in these tumours may account for the higher levels of apoptosis .	resisting cell death
12505357_s7	These results demonstrate that expression of mutant Atm in mice gives rise to phenotypic differences compared to Atm(-/-) mice and has implications for heterogeneity described in the human syndrome .	
12507933_s0	Human esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) develops in a sequence from gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , columnar-lined esophagus ( CLE ) , dysplasia , and eventually to EAC .	
12507933_s1	We established a rat surgical EAC model with esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis ( EGDA ) to mimic the staged process of esophageal adenocarcinogenesis .	
12507933_s2	Profiling of the AA metabolites with mass spectrometry showed that prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) , 15-hydroeicosatetraenoic acid ( HETE ) , 12-HETE , 8-HETE and 5-HETE all increased at the esophagoduodenal junction after EGDA as compared with the proximal esophagus , with PGE2 as the major metabolite .	
12507933_s3	Consistent with this profile , cyclooxygenase 2 ( Cox2 ) was overexpressed in the basal cell layer of esophageal squamous epithelium , CLE cells and EAC tumor cells of the EGDA rats , as compared with the normal esophageal epithelium .	
12507933_s4	Sulindac ( a Cox inhibitor ) , nordihydroguaiaretic acid ( NDGA , a lipoxygenase inhibitor ) and alpha-difluoromethylornithine ( DFMO , an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor ) were tested for their possible inhibitory actions against the formation of EAC in the rat EGDA model .	
12507933_s5	In a short-term study ( for 4 weeks after surgery ) , dietary administration of both sulindac ( 300 and 600 p.p.m. ) and NDGA ( 100 p.p.m. ) effectively reduced the EGDA-induced inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
12507933_s6	In a long-term chemoprevention study ( for 40 weeks after surgery ) , 300 p.p.m. sulindac , alone or in combination with 100 p.p.m .	
12507933_s7	NDGA or 0.5% DFMO , decreased the tumor incidence from 57.7 to 26.9% , or 16.7 or 20% , respectively ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
12507933_s8	NDGA alone ( 100 and 200 p.p.m. ) slightly decreased the tumor incidence to 52.4 and 37% , respectively , although the difference was not statistically significant .	
12507933_s9	DFMO alone did not show significant effects on tumor incidence .	
12507933_s10	Inhibition of tumor formation by sulindac was correlated with lowered levels of PGE2 .	
12507933_s11	In conclusion , sulindac exerted its chemopreventive effect against the formation of EAC in the rat EGDA model possibly through its inhibition of Cox .	
12507935_s0	To examine the association of cell cycle regulatory gene inactivation with human cell immortalization , we determined the expression status of INK4a , Rb , and WAF1/ CIP1 , in eleven in vitro immortalized human cell lines , including fibroblasts and keratinocytes .	
12507935_s1	Two human papillomavirus type 16 E6 expressing cell lines with telomerase activity , including a fibroblast cell line and a keratinocyte cell line , expressed no detectable p16(INK4a) .	
12507935_s2	These cell lines had a hyperphosphorylated pRb and reduced expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) .	
12507935_s3	All of seven fibroblast cell lines immortalized either spontaneously or by ( 60)Co , X-rays , 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide or aflatoxin B(1) , maintaining their telomeres by the ALT ( alternative lengthening of telomeres ) pathway , displayed loss of expression of p16(INK4a) and hyperphosphorylation of pRb .	enabling replicative immortality
12507935_s4	Levels of p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression varied among the cell lines .	
12507935_s5	Two fibroblast cell lines that became immortalized following infection with a retrovirus vector encoding human telomerase catalytic subunit ( hTERT ) cDNA were also accompanied by inactivation of p16(INK4a) and pRb pathways .	enabling replicative immortality
12507935_s6	Acquisition of telomerase activity alone was not sufficient for immortalization of these cell lines .	enabling replicative immortality
12507935_s7	Taken together , all the cell lines including fibroblasts and keratinocytes , with either telomerase activity or the ALT pathway for telomere maintenance showed loss of expression of p16(INK4a) and hyperphosphorylation of pRb .	
12507935_s8	These demonstrate the association of inactivation of both p16(INK4a) and pRb with immortalization of human cells including fibroblasts and epithelial cells and telomerase-positive cells and ALT-positive cells .	enabling replicative immortality
12508545_s0	It was proved that nuclear factor-kappa B play an important role in the activation of immune cell , anti-virus , various stress reaction , and regulation of apoptosis , etc .	avoiding immune destruction,resisting cell death
12508545_s1	The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of NF-kappa B signal-transduction pathway on apoptosis of hepatic carcinoma cell line-7721 induced by TNF-alpha .	
12509233_s0	The xeroderma pigmentosum group C ( XPC ) protein specifically involved in genome-wide damage recognition for nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) was purified as a tight complex with HR23B , one of the two mammalian homologs of RAD23 in budding yeast .	
12509233_s1	This XPC-HR23B complex exhibits strong binding affinity for single-stranded DNA , as well as preferential binding to various types of damaged DNA .	
12509233_s2	To examine the structure-function relationship of XPC , a series of truncated mutant proteins were generated and assayed for various binding activities .	
12509233_s3	The two domains participating in binding to HR23B and damaged DNA , respectively , were mapped within the carboxy-terminal half of XPC , which also contains an evolutionary conserved amino acid sequence homologous to the yeast RAD4 protein .	
12509233_s4	We established that the carboxy-terminal 125 amino acids are dispensable for both HR23B and damaged DNA binding , while interactions with transcription factor IIH ( TFIIH ) are significantly impaired by truncation of this domain .	genomic instability and mutation
12509233_s5	Furthermore , deletion of the extreme carboxy-terminal domain totally abolished XPC activity in the cell-free NER reaction .	
12509233_s6	These results suggest that following initial damage recognition , the carboxy terminus of XPC may be essential for the recruitment of TFIIH , and that most truncation mutations identified in XP-C patients result in non-functional proteins .	genomic instability and mutation
12509290_s0	Many different cellular pathways have evolved to protect the genome from the deleterious effects of DNA damage that result from exposure to chemical and physical agents .	
12509290_s1	Among these is a process called transcription-coupled repair ( TCR ) that catalyzes the removal of DNA lesions from the transcribed strand of expressed genes , often resulting in a preferential bias of damage clearance from this strand relative to its non-transcribed counterpart .	
12509290_s2	Lesions subject to this type of repair include cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers that are normally repaired by nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and thymine glycols ( TGs ) that are removed primarily by base excision repair ( BER ) .	
12509290_s3	While the mechanism underlying TCR is not completely clear , it is known that its facilitation requires proteins used by other repair pathways like NER .	
12509290_s4	It is also believed that the signal for TCR is the stalled RNA polymerase that results when DNA damage prevents its translocation during transcription elongation .	
12509290_s5	While there is a clear role for some NER proteins in TCR , the involvement of BER proteins is less clear .	
12509290_s6	To explore this further , we studied the removal of 7-methylguanine ( 7MeG ) and 3-methyladenine ( 3MeA ) from the dihydrofolate reductase ( dhfr ) gene of murine cell lines that vary in their repair phenotypes. 7MeG and 3MeA constitute the two principal N-methylpurines formed in DNA following exposure to methylating agents .	
12509290_s7	In mammalian cells , alkyladenine DNA alkyladenine glycosylase ( Aag ) is the major enzyme required for the repair of these lesions via BER , and their removal from the total genome is quite rapid .	genomic instability and mutation
12509290_s8	There is no observable TCR of these lesions in specific genes in DNA repair proficient cells ; however , it is possible that the rapid repair of these adducts by BER masks any TCR .	genomic instability and mutation
12509290_s9	The repair of 3MeA and 7MeG was examined in cells lacking Aag , NER , or both Aag and NER to determine if rapid overall repair masks TCR .	
12509290_s10	The results show that both 3MeA and 7MeG are removed without strand bias from the dhfr gene of BER deficient ( Aag deficient ) and NER deficient murine cell lines .	genomic instability and mutation
12509290_s11	Furthermore , repair of 3MeA in this region is highly dependent on Aag , but repair of 7MeG is equally efficient in the repair proficient , BER deficient , and NER deficient cell lines .	genomic instability and mutation
12509290_s12	Strikingly , in the absence of both BER and NER , neither 7MeG nor 3MeA is repaired .	genomic instability and mutation
12509290_s13	These results demonstrate that NER , but not TCR , contributes to the repair of 7MeG , and to a lesser extent 3MeA .	genomic instability and mutation
12509295_s0	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Mre11p , Rad50p , and Xrs2p function as a multiprotein complex that has a central role in several DNA repair mechanisms .	
12509295_s1	Though Mre11p has both single-stranded and double-stranded 3'-5 ' exonuclease activity in vitro , null mutants of MRE11 , RAD50 , and XRS2 exhibit reduced 5'-3 ' resection of HO-induced double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in vivo .	
12509295_s2	In this study , we analyzed four mre11 mutants harboring changes in the N-terminus of Mre11p where the four phosphoesterase motifs specify the in vitro nuclease activities of Mre11p and its homologues .	
12509295_s3	We find that the 5'-3 ' resection defects in vivo do not correlate with several mitotic phenotypes : non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) , telomere length maintenance , and adaptation to the DNA damage-inducible G2/M checkpoint .	genomic instability and mutation
12509295_s4	Overexpression of the 5'-3 ' exonuclease Exo1p in a mre11Delta strain partially increased 5'-3 ' resection and partially suppressed both methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) hypersensitivity and adaptation phenotypes , but did not affect telomere length or NHEJ .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
12509295_s5	Surprisingly , the co-expression of two alleles , mre11-58S and mre11-N113S , each of which confers MMS hypersensitivity and short telomeres , can fully complement the MMS sensitivity and shortened telomere length of mre11Delta cells .	
12509295_s6	We propose that at least two separate activities associated with the N-terminus of Mre11p are required for its mitotic function .	
12513759_s0	To explore the possibility of a new therapeutic strategy for leukemia by intervening in the DNA methylation to re-express p15 suppressor gene , methylation inhibitors , 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5-Aza-CdR ) and cell differentiation agent ( CDAII ) were used to treat myelogenous leukemia cell line KG1a in which p15 gene expression was suppressed due to DNA hypermethylation .	
12513759_s1	The biological characteristics of KG1a cells untreated or treated with the agents were investigated and analyzed using morphology , methylation specific-PCR ( MSP ) , ( 3)H-labeled microassay technique , restriction endonuclease reaction , flow cytometry and immunofluorescence methods .	
12513759_s2	The results indicated that both agents showed concentration-dependent and time-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. 5-Aza-CdR and CDAII induced apoptosis and cell differentiation with G(2) and G(0)/G(1) arrest respectively .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
12513759_s3	Furthermore , DNA methyltransferase activity and level of methylation in genomic DNA were decreased and p15 protein was re-expressed partially .	
12513759_s4	It is concluded that it is possible to treat leukemia by intervening in the DNA methylation using methyltransferase inhibitors and it is worth to make a thorough study on mechanism of the new strategy .	
12513808_s0	The purpose of this investigation was to study the variation of p73 gene expression in the apoptotic process of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell line U937 induced by methotrexate ( MTX ) .	
12513808_s1	Morphological changes of apoptotic cells were observed with microscopy and Wright's + Giemsa staining .	resisting cell death
12513808_s2	DNA ladder and cell cycle were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry respectively .	
12513808_s3	Using semi-quantitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , the expression of p73 mRNA was examined .	
12513808_s4	Results showed that MTX could induce U937 cell apoptosis effectively .	resisting cell death
12513808_s5	Condensed nuclei , fragmentation of chromosome and DNA ladder were seen after 6 hour following treatment of MTX 5 micro mol/L .	resisting cell death
12513808_s6	Sub-G(1) peak and S + G(2)/M arrest were also determined by FCM , but the quantity of p73 expression was generally constant .	
12513808_s7	In conclusion , U937 cell apoptosis induced by MTX did not change p73 mRNA level .	resisting cell death
12518062_s0	Free radical-induced cellular stress contributes to cancer during chronic inflammation .	
12518062_s1	Here , we investigated mechanisms of p53 activation by the free radical , NO .	
12518062_s2	NO from donor drugs induced both ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM)- and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related-dependent p53 posttranslational modifications , leading to an increase in p53 transcriptional targets and a G(2)M cell cycle checkpoint .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
12518062_s3	Such modifications were also identified in cells cocultured with NO-releasing macrophages .	
12518062_s4	In noncancerous colon tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis ( a cancer-prone chronic inflammatory disease ) , inducible NO synthase protein levels were positively correlated with p53 serine 15 phosphorylation levels .	
12518062_s5	Immunostaining of HDM-2 and p21(WAF1) was consistent with transcriptionally active p53 .	
12518062_s6	Our study highlights a pivotal role of NO in the induction of cellular stress and the activation of a p53 response pathway during chronic inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
12521324_s0	Adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) of the salivary glands is a highly infiltrative malignant tumour with a tendency for lung metastasis .	
12521324_s1	Gene therapy could be a potentially effective therapy for ACC and its metastasis .	
12521324_s2	The aims of the study were : To transduce interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) gene into an ACC cell line with predisposition for lung metastasis ( ACC-M ) ; to compare the bioactivity of the gene-transduced cells and the parent cell line in vitro and in vivo .	
12521324_s3	The IL-2 gene was transduced via a bicistronic retroviral vector into the ACC-M cells .	
12521324_s4	The growth rate and DNA cell cycles of the parent ACC-M , the control viral vector AmGCEN , and the gene transduced AmIL-2 cell cultures were compared quantitatively and by flow cytometry , respectively .	
12521324_s5	The tumourigenic ability of the three cell lines was verified by inoculation in athymic nude mice .	
12521324_s6	The tumours developed were extracted and compared quantitatively and histologically .	
12521324_s7	There was no difference in the growth rate and the DNA count between the ACC-M , AmGCEN , and AmIL-2 cell cultures .	
12521324_s8	In the animal experiment , both the ACC-M and AmGCEN cells stimulated lung metastasis in all the mice , whereas there was no tumour found in the 1 x 10(6) AmIL-2 cells inoculation .	activating invasion and metastasis
12521324_s9	On 3 x 10(6) AmIL-2 cells stimulation , three out of six mice developed tumours but the mass and volume of the tumours were smaller than the other two groups .	
12521324_s10	Under light microscopy , the ACC-M tumours were mainly poorly differentiated with minimal cellular matrix , whereas the AmIL-2 tumours were well differentiated with ample matrix .	
12521324_s11	The transduction of IL-2 gene can reduce the tumourigenicity of ACC-M cells and induces tumour cell differentiation in mice .	
12521324_s12	The IL-2 gene can be a potential effective gene for the treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary glands and its lung metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
12522551_s0	DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) is the process by which incorrectly paired DNA nucleotides are recognized and repaired .	
12522551_s1	A germline mutation in one of the genes involved in the process may be responsible for a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome , hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer .	
12522551_s2	Cancer progression in predisposed individuals results from the somatic inactivation of the normal copy of the MMR gene , leading to a mutator phenotype affecting preferentially repeat sequences ( microsatellite instability , MSI ) .	
12522551_s3	Recently , we identified children with a constitutional deficiency of MMR activity attributable to a mutation in the h MLH1 gene .	
12522551_s4	These children exhibited a constitutional genetic instability associated with clinical features of de novo neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) and early onset of extracolonic cancer .	
12522551_s5	Based on these observations , we hypothesized that somatic NF1 gene mutation was a frequent and possibly early event in MMR-deficient cells .	
12522551_s6	To test this hypothesis , we screened for NF1 mutations in cancer cells .	
12522551_s7	Genetic alterations were identified in five out of ten tumor cell lines with MSI , whereas five MMR-proficient tumor cell lines expressed a wild-type NF1 gene .	
12522551_s8	Somatic NF1 mutations were also detected in two primary tumors exhibiting an MSI phenotype .	genomic instability and mutation
12522551_s9	Finally , a 35-bp deletion in the murine Nf1 coding region was identified in mlh1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts .	
12522551_s10	These observations demonstrate that the NF1 gene is a mutational target of MMR deficiency and suggest that its inactivation is an important step of the malignant progression of MMR-deficient cells .	genomic instability and mutation
12528894_s0	IL-16 is a ligand and chemotactic factor for CD4+ T cells .	
12528894_s1	IL-16 inhibits the CD3 mediated lymphocyte activation and proliferation .	
12528894_s2	The effects of IL-16 on the target cells are dependent on the cell type , the presence of co-activators etc .	
12528894_s3	To understand the regulation function and mechanism of IL-16 on target cells , we used a 130 a.a. recombinant IL-16 to study its effects on the growth of Jurkat T leukemia cells in vitro .	
12528894_s4	We found that the rIL-16 stimulated the proliferation of Jurkat cells at low dose ( 10(-9)M ) , but inhibited the growth of the cells at higher concentration ( 10(-5)M ) .	
12528894_s5	Results showed that 10(-5) M of rIL-16 treatment induced an enhanced apoptosis in Jurkat cells .	resisting cell death
12528894_s6	The treatment blocked the expression of FasL , but up-regulated the c-myc and Bid expression in the cells .	resisting cell death
12528894_s7	Pre-treatment of PKC inhibitor or MEK1 inhibitor markedly increased or decreased the rIL-16 induced growth-inhibiting effects on Jurkat cells , respectively .	
12528894_s8	The results suggested that the rIL-16 might be a regulator for the growth or apoptosis of Jurkat cells at a dose-dependent manner .	resisting cell death
12528894_s9	The growth-inhibiting effects of rIL-16 might be Fas/FasL independent , but , associated with the activation of PKC , up-regulated expression of c-Myc and Bid , and the participation of the ERK signal pathway in Jurkat cells .	
12530080_s0	The triterpenoid fraction ( 100 and 200 mg/kg ) of the fruit bodies of Ganoderma lucidum inhibited primary solid-tumor growth in the spleen , liver metastasis and secondary metastatic tumor growth in the liver in intrasplenic Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC)-implanted mice .	activating invasion and metastasis
12530080_s1	In addition , the triterpenoid fraction ( 800 micrograms/mL ) inhibited angiogenesis induced by Matrigel ( a soluble basement membrane extract of the Engelbreth-Holm-Swam ( EHS ) tumor ) supplemented with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and heparin in an in vivo model .	inducing angiogenesis
12530080_s2	This suggested that the antitumor and antimetastatic activities of the triterpenoid fraction of G. lucidum might be due to the inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
12530080_s3	Next , we attempted to isolate the active substance(s) using the in vivo assay system of Matrigel-induced angiogenesis .	
12530080_s4	The acidic fraction of the triterpenoid fraction inhibited the Matrigel-induced angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
12530080_s5	Compound I was isolated from the acidic fraction as an active substance that inhibited the Martigel-induced angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
12530080_s6	Compound I was identified as ganoderic acid F based on the data of IR , 1H- and 13C-NMR and MS analyses .	
12530531_s0	Despite experimental evidence that sulforaphane can exert chemopreventive effects , whether these effects are specific for neoplastic cells is not known .	
12530531_s1	Following our previous demonstration that sulforaphane induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human T lymphoblastoid Jurkat leukemia cells and increases p53 and bax protein expression , we tested sulforaphane on non-transformed phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes .	
12530531_s2	Here , we demonstrate that sulforaphane arrested cell cycle progression in G , phase , through a decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D3 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12530531_s3	Moreover , sulforaphane induced apoptosis ( and also necrosis ) , mediated by an increase in the expression of p53 .	resisting cell death
12530531_s4	These findings suggest that sulforaphane is a growth modulator for T cells .	
12530531_s5	Our in vitro evidence that sulforaphane is active and even cytotoxic in normal as well as transformed lymphocytes raises important questions regarding its suitability for cancer chemoprevention .	
12530607_s0	Glycol ethers are known reproductive and developmental toxins in laboratory animals , but little is known about their genotoxic effects in humans .	
12530607_s1	In the current article , the authors tested the hypothesis that human in utero exposure to ethylene glycol monomethyl ether ( EGME ) is associated with the development of specific congenital anomalies and elevated levels of chromosome aberrations .	
12530607_s2	The authors conducted a clinical and cytogenetic evaluation of 41 offspring of 28 females occupationally exposed to EGME for an average duration of 4.6 yr .	
12530607_s3	Six offspring of 5 women who were occupationally exposed to EGME during pregnancy exhibited characteristic dysmorphic features that were not observed in 35 offspring of 23 women who worked in the same facility , but who were not pregnant at the time of exposure .	
12530607_s4	Persistent cytogenetic damage was observed exclusively in all 6 in-utero-exposed offspring , but not in their 12 match non-in-utero-exposed controls .	genomic instability and mutation
12530607_s5	The study characterizes EGME as a human teratogen , as indicated by the prevalence of characteristic dysmorphic features and persistent cytogenetic damage in individuals exposed in utero to this chemical .	genomic instability and mutation
12531010_s0	DNA polymerases beta ( pol beta ) and eta ( pol eta ) are the only two eukaryotic polymerases known to efficiently bypass cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts in vitro .	
12531010_s1	Frameshift errors are an important aspect of mutagenesis .	
12531010_s2	We have compared the types of frameshifts that occur during translesion synthesis past cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts in vitro by pol beta and pol eta on a template containing multiple runs of nucleotides flanking a single platinum-GG adduct .	
12531010_s3	Translesion synthesis past platinum adducts by pol beta resulted in approximately 50% replication products containing single-base deletions .	
12531010_s4	For both adducts the majority of -1 frameshifts occurred in a TTT sequence 3-5 bp upstream of the DNA lesion .	genomic instability and mutation
12531010_s5	For pol eta , all of the bypass products for both cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts contained -1 frameshifts in the upstream TTT sequence and most of the products of replication on oxaliplatin-damaged templates had multiple replication errors , both frameshifts and misinsertions .	genomic instability and mutation
12531010_s6	In addition , on platinated templates both polymerases generated replication products 4-8 bp shorter than the full-length products .	
12531010_s7	The majority of short cisplatin-induced products contained an internal deletion which included the adduct .	genomic instability and mutation
12531010_s8	In contrast , the majority of oxaliplatin-induced short products contained a 3 ' terminal deletion .	genomic instability and mutation
12531010_s9	The implications of these in vitro results for in vivo mutagenesis are discussed .	genomic instability and mutation
12531020_s0	Mice defective in the mismatch repair ( MMR ) gene Msh2 manifest an enhanced predisposition to skin cancer associated with exposure to UVB radiation .	
12531020_s1	This predisposition is further heightened if the mice are additionally defective for the nucleotide excision repair gene Xpc .	
12531020_s2	To test the hypothesis that the predisposition of Msh2 mutant mice to skin cancer reflects a mutator phenotype associated with increased proliferation of skin cells following exposure to UV radiation , Msh2 mutant mice were exposed to the tumor promoter TPA .	
12531020_s3	Such mice showed a robust proliferative response in the skin , but did not manifest evidence of dysplasia or neoplasia .	
12531020_s4	We conclude that the predisposition of Msh2 mice to UVB radiation-induced skin cancer reflects an interaction between the processes of mismatch repair and some other excision repair mode , the exact nature of which remains to be established .	genomic instability and mutation
12533046_s0	Arsenic trioxide ( ATO ) is a novel agent to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) .	
12533046_s1	ATO can degrade chimeric PML-RAR proteins and induce apoptosis in various cancer cells .	
12533046_s2	However , its effects on primary hematopoietic CD34+ have not been examined .	
12533046_s3	In this study , we compared the effects of ATO on HL60 leukemic cells and primary umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) CD34+ cells .	
12533046_s4	HL60 cells and UCB CD34+ cells were cultured with different concentrations of ATO for up to three weeks and examined for changes of cell cycle .	
12533046_s5	We found that ATO ( &lt ; or = 5 microM ) caused prolongation of G1/S and G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12533046_s6	The percentage of cells in G2/M increased significantly ( from 8.6 to 53.8% ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12533046_s7	High-dose ATO ( &gt ; or = 25 microM ) caused non-specific cell death in HL60 cells without any changes in cell cycle .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
12533046_s8	In contrast to HL60 cells , UCB CD34+ cells were more resistant to high-dose ATO and most ATO-resistant CD34+ cells remained in G0/G1 phase .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12533046_s9	Primary cells that were resistant to ATO were rich in CD34+ cells .	
12533046_s10	We further show that the ATO resistance was not related to the expression of P-glycoprotein ( MDR-1 ) .	
12533046_s11	Our results suggest that the resistance to ATO in primitive UCB CD34+ cells is most likely related to its cell-cycle status .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12533046_s12	These results could be useful to design treatments for non-APL malignancies and to enrich hematopoietic stem cells in clinically applicable settings .	
12533744_s0	Vanadium pentoxide , commercially the most important compound of vanadium , presents a potential occupational hazard during the cleaning of oil-fired boilers and furnaces , the handling of catalysts , and during the refining , processing , or burning of vanadium-rich mineral ores or fossil fuels .	
12533744_s1	Vanadium pentoxide was nominated for study by the National Cancer Institute as a representative of the metals class study .	
12533744_s2	Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to vanadium pentoxide ( 99% pure ) by inhalation for 16 days , 14 weeks , or 2 years .

12533744_s8	Lavage fluid analysis indicated an inflammatory response in the lung that was either directly mediated by vanadium pentoxide or was secondary to lung damage induced by vanadium pentoxide exposure. 16-DAY STUDY IN MICE : Groups of five male and five female mice were exposed to particulate aerosols of vanadium pentoxide at concentrations of 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , or 32 mg/m(3) by inhalation , 6 hours per day , 5 days per week for 16 days .	tumor promoting inflammation
12533744_s9	All males exposed to 32 mg/m(3) and one 8 mg/m(3) male died or were killed moribund before the end of the study .	
12533744_s10	Mean body weights of 16 mg/m(3) males and 8 mg/m(3) or greater females were significantly less than those of the chamber controls , and the 32 mg/m(3) females lost weight during the study .	
12533744_s11	Absolute and relative lung weights of 4 mg/m(3) or greater males and all exposed groups of females and liver weights of 16 mg/m(3) males were significantly greater than those of the chamber controls .	
12533744_s12	The mediastinal lymph nodes were enlarged in 4 , 8 , and 16 mg/m(3) males and females , and lymphoid hyperplasia was confirmed histologically .	
12533744_s13	Lavage fluid analysis indicated an inflammatory response in the lung that was either directly mediated by vanadium pentoxide or was secondary to lung damage induced by vanadium pentoxide exposure. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS : Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to particulate aerosols of vanadium pentoxide at concentrations of 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , or 16 mg/m(3) by inhalation , 6 hours per day , 5 days per week for 3 months .	tumor promoting inflammation

12533744_s16	Abnormal breathing , thinness , lethargy , abnormal posture , and ruffled fur were observed in rats exposed to 16 mg/m(3) .	
12533744_s17	Hematology results indicated that exposure of rats to vanadium pentoxide induced a microcytic erythrocytosis in males and females .	
12533744_s18	Absolute and relative lung weights were significantly greater for 4 mg/m(3) or greater males and females than for the chamber controls as were the relative lung weights of 2 mg/m(3) males .	
12533744_s19	The estrous cycle of females exposed to 8 mg/m(3) was significantly longer than that of the chamber control group , and the number of cycling females in the 16 mg/m(3) group was reduced .

12536237_s0	An efficent antitumor and antiviral cellular immune response requires optimal interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) secretion and perforin expression in CD8(+) T cells .	
12536237_s1	The aim of this study was to define whether CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from patients with undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type ( UCNT ) , a tumor regularly associated with the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , have abnormal phenotype profiles , cytokine production , perforin and CD3-zeta expressions .	
12536237_s2	Our data showed that CD4 and CD8 subset distribution was not grossly altered in the peripheral blood of UCNT patients , while tumor biopsies contained an increased proportion of CD8(+) T cells .	avoiding immune destruction
12536237_s3	The analysis of the CD4(+) subset showed a defect in interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) production and a moderate increase of IL-10 production , a situation consistent with a Th1/Th2 imbalance .	avoiding immune destruction
12536237_s4	We have also demonstrated that CD8(+) lymphocytes from UCNT patients had a marked impairment of IFN-gamma secretion and perforin expression .	avoiding immune destruction
12536237_s5	This impairment was not related to the presence of detectable EBV DNA in the plasma .	
12536237_s6	In UCNT patients , the blockade of the perforin pathway and of IFN-gamma production may constitute important mechanisms for immune escape by the tumor and for impaired control of EBV replication .	
12537564_s0	BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a leading cause of death worldwide .	
12537564_s1	Frequent cytogenetic abnormalities that occur in HCC suggest that tumor-modifying genes ( oncogenes or tumor suppressors ) may be driving selection for amplification or deletion of these particular genetic regions .	
12537564_s2	In many cases , however , the gene(s) that drive the selection are unknown .	
12537564_s3	Although techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) have traditionally been used to identify cytogenetic aberrations , it might also be possible to identify them indirectly from gene-expression studies .	
12537564_s4	A technique we have called comparative genomic microarray analysis ( CGMA ) predicts regions of cytogenetic change by searching for regional gene-expression biases .	
12537564_s5	CGMA was applied to HCC gene-expression profiles to identify regions of frequent cytogenetic change and to identify genes whose expression is misregulated within these regions .	
12537564_s6	RESULTS Using CGMA , 104 HCC gene-expression microarray profiles were analyzed .	
12537564_s7	CGMA identified 13 regions of frequent cytogenetic change in the HCC samples .	genomic instability and mutation
12537564_s8	Ten of these regions have been detected in previous CGH studies ( +lq , -4q , +6p , -8p , +8q , -13q , -16q , -17p , +17q , +20q ) .	
12537564_s9	CGMA identified three additional regions that have not been previously identified by CGH ( +5q , +12q , +19p ) .	
12537564_s10	Genes located in regions of frequent cytogenetic change were examined for changed expression in the HCC samples .	
12537564_s11	CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that CGMA predictions using gene-expression microarray datasets are a practical alternative to CGH profiling .	
12537564_s12	In addition , CGMA might be useful for identifying candidate genes within cytogenetically abnormal regions .	genomic instability and mutation
12541019_s0	PURPOSE Although the adrenal gland is a common site of extrahepatic metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , there are no definitive guidelines for the treatment of adrenal metastasis .	
12541019_s1	This study examines the effectiveness of various treatments for this disease .	
12541019_s2	METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 20 patients treated for adrenal metastasis of HCC by adrenalectomy ( n = 13 ) , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , or percutaneous ethanol injection therapy ( PEIT ) ( n = 7 ) .	
12541019_s3	RESULTS There were no significant differences in cumulative survival rates between patients given adrenalectomy and those given TACE or PEIT , either after completing treatment for primary HCC or after the first treatment for adrenal metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
12541019_s4	Six of seven patients with tumor thrombi in the inferior vena cava ( IVC ) from adrenal metastasis underwent adrenalectomy combined with intracaval thrombectomy , five of whom survived for more than 1 year after surgery , and two of whom are still alive without any recurrence more than 3 years after surgery .	activating invasion and metastasis
12541019_s5	PEIT showed good results for small adrenal metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
12541019_s6	CONCLUSION These findings suggest that therapeutic modalities should be chosen according to the clinical features of each individual , including the size of the metastatic tumor , whether there is invasion into the IVC , the function of the remaining liver , and the existence of intra- and/or nonadrenal extrahepatic lesions .	activating invasion and metastasis
12541019_s7	Furthermore , intracaval tumor thrombectomy could be indicated for patients with IVC thrombus if they are suitable candidates for surgery .	
12548019_s0	Polo-like kinase 3 ( Plk3 , alternatively termed Prk ) is involved in the regulation of DNA damage checkpoint as well as in M-phase function .	
12548019_s1	Plk3 physically interacts with p53 and phosphorylates this tumor suppressor protein on serine-20 , suggesting that the role of Plk3 in cell cycle progression is mediated , at least in part , through direct regulation of p53 .	
12548019_s2	Here we show that Plk3 is rapidly activated by reactive oxygen species in normal diploid fibroblast cells ( WI-38 ) , correlating with a subsequent increase in p53 protein level .	tumor promoting inflammation
12548019_s3	Plk3 physically interacts with Chk2 and the interaction is enhanced upon DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
12548019_s4	In addition , Chk2 immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of Daudi ( which expressed little Plk3 ) is capable of stimulating the kinase activity of purified recombinant Plk3 in vitro , and this stimulation is more pronounced when Plk3 is supplemented with Chk2 immunoprecipitated from Daudi after DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
12548019_s5	Furthermore , ectopic expression Chk2 activates cellular Plk3 .	genomic instability and mutation

12549857_s1	In order to obtain large quantities of cells and reproducibility , human endothelial cells with extended life spans were developed by retroviral transfection .	
12549857_s2	The resulting cells grown in a serum-free medium containing endothelial cell growth supplement ( ECGS ) have a telomerase activity , extended life spans of at least 21 passages , and an endothelial cell phenotype ( diI-acetylated-LDL upake , factor VIII-related antigen , VEGFR-1 and R-2 , and tissue-type plasminogen activator ( tPA) ) that resembled that of unaltered primary endothelial cells .	inducing angiogenesis
12549857_s3	Exceptions were ( i ) a higher expression of tPA , and ( ii ) a non-significant growth response to FGF-2 or VEGF stimulation .	inducing angiogenesis
12549857_s4	Within three-dimensional fibrin gels , specific cell clones rapidly formed tubular structures in a more reproducible manner than those observed with low-passage primary cells .	
12549857_s5	Tube formation by primary endothelial cells and those with extended life spans was dependent upon FGF-2 and ECGS , respectively .	
12549857_s6	Both cell types produced FGF-2 and VEGF cytokines .	inducing angiogenesis
12549857_s7	Increasing doses of suramin significantly decreased the size of microvessels formed by both cell lines .	inducing angiogenesis
12549857_s8	These functional results indicate that a vascular matrix system containing human cells with extended life spans can be successfully utilized as an in vitro assay for antiangiogenic compounds .	inducing angiogenesis
12553047_s0	The effects of glucocorticoid ( GC ) on the proliferation of Dunn Osteosarcoma ( OS ) cells were examined under in vitro culture conditions .	
12553047_s1	Dexamethasone ( Dex ) inhibited the proliferation of Dunn OS cells in a dose-dependent manner , while the addition of anti-GC , RU486 , to the culture medium in part recovered Dex-induced growth inhibition .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12553047_s2	The number of maximum binding sites ( Bmax ) and the dissociation constant ( Kd ) value of glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) in Dunn OS cells were 19,560 sites/cell and 5.2 +/- 0.8 nM , respectively .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12553047_s3	RU486 competed with labeled Dex against GR at a concentration of 10(-6) M. Western blot analysis of [ 3H]Dex-mesylate-labeled cell homogenate and immunohistochemical staining against GR further confirmed the presence of GR .	
12553047_s4	Dex treatment of Dunn OS cells resulted in apoptosis with the characteristic internucleosomal DNA cleavage shown by the DNA ladder pattern in agarose gel electrophoresis .	resisting cell death
12553047_s5	These data demonstrate that GC inhibits the proliferation of Dunn OS cells via GR , for which one possible mechanism in vitro is induction of apoptosis .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
12554766_s0	Steroid hormone receptors , including estrogen receptor-alpha ( ERalpha ) , are ligand-activated transcription factors , and hormone binding leads to depletion of receptor levels via preteasome-mediated degradation .	
12554766_s1	NEDD8 ( neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated ) is an ubiquitin-like protein essential for protein processing and cell cycle progression .	
12554766_s2	We recently demonstrated that ubiquitin-activating enzyme ( Uba)3 , the catalytic subunit of the NEDD8-activating enzyme , inhibits ERalpha transcriptional activity .	
12554766_s3	Here we report that Uba3-mediated inhibition of ERalpha transactivation function is due to increased receptor protein turnover .	
12554766_s4	Coexpression of Uba3 with ERalpha increased receptor degradation by the 26S proteasome .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12554766_s5	Inhibition of NEDD8 activation and conjugation diminished polyubiquitination of ERalpha and blocked proteasome-mediated degradation of receptor protein .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12554766_s6	The antiestrogen ICI 182,780 is known to induce ER degradation .	
12554766_s7	In human MCF7 breast cancer cells modified to contain a disrupted NEDD8 pathway , ICI 182,780 degradation of ERalpha was impaired , and the antiestrogen was ineffective at inhibiting cell proliferation .	
12554766_s8	This study provides the first evidence linking nuclear receptor degradation with the NEDD8 pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome system , suggesting that the two pathways can act together to modulate ERalpha turnover and cellular responses to estrogens .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12554766_s9	Based on our observation that an intact NEDD8 pathway is essential for the antiproliferation activity of the ICI 182,780 in ERalpha positive breast cancer cells , we propose that disruptions in the NEDD8 pathway provide a mechanism by which breast cancer cells acquire antiestrogen resistance while retaining expression of ERalpha .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12556337_s0	PURPOSE The difference in radiosensitivity between two isogenic tumour cell lines was evaluated to determine whether factors such as sublethal and potentially damage repair , DNA double-strand break repair and fidelity of repair can be related to differences in radiosensitivity .	
12556337_s1	MATERIALS AND METHODS The cell lines used were the ovarian carcinoma A2780s and a radiation-resistant derivative A2780cp .	
12556337_s2	Radiation response was measured in terms of cell survival , recovery of sublethal ( SLD ) and potentially lethal damage ( PLD ) , induction of and recovery of DNA strand breaks , and fidelity of DNA repair using a cell-free plasmid assay .	
12556337_s3	RESULTS While A2780cp was more resistant to radiation than A2780s , it showed less ability for recovery of SLD and PLD .	
12556337_s4	DNA strand-break induction was the same for both cell lines , while only at very high doses did A2780cp show greater DNA strand-break recovery than A2780s .	genomic instability and mutation
12556337_s5	Fidelity of rejoining DNA was significantly higher in the A2780cp cell line .	
12556337_s6	CONCLUSION The difference in radiosensitivity between these two cell lines was not related to recovery of PLD or SLD or to the induction of DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
12556337_s7	It appears that fidelity of DNA rejoining , which was significantly higher in the resistant cell line , may be related to the difference in radiosensitivity .	
12561326_s0	We studied the effect of oxidative stress induced by hyperoxia , hydrogen peroxide , or menadione on mouse leukemia P388 cells at early ( 4 days ) and late ( 7 days ) stages of tumor growth .	
12561326_s1	Oxidative stress proved to inhibit cell division and to induce apoptosis .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
12561326_s2	Seven-day leukemia cells feature lower proliferative potential and higher sensitivity to oxidative stress and platidiam .	tumor promoting inflammation
12572356_s0	The effects of tea polyphenols and tea pigments on cell cycle of hepatic cancer cells were studied .	
12572356_s1	HepG2 cells were incubated with 50 and 100 mg/L tea polyphenols and tea pigments for 48 h respectively .	
12572356_s2	Flow cytometry , Western blot and RT-PCR analysis were used .	
12572356_s3	Flow cytometry analysis showed that tea polyphenols and tea pigments induced G1 arrest .	evading growth suppressors
12572356_s4	Western blot analysis showed tea polyphenols and tea pigments significantly inhibited the expression of cyclin D1 protein and induced higher expression of P21WAFI/CIPI protein .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12572356_s5	The result of RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that Cdk4 was significantly inhibited by tea polyphenols and tea pigments .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12572356_s6	It is concluded that the induction of cell cycle arrest may be an important mechanism of tea on cancer prevention .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12577104_s0	A clinicopathological study of 41 cases of pituitary apoplexy in a series of 324 surgically treated pituitary adenomas is presented .	
12577104_s1	In 23 patients , the predominant operative finding was hemorrhage with or without necrosis .	resisting cell death
12577104_s2	However , there were 15 ( 37.7% ) cases where pale , necrotic tissue with no evidence of hemorrhage was found at surgery .	
12577104_s3	Pale , necrotic material was particularly found when there was a long interval between the acute clinical event and surgery .	
12577104_s4	It is concluded that the pale , necrotic debris represents one stage in the resorption process of blood after hemorrhagic necrosis of pituitary adenomas .	
12577104_s5	This entity needs to be kept in mind especially since the material closely resemble the pultaceous material seen in craniopharyngiomas and epidermoid cysts .	
12588700_s0	Dietary antioxidants , such as the carotenoids , may protect DNA from oxidative damage .	
12588700_s1	This has been proposed to explain the epidemiological association between higher consumption of fruits and vegetables , which are rich in antioxidants , and lower incidence of cancer .	
12588700_s2	However , this remains to be demonstrated conclusively .	
12588700_s3	The effects of carotenoid supplementation on 1 ) baseline DNA damage , 2 ) susceptibility of cellular DNA to oxidative attack , and 3 ) DNA repair were measured in the human lymphocyte cell line Molt-17 .	
12588700_s4	Baseline DNA damage , susceptibility to oxidant attack ( 100 mumol/l H2O2 for 5 min at 4 degrees C ) , and disappearance of DNA single-strand breaks ( SSB ) after oxidative challenge were monitored by single-cell gel electrophoresis .	
12588700_s5	DNA repair patch synthesis activity in cell extracts was determined using assays that measure nucleotide incorporation during repair of oxidative lesions in template DNA .	
12588700_s6	Unlike single-cell gel electrophoresis , the parameters measured with these assays are not dependent on strand break religation .	
12588700_s7	There was no evidence that beta-carotene , lutein , or beta-cryptoxanthin supplementation protected cellular DNA from oxidation under basal conditions or after oxidative challenge .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
12588700_s8	However , only carotenoid-supplemented cells exhibited a significant decrease in numbers of SSB over a 2-h period after treatment with H2O2 .	genomic instability and mutation
12588700_s9	Carotenoid supplementation did not provoke any detectable change in repair patch synthesis activity .	genomic instability and mutation
12588700_s10	We conclude that supplementation with carotenoids at 8 mumol/l does not provide significant antioxidant protection for DNA in Molt-17 lymphocytes but may enhance recovery of cells from oxidative challenge , as measured by loss of SSB .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
12588700_s11	We argue that these data are most consistent with carotenoids acting to enhance DNA strand break repair .	genomic instability and mutation
12607599_s0	Angiogenesis is increased in hematologic malignancies , including non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) .	
12607599_s1	Elevated serum levels of two important angiogenic factors , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , are associated with a poor prognosis .	
12607599_s2	Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate 27 patients with NHL and bone marrow involvement ( 17 with low-grade B-cell NHL , including 7 with higher grade transformation ; 6 with intermediate-grade B-cell NHL ; and 4 with T-cell lymphoma ) .	
12607599_s3	Among the 17 patients with low-grade B-cell NHL , results for 7 were positive for VEGF stain ( 41.2% ) , and results were negative for all other stains for VEGF receptors , bFGF , and bFGF receptors .	inducing angiogenesis
12607599_s4	In the 10 patients with intermediate-grade B-cell NHL and T-cell lymphoma , all VEGF staining was positive ( 100% ) , but bFGF staining was only weakly positive in 2 .	inducing angiogenesis
12607599_s5	Staining results for seven patients who had low-grade B-cell NHL with higher grade transformation showed that VEGF staining was positive in large lymphoid cells of 5 patients and in small lymphoid cells of one patient .	inducing angiogenesis
12607599_s6	Staining for the receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was positive in large lymphoid cells in four and two cases , respectively .	inducing angiogenesis
12607599_s7	Staining for bFGF was positive in two cases of large lymphoid cells .	inducing angiogenesis
12607599_s8	We concluded that VEGF , but not bFGF , was associated with higher tumor grading of NHL and high-grade transformation of low-grade lymphoma .	inducing angiogenesis
12607798_s0	The role of T cells in eradicating leukemic cells has been well demonstrated for chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) .	
12607798_s1	Type 1 ( T1 ) T-cell cytokines play a major role in this antileukemic immune effect .	
12607798_s2	Studies in cancer patients have demonstrated a decreased T1 cytokine production , measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells .	
12607798_s3	This observation of malignancy-related suppressed T1 cytokines also occurs in untreated chronic-phase ( CP ) CML , raising the question of the influence of different CML treatment regimens on this immunosuppression .	
12607798_s4	Intracellular flow cytometry ( ICF ) has facilitated the evaluation of cytokines on a single-cell level .	
12607798_s5	This study analyzed T1 ( interferon-gamma ) cytokine production in purified peripheral blood T cells by ICF , comparing different therapy approaches for CML .	
12607798_s6	Twenty-one newly diagnosed CP CML patients were compared with 24 patients treated with interferon-alpha ( IFN-alpha ) and to 30 allogeneic bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) recipients ( BCR-ABL negative by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction , and free of , or having only limited graft-versus-host disease at the time of study ) .	
12607798_s7	Thirty-seven healthy controls were included .	
12607798_s8	Our results showed a significantly decreased T-cell IFN-gamma synthesis in CP CML patients in relation to healthy controls ( P = 0.0007 ) .	
12607798_s9	Treatment with IFN-alpha resulted in a shift from immunosuppression--documented for the group of untreated patients--to immunopotentiation , with an increase of T-cell IFN-gamma production ( P = 0.0266 ) .	avoiding immune destruction
12607798_s10	Notably , BMT enhanced IFN-gamma production of T cells to a level not only exceeding untreated patients ( P &lt ; 0.0001 ) but also healthy volunteers ( P &lt ; 0.0001 ) .	
12607798_s11	The observation of T1 cytokine up-regulation with IFN-alpha therapy indicates that enhanced T-cell function may be achievable in patients with CML , even in the absence of an allo-response .	
12611083_s0	Modulation of the balance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors holds great promise for the treatment of a broad spectrum of human disease ranging from ischemic heart disease to cancer .	
12611083_s1	This requires both the identification of angiogenic regulators and their efficient delivery to target organs .	
12611083_s2	Here , we demonstrate the use of a noncatalytic fragment of matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( termed PEX ) delivered by lentiviral vectors in different angiogenesis models .	inducing angiogenesis
12611083_s3	Transduction of human endothelial cells with PEX virus suppressed endothelial invasion and formation of capillary-like structures without affecting chemotaxis in vitro .	inducing angiogenesis
12611083_s4	Lentiviral delivery of PEX blocked basic fibroblast growth factor-induced matrix metalloproteinase 2 activation and angiogenesis on chicken chorioallantoic membranes .	inducing angiogenesis
12611083_s5	PEX expression also inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis and tumor growth in a nude mouse model .	inducing angiogenesis
12611083_s6	Thus , our study shows that lentiviral vectors can deliver sufficient quantities of antiangiogenic substances to achieve therapeutic effects in vivo .	
12632256_s0	The anti-breast cancer drug tamoxifen has recently been shown to cause an increase in intracellular free-Ca(2+) concentrations ( [ Ca(2+)](i) ) in renal tubular cells , breast cells and bladder cells .	
12632256_s1	Because tamoxifen is known to alter ovary function in human patients and in rats , the present study was aimed at exploring whether tamoxifen could alter Ca(2+) movement in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO-K1 ) cells .	
12632256_s2	Cytosolic free-Ca(2+) levels in populations of cells have been explored by using fura-2 as a fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator .	
12632256_s3	Tamoxifen at concentrations above 1 micro M increased [ Ca(2+)](i) in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 8 micro M. The Ca(2+) signal was reduced by removing extracellular Ca(2+) , but was not affected by nifedipine , verapamil , diltiazem or ICI 182,780 ( an estrogen receptor antagonist ) .	
12632256_s4	Pretreatment with 1 micro M thapsigargin ( an endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor ) to deplete the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) abolished 10 micro M tamoxifen-induced Ca(2+) release .	
12632256_s5	Neither inhibition of phospholipase C with 2 micro M U73122 nor depletion of ryanodine-sensitive Ca(2+) stores with 50 micro M ryanodine affected tamoxifen-induced Ca(2+) release .	
12632256_s6	Cell proliferation assays using ELISA revealed that overnight incubation with 5-10 micro M tamoxifen inhibited cell proliferation by 20% , and 20 micro M tamoxifen killed all cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12632256_s7	Together , the results suggest that , in CHO-K1 cells , tamoxifen induced a [ Ca(2+)](i) increase by causing store-Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum in an phospholipase C-independent manner , and by inducing Ca(2+) influx .	
12632256_s8	The action of tamoxifen appears to be dissociated from estrogen receptor activation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12632256_s9	Longer incubation with tamoxifen ( &gt;5 micro M ) was cytotoxic .	
12634122_s0	The identification of molecular markers related to critical biological processes during carcinogenesis may aid in the evaluation of carcinogenic potentials of chemicals and chemical mixtures .	
12634122_s1	Work from our laboratory demonstrated that a single treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine ( MNNG ) enhanced spontaneous malignant transformation of the human keratinocyte cell line RHEK-1 .	
12634122_s2	In contrast , chronic low-level exposure of cells to arsenic alone or in a mixture containing arsenic , cadmium , chromium , and lead inhibited malignant conversion .	
12634122_s3	To identify changes in gene expression that influence these different outcomes , cDNA microarray technology was used .	
12634122_s4	Analysis of multiple human arrays in MNNG-transformed RHEK-1 cells , designated OM3 , and those treated with arsenic or the arsenic-containing metal mixture showed unique patterns of gene expression .	
12634122_s5	Genes that were overexpressed in OM3 included oncogenes , cell cycle regulators , and those involved in signal transduction , whereas genes for DNA repair enzymes and inhibitors of transformation and metastasis were suppressed .	activating invasion and metastasis,evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
12634122_s6	In arsenic-treated cells , multiple DNA repair proteins were overexpressed .	genomic instability and mutation
12634122_s7	Mixture-treated cells showed increased expression of a variety of genes including metallothioneins and integrin 4 .	
12634122_s8	These cells showed decreased expression of oncogenes , DNA repair proteins , and genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway .	
12634122_s9	For comparison we are currently analyzing gene expression changes in RHEK-1 cells transformed by other means .	
12634122_s10	The goal of these studies is to identify common batteries of genes affected by chemical modulators of the carcinogenic process .	
12634122_s11	Mechanistic studies may allow us to correlate alterations in their expression with sequential stages in the carcinogenic process and may aid in the risk assessment of other xenobiotics .	
12636098_s0	Purpose of this work was to synthesize several cis-/trans- isomer pairs of the platinum(II) complexes , and study the extent and the mode of their antiproliferative activity on HeLa cells .	
12636098_s1	Six platinum(II) isomer pairs have a general formula cis-/trans-[PtA2X2] , where A is ligand : ammonia ( NH3 ) , pyridine ( Py ) ; and X is ligand : chloride ion ( Cl- ) , bromide ion ( Br- ) , iodide ion ( I- ) , thiocyanato ion ( SCN- ) ; four compounds have different structural formulas , and these are cis-/trans-[Pt(NH2OH)2(NH3)2]Cl2 , and cis-/trans-Pt(Gly)2 , where Gly is bidentate glycinato ligand .	
12636098_s2	Results of the MTT assay , showed that six cis- and one trans-platinum(II) complexes exhibited cytotoxicity ( IC50 ) ranging between 5 and 33 microM .	
12636098_s3	Most of the cis-platinum(II) isomers caused significant alteration of cell cycle phases progression , and induced apoptosis in degree that varied among different compounds , as evaluated using flowcytometry and morphological study .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
12636098_s4	Spectrophotometric analysis ( AAS ) indicated that there is no correlation between intracellular platinum(II) accumulation and cytotoxicity of tested complexes .	
12636105_s0	The effects of deoxycholic acid ( DCA ) and ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) on 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ( PhIP)-induced aberrant crypt foci ( ACF ) in the rat colon were examined .	
12636105_s1	The effect of these bile acids on DNA adduct formation by PhIP in the colon was then analyzed , since the main action of PhIP is the formation of DNA adducts and subsequent gene mutations .	
12636105_s2	For the ACF study , male F344 rats were administered PhIP-HCl ( 75 mg/kg , 10 doses ) by gavage , and a diet containing bile acid ( 0.4% DCA or UDCA ) was provided from 3 days before the first dose of PhIP for 8 weeks .	
12636105_s3	The mean number of ACF per colon of DCA , UDCA and controls were 9.9 , 2.4 and 5.5 , respectively .	
12636105_s4	The ACF number was significantly increased by DCA and decreased by UDCA ( P&lt;0.001 ) .	
12636105_s5	To examine the effect of bile acids on DNA adduct formation , male F344 rats were fed a diet supplemented with bile acids ( 0.1 or 0.4% of DCA and UDCA ) 7 days prior to the PhIP administration .	
12636105_s6	All rats were administered a single dose of PhIP-HCl ( 50 mg/kg ) by gavage and sacrificed 48 hours later .	
12636105_s7	DNA adduct levels of the 0.1% UDCA , 0.1% DCA and controls were 2.93 ( adducts/10(7) nucleotides ) , 2.65 and 1.10 , respectively .	genomic instability and mutation
12636105_s8	Those of 0.4% UDCA , 0.4% DCA and controls were 1.64 , 1.30 and 1.00 , respectively .	
12636105_s9	The PhIP-DNA adduct level was significantly increased by administration of 0.1% UDCA , 0.1% DCA ( P&lt;0.05 ) and 0.4% UDCA ( P&lt;0.01 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
12636105_s10	The increasing effect of both DCA and UDCA on PhIP-induced DNA adduct formation was unexpected , and was not directly associated with ACF formation .	genomic instability and mutation
12641820_s0	Previously we have found deregulation of collagen metabolism in human pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer tissues .	
12641820_s1	Insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) is known to stimulate collagen biosynthesis through interaction with IGF-I receptor .	
12641820_s2	IGF-I binding proteins ( BPs ) regulate the activity of IGF-I .	
12641820_s3	We investigated whether serum and tissue IGF-I and IGF-BPs as well as tissue IGF-I receptor expression may reflect disturbances of collagen metabolism in patients with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer .	
12641820_s4	In pancreatitis tissue , a significant increase in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 content was accompanied by a distinct increase in IGF-I receptor expression , compared to control pancreas tissue .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12641820_s5	In contrast , serum from patients with pancreatitis did not show significant increases in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels , however , significant increases in IGFBP-1 level ( 2.5 fold ) .	
12641820_s6	Moreover , a distinct decrease in radioactive IGF-binding to the BPs , compared to control serum , was found .	
12641820_s7	Pancreatic cancer tissue and serum of patients with pancreatic cancer showed significant increases in IGF-I , IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-1 content , accompanied by dramatic increases in IGF-I tissue receptor expression , compared to controls .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12641820_s8	In serum of patients with pancreatic cancer distinct increases in radioactive IGF-binding to 46 kDa BP , compared to control serum , were observed .	
12641820_s9	The data suggest that disturbances in tissue collagen metabolism during pancreatic diseases may result from deregulation of IGF-I homeostasis and that elevated serum levels of IGF-I , IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-1 may serve as markers of pancreatic cancer .	
12643444_s0	The epidemiologic association between asbestos exposure and human malignant mesothelioma is well established .	
12643444_s1	However , the molecular mechanisms linking asbestos exposure of humans and the subsequent mesothelioma formation is not well understood .	
12643444_s2	The most frequent genetic changes found so far in human malignant mesothelioma ( HMM ) are deletions and point mutations in the tumor suppressor genes p16INK4a and NF2 .	
12643444_s3	Whereas homozygous deletions appear to be the predominant mechanism leading to p16/CDKN2A inactivation , inactivating point mutations coupled with allelic loss mainly occur at the NF2 locus .	
12643444_s4	In the present study , asbestos-treated human mesothelial cells ( HMC ) , SV40-transformed human mesothelial cells ( MeT-5A ) and a human mesothelioma cell line ( COLO ) were investigated for genetic changes of cell cycle genes ( cyclin D1 , p16INK4a , RB1 , CDK2 ) using multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization ( mFISH ) in interphase cells .	
12643444_s5	The results show that cyclin D1 is unaffected in all investigated cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12643444_s6	The p16INK4a gene locus was shown to be mutated in COLO cells but not in HMC .	
12643444_s7	After labeling of CDK2 and RB1 , hemizygous loss of one allele of each gene was observed in asbestos-treated HMC whereas gene amplification of these genes was detectable in MeT-5A and COLO cells .	
12643444_s8	Our data indicate that disarrangement of the RB1 dependent pathway seems to be involved in mesothelioma formation .	
12650706_s0	The cellular mechanisms of anti-androgen-induced tumor regression have not been investigated in great detail .	
12650706_s1	We have compared the induction of cell death in the androgen-dependent , non-invasive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line by Casodex and TNF-alpha .	
12650706_s2	Both agents induce a dose and time-dependent decrease in cell viability in vitro .	
12650706_s3	However , Casodex does not induce classical DNA fragmentation to oligonucleosomes typically induced by TNF-alpha , but rather induces cleavage to form intermediate 60 kb DNA fragments .	resisting cell death
12650706_s4	RT-PCR based analysis demonstrates that in LNCaP cells Casodex coordinately alters the expression of steady-state level of mRNAs of several matrix metalloproteases and their cognate inhibitors ( most notably MMP2 and TIMP1 ) .	
12650706_s5	Zymography and reverse zymography confirm that the ratio of metalloprotease(s) to inhibitor(s) is altered in favor of activation of the proteases .	
12650706_s6	In a small percentage of the treated LNCaP cells , the activation of the extracellular matrix ( ECM)-proteases by Casodex also induces an invasive phenotype .	activating invasion and metastasis
12650706_s7	The acquisition of an invasive phenotype is not seen when LNCaP cells are treated with TNF-alpha , and is not seen when the LNCaP cells are treated with both compounds simultaneously , suggesting that the phenomenon may be specific to particular classes of compounds .	activating invasion and metastasis
12650706_s8	These observations have significant implications in the treatment of prostate cancer , since the appearance of a more aggressive phenotype following treatment is clearly undesirable .	
12658805_s0	To elucidate role of the three enzymes in hepatocarcinogenesis , hMTH1 , hOGG1 and hMYH , mRNA expression were examined by using RT/semi-quantitative real-time PCR and 8-O-HdG levels was studied by HPLC/ECD in HCC and non-tumorous liver tissue of 21 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) .	
12658805_s1	It was found that the 8-OHdG level in non-tumourous liver tissue was significantly higher than in HCC tissue ( P = 0.006 ) , and this was correlated with the degree of inflammation .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
12658805_s2	The hMTH1 expression in HCC tissue was significantly higher than in non-tumorous liver tissue ( P = 0.014 ) .	
12658805_s3	Inversely , The hMYH alpha expression was significantly increased ( P = 0.039 ) in non-tumorous liver tissue .	
12658805_s4	No difference was seen in hOGG1 expression in non-tumorous liver and HCC tissue .	
12658805_s5	A significant linear correlation between hMTH1 and hOGG1 expression was found both in HCC tissue ( r = 0.809 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) and in non-tumorous liver tissue ( r = 0.883 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
12658805_s6	Our findings suggested a reactive rather than pathogenic role of the DNA repair enzymes in the hepatocarcinogenesis .	genomic instability and mutation
12658828_s0	OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were to analyse the results and long term outcome in a prospective non randomised trial of 74 patients treated by laparoscopic colo-rectal resection for cancer , and to determine wether survival and recurrence are or are not compromised by an initial laparoscopic approach .	
12658828_s1	PATIENTS AND METHODS Seventy-four patients with colo-rectal carcinoma were included in a prospective trial and treated by laparoscopic resection .	
12658828_s2	All patients were reviewed at 1 , 3 , and 6 months interval .	
12658828_s3	A median of 5 years follow up was available .	
12658828_s4	Forty-eight patients ( 65% ) had more than 3 years of follow up .	
12658828_s5	RESULTS Six conversions ( 8.1% ) were necessary : 2 for tumor invasion of adjacent organs , 2 for limited margin resection in lower rectal tumors , 1 for small bowel injury and 1 for obesity .	activating invasion and metastasis
12658828_s6	After surgery , passing flatus occurred at 34.3 +/- 16.7 h and oral intake could be reinstaured at 42.6 +/- 22 h .	
12658828_s7	Mean postoperative stay was 8.2 +/- 3.4 days .	
12658828_s8	No death occurred .	
12658828_s9	The overall morbidity was about 13.5% .	
12658828_s10	The rate of late complications was 5.4% .	
12658828_s11	Two port site metastasis ( 2.6% ) were seen in locally advanced carcinoma .	activating invasion and metastasis
12658828_s12	Recurrence rate at 5 years was 0% for Dukes A , 20% for Dukes B , 39.2% for Dukes C. Survival rate at 5 years was 100% for Dukes A , 80% for Dukes B , and 60.7% for Dukes C. These results are similar to those of conventional open surgery .	
12658828_s13	CONCLUSION Laparoscopic colorectal resection for cancer can be performed safely , with a low morbidity and rare late complications .	
12658828_s14	Long term follow up ( 5 years ) assessment shows similar outcome compared with conventional surgery .	
12659514_s0	Solar ultraviolet radiation is considered to be injurious rather than necessary for most organisms living on the earth .	
12659514_s1	It is reported that the risk of skin cancer in humans increases by the depletion of the ozone layer .	
12659514_s2	We have examined the genotoxicity of solar ultraviolet , especially the longer wavelength light , using Drosophila .	
12659514_s3	Recently , we have demonstrated that light of wavelength up to 340 nm is mutagenic on Drosophila larvae .	
12659514_s4	Using an excision repair-deficient Drosophila strain ( mus201 ) , we have obtained results suggesting that the lesion caused in larvae by the 320 nm-light irradiation may be similar to the damage induced by irradiation at 310 nm , and that light of 330 and 340 nm may induce damage different from that induced by 310 and 320 nm-light .	
12659514_s5	To examine the difference in DNA damage induced by light of a particular wavelength , we performed monochromatic irradiation on larvae of two Drosophila strains ; one excision repair-deficient ( mei-9 ) and another postreplication repair-deficient ( mei-41). 310 and 320 nm-light was more mutagenic in the mei-9 strain than in mei-41 , whereas 330 and 340 nm-light was more mutagenic in mei-41 than in mei-9 .	
12659514_s6	It is demonstrated that the mei-41 gene is a homologue of the human atm gene which is responsible for a cell cycle checkpoint .	evading growth suppressors
12659514_s7	This result suggests that 310-320 nm-light induces DNA damage that is subject to nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) and that 330-360 nm-light causes damage to be recognized by the cell cycle checkpoint but it is not repairable by NER .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
12660017_s0	In the course of a medicinal chemistry program aimed at discovering novel tumour-active rebeccamycin derivatives targeting DNA and/or topoisomerase I , a series of analogues with the sugar residue linked to the two indole nitrogens was recently developed .	
12660017_s1	Two promising drug candidates in this staurosporine-rebeccamycin hybrid series were selected for a DNA-binding study reported here .	
12660017_s2	The DNA interaction of the cationic indolocarbazole glycosides MP059 bearing a N,N-diethylaminoethyl side chain and MP072 containing a sugar bearing an amino group was compared with that of the uncharged analogue MP024 .	
12660017_s3	The results show that the addition of a cationic substituent , either directly on the indolocarbazole chromophore or on the carbohydrate residue , significantly reinforces the interaction of the drugs with nucleic acids .	
12660017_s4	The two cationic molecules MP059 and MP072 recognise preferentially sequences containing GpT.ApC and TpG.CpA steps but they do not inhibit topoisomerase I , in contrast to the parent uncharged derivative MP024 which stimulates DNA single strand breaks by topoisomerase I. The cytotoxic activity of the indolocarbazole derivatives bearing positively charged groups is one order of magnitude higher than that of the neutral compound MP024 .	genomic instability and mutation
12660017_s5	The high cytotoxic potential can be attributed to the enhanced DNA binding and sequence recognition capacity of the cationic compounds .	
12660017_s6	The study provides useful information for further structure-activity relationship studies in the indolocarbazole series .	
12664615_s0	Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid ( AKBA ) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene isolated from the gum resin exudate from the stem of the tree Boswellia serrata ( frankincense ) .	
12664615_s1	AKBA has been recently identified as a novel , orally active , non-redox and non-competitive 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor that also inhibits topisomerase I and II in vitro .	
12664615_s2	Because natural pentacyclic triterpenes have an antiproliferative effect against different tumor types , we investigated the effects of AKBA on the proliferation of 11 primary cell cultures established from human surgical specimens of meningiomas , common central nervous system tumors .	
12664615_s3	Treatment of meningioma cells by AKBA revealed a potent cytotoxic activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations in the range of 2-8 microM .	
12664615_s4	At similar , physiologically achievable concentrations , AKBA rapidly ( within minutes ) and potently inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 ( Erk-1 and Erk-2 ) in meningioma cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor BB .	
12664615_s5	High expression level of 5-LO was detected in primary meningioma cells and surgical specimens by immunoblotting analysis , suggesting the possible role of 5-LO in meningioma tumorigenesis .	
12664615_s6	Considering the critical importance of the Erk-1/2 signal transduction pathway not only in meningiomas but in other human neoplasms , the interruption of signaling through this evolutionarily conserved pathway might be one of the mechanisms by which AKBA induces suppression of proliferation and apoptosis of different tumor types .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12674376_s0	Common use of antimutagens and anticarcinogens in everyday life is an effective measure for preventing human cancer and genetic diseases .	
12674376_s1	Antioxidant properties of tea have vast potential as protective agents against diverse toxic effects .	
12674376_s2	The present study was aimed to evaluate the role of aqueous clonal tea extracts ( green tea , oolong tea and black tea ) in modulating the genotoxic damage induced by cyclophosphamide ( CP ) , a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug and a well-known mutagen and clastogen .	
12674376_s3	All the three tea extracts at 1 and 2% concentration did not increase the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes ( MPE ) in bone marrow cells of mice when administered individually .	genomic instability and mutation
12674376_s4	The tea extracts decreased the micronuclei ( MN ) induced by CP .	genomic instability and mutation
12674376_s5	Therefore , regular intake of tea may improve the antioxidant status in in vivo and thereby reduce the risk of cancer and coronary heart disease .	
12674762_s0	To investigate whether the Bcl-2 gene family is involved in modulating mechanism of apoptosis and change of cell cycle protein induced by curcumin in acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell line and primary acute myelogenous leukemic cells , the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 , Bax and Bak and cell cycle proteins including P27kipl , P21wafl , cyclin D3 and pRbp- were selected and their expression detected by SABC immuno-histochemical stain method .	
12674762_s1	The attitude of sub-G1 peak in DNA histogram was determined by FCM .	
12674762_s2	The TUNEL positive cell percentage was identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT)-mediated Biotin dUNP end labeling technique .	
12674762_s3	It was found that when HL-60 cells were treated with 25 mumol/L curcumin for 24 h , the expression level of Mcl-1 was down-regulated , but that of Bax and Bak up-regulated time-dependently .	
12674762_s4	There was significant difference in the expression level of Mcl-1 , Bax and Bak between the curcumin-treated groups and control group ( P &lt ; 0.05-0.01 ) .	
12674762_s5	At the same time , curcumin had no effect on progress of cell cycle in primaty acute myelogenous leukemia at newly diagnosis , but could increase the peak of Sub-G1 ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) , and down-regulate the expression of Mcl-1 and up-regulate the expression of Bax and Bak with the difference being statistically significant .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12674762_s6	The expression of P27kipl , P21wafl and pRbp- were elevated and that of cyclin D3 decreased in the presence of curcumin .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12674762_s7	These findings suggested that the Bcl-2 gene family indeed participated in the regulatory process of apoptosis induced by curcumin in HL-60 cells and AML cells .	resisting cell death
12674762_s8	Curcumin can induce apoptosis of primary acute myelogenous leukemic cells and disturb cell cycle progression of HL-60 cells .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
12674762_s9	The mechanism appeared to be mediated by perturbing G0/G1 phases checkpoints which associated with up-regulation of P27kipl , P21wafl and pRbp- expression , and down-regulation of cyclin D3 .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
12674770_s0	To evaluate the effects of adenovirus ( Ad)-mediated transfer of p53 and p16 on human bladder cancer cells EJ , EJ were transfected with Ad-p53 and Ad-p16 .	
12674770_s1	Cell growth , morphological change , cell cycle , apoptosis were measured using MTT assay , flow cytometry , cloning formation , immunocytochemical assays .	
12674770_s2	Ad-p16 or Ad-p53 alone could inhibit the proliferating activity of EJ cells in vitro .	
12674770_s3	Ad-p53 could induce apoptosis of partial EJ cells .	resisting cell death
12674770_s4	G1 arrest was observed 72 h after infection with Ad-p16 , but apoptosis was not obvious .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
12674770_s5	The transfer of Ad-p16 and Ad-p53 could significantly inhibit the growth of EJ cells , decrease the cloning formation rate and induce apoptosis of large number of EJ cells .	resisting cell death
12674770_s6	The occurrence time of subcutaneous tumor was delayed and the tumor volume in 4 weeks was diminished by using Ad-p53 combined with Ad-p16 and the difference was significant compared with using Ad-p53 or Ad-p16 alone .	
12674770_s7	It was suggested that the transfer of wild-type p53 and p16 could significantly inhibit the growth of human bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo .	
12683217_s0	A comparative study was undertaken between cancer of the uterine cervix ( n = 50 ) and female breast cancer ( n = 50 ) with reference to the expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein ( HER-2/neu ) and that of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGF-R ) , both being highly homologous structurally .	
12683217_s1	Expressions of EGF-R and c-erbB-2 oncoprotein were viewed in breast and cervical cancer tissues by immunochemical staining .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12683217_s2	Cervical cancer cases showed much higher expression of EGF-R which also revealed significant association with the expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein and tumour grading .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12683217_s3	Among breast cancer cases , over-expression of EGF-R correlated significantly with metastasis of lymph node ; and expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein showed a significant relationship with histological grading of the tumour .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
12683217_s4	Moreover , an association was noticed between the tumour grade and the concomitant immuno positive expression of EGF-R and c-erbB-2 .	
12683217_s5	Our study revealed an existence of a conflicting pattern in the expression of EGF-R and c-erbB-2 oncoprotein between carcinomas of the breast and uterine cervix .	
12685860_s0	Transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) exerts potent immunosuppressive effects .	
12685860_s1	In this study , we investigated the potential role of TGF-beta1 produced by hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cell lines in immunosuppression mechanisms .	
12685860_s2	Using the Mv1Lu cell-growth inhibition assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , we detected optimal levels of TGF-beta1 in the culture supernatants conditioned by the HCC cell lines PLC/PRF/5 , Hep3B , and HepG2 .	
12685860_s3	To determine the biological activity of TGF-beta1 in the supernatants , we examined the effects of the culture supernatants on the production of interferon ( IFN)-gamma induced during the culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) stimulated with interleukin ( IL)-12 .	
12685860_s4	IFN-gamma production of IL-12-stimulated PBMCs in the 1:1 dilution of the acid-activated conditioned medium of PLC/PRF/5 , Hep3B , and HepG2 reduced to 14.7 +/- 0.8 , 17.3 +/- 9.0 , and 35.9 +/- 14.6% , respectively , compared with the value in the culture with control medium ( complete culture medium ) .	
12685860_s5	These results suggest that HCC cells producing TGF-beta1 may reduce the generation or activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) and natural killer ( NK ) cells , and thus could enhance their ability to escape immune-mediated surveillance .	avoiding immune destruction
12699839_s0	INTRODUCTION Cell-cell interaction is an essential component of atherosclerotic plaque development .	
12699839_s1	Activated monocytes appear to play a central role in the development of atherosclerosis , not only through foam cell formation but also via the production of various growth factors that induce proliferation of different cell types that are involved in the plaque development .	
12699839_s2	Using serum free co-culture method , we determined the effect of monocytes on endothelial cell proliferation .	
12699839_s3	METHODS Endothelial cell proliferation is determined by the amount of [ 3H]thymidine incorporated in to the DNA .	
12699839_s4	Basic fibroblast growth factor ( b-FGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) levels in the conditioned medium were determined by ELISA .	
12699839_s5	RESULTS Conditioned medium from unactivated monocytes partially inhibited endothelial cell proliferation , whereas conditioned medium from activated monocytes promoted endothelial cell proliferation .	
12699839_s6	The mitogenic effect of conditioned medium derived from activated monocytes is due to the presence of b-FGF , VEGF and IL-8 .	inducing angiogenesis
12699839_s7	Neutralizing antibodies against b-FGF , VEGF and IL-8 partially reversed the mitogenic effect of conditioned medium derived from activated monocytes .	inducing angiogenesis
12699839_s8	When b-FGF , VEGF and IL-8 were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium derived from activated monocytes , it is less mitogenic to endothelial cells .	inducing angiogenesis
12699839_s9	CONCLUSION Activated monocytes may play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic plaque by producing endothelial cell growth factors .	
12716464_s0	Previous experiments have shown that emodin is highly active in suppressing the proliferation of several tumor cell lines .	
12716464_s1	However , it is not clear that emodin can induce growth inhibition of hepatoma cells .	
12716464_s2	We have found that emodin induces apoptotic responses in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines ( HCC ) Mahlavu , PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 .	resisting cell death
12716464_s3	The addition of emodin to these three cell lines led to inhibition of growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner .	
12716464_s4	Emodin generated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in these cells which brought about a reduction of the intracellular mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( DeltaPsim ) , followed by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 , leading to DNA fragmentation and apoptosis .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
12716464_s5	Our findings demonstrate that ROS and the resulting oxidative stress play a pivotal role in apoptosis .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
12716464_s6	Preincubation of hepatoma cell lines with the hydrogen peroxide-scavenging enzyme , catalase ( CAT ) and cyclosporin A ( CsA ) , partially inhibited apoptosis .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
12716464_s7	These results demonstrate that enhancement of generation of ROS , DeltaPsim disruption and caspase activation may be involved in the apoptotic pathway induced by emodin .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
12718607_s0	Tea ( Camellia sinensis ) is one of the most popular beverages , consumed worldwide .	
12718607_s1	The health promoting properties of tea have been attributed to its antioxidative polyphenolic constituents and their oxidative products .	
12718607_s2	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of a black tea infusion on azoxymethane induced colonic preneoplastic lesions , the aberrant crypt foci in Sprague-Dawley rats .	
12718607_s3	Rats were injected with azoxymethane ( 15mg/kg.b.w. ) and received oral administration of 1% and 2% ( w/v ) tea infusions from the 1(st)day of carcinogen application .	
12718607_s4	The treatment was continued for 12 weeks .	
12718607_s5	The colons were then assessed for aberrant crypt foci and compared with the untreated carcinogen control group .	
12718607_s6	In situ cell proliferation and in situ apoptosis were also estimated using Brdu incorporation and the TUNEL method , respectively .	resisting cell death
12718607_s7	Aberrant crypt foci were reduced significantly ( by 44% in the 1% tea-treated and by about 40% in 2% tea-treated group ) .	
12718607_s8	Significant decrease in proliferation and increase in apoptosis suggest a possible interplay between the two processes resulting in inhibition of colon carcinogenesis by black tea .	resisting cell death
12725487_s0	In the present study we examined the effects of menadione , a redox cycling agent , on structural changes of human osteosarcoma line 143B cells .	
12725487_s1	It has been previously reported that menadione can cause necrotic or apoptotic cell death in a concentration- depending manner .	
12725487_s2	In our experimental model , cells were treated with 100 microM menadione for 24 hours .	
12725487_s3	Using electron microscopy technique cells carrying three kinds of morphological changes were detected : necrotic cells , apoptotic cells and those demonstrating a co-existence of apoptotic and necrotic features in one single cell .	resisting cell death
12734068_s0	Resveratrol , a phytoalexin found in grapes and wine , has been shown to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological properties and is believed to play a role in the chemoprevention of human cancer .	
12734068_s1	Resveratrol has also been shown to induce antiproliferation and apoptosis of several leukemia cell lines .	
12734068_s2	In the present study , we investigated the effect of resveratrol in adult T cell leukemia .	
12734068_s3	Our present observations showed that resveratrol induced growth inhibition in all five human T cell lymphotrophic virus-1-infected cell lines examined , with 50% effective dose of 10.4-85.6 mM .	
12734068_s4	In the resveratrol-treated cells , induction of apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V-based analyses and morphological changes .	resisting cell death
12734068_s5	The most surprising observation was that resveratrol treatment resulted in a gradual decrease in the expression of survivin , an antiapoptotic protein , during cell apoptosis .	resisting cell death
12734068_s6	These findings indicate that resveratrol inhibits the growth of human T cell lymphotrophic virus-1-infected cell lines , at least in part , by inducing apoptosis mediated by downregulation in survivin expression .	resisting cell death
12734068_s7	In view of the accumulating evidence that survivin may be an important determinant of a clinical response in adult T cell leukemia , our present findings have led to the suggestion that resveratrol , a common constituent of the human diet , merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for this incurable disease .	
1280402_s0	Intra-arterial infusion with cisplatin ( CDDP ) and bleomycin ( BLM ) was carried out in 21 patients with locally recurrent uterine cervical cancer who were previously treated with irradiation alone .	
1280402_s1	Patients were treated with a bolus infusion into both internal iliac arteries of 50 mg/m2 of CDDP and 30 mg/m2 of BLM .	
1280402_s2	Two to four courses of the infusion therapy were given to each patient , and the response rate , the tumor and serum drug concentrations , and the cell kinetics in tumor tissue were evaluated .	
1280402_s3	The response rate ( CR+PR ) was 71.4% according to the WHO criteria .	
1280402_s4	There was no difference , in the tumor tissue concentrations of CDDP and BLM between responders and nonresponders .	
1280402_s5	Although the DNA ploidy of tumor cells was not significantly different between the two groups before treatment , both the labeling index with BrdU and the proliferation index with flow cytometry significantly increased 24 hours after treatment in responding tumors but not in nonresponding tumors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1280402_s6	These results show that intra-arterial infusion with CDDP and BLM improves the prognosis of recurrent cervical cancer and that labeling and proliferation indices may be useful for determining the response of cervical cancer to intra-arterial chemotherapy .	
1280703_s0	We have isolated rabbit kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell lines .	
1280703_s1	The selection was based on their ability to form confluent monolayers on porous supports and to maintain receptor-mediated signal transduction and ion transport , characteristic of the proximal tubule .	
1280703_s2	The isolation method consisted of several steps : ( 1 ) superficial cortical proximal tubule segments were microdissected and cultured on a matrix-coated porous support until cells formed a confluent monolayer ; ( 2 ) primary cultures showing hormone-regulated ion transport typical for the proximal tubule were selected and co-cultured with irradiated fibroblasts ; and ( 3 ) the epithelial cells surviving after several passages were expanded and passaged on porous substrates .	
1280703_s3	Most of the cell lines developed in this manner were obtained by co-culture with irradiated fibroblasts producing a recombinant retrovirus encoding SV40 large T antigen and G418 resistance .	
1280703_s4	However , SV40 T antigen expression was not essential for immortalization , since neither T antigen nor G418 resistance was detected in the isolated cell lines and co-culture with non-producing 3T3 cells gave similar results .	enabling replicative immortality
1280703_s5	One cell line ( vEPT ) has been characterized in some detail with respect to morphological , biochemical , and ion transport properties .	
1280703_s6	This line forms confluent monolayers with apical microvilli , tight junctions , and convolutions of the basolateral plasma membrane .	
1280703_s7	Once confluent , monolayers maintain conductances of 25 to 32 mS/cm2 for several weeks in culture and possess phlorizin-sensitive short-circuit current ( Isc ) in glucose containing media , indicative of apical Na(+)-glucose co-transport. vEPT cells also retain receptor and signaling mechanisms for angiotensin II ( Ang II ) .	
1280703_s8	Apical and basal Ang II and 5,6-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid ( 5,6-EET ) modulate the Isc in a manner similar to primary cultures .	
1280703_s9	The cell lines share with primary cultures expression of the cytokeratins K8 , K10/K11 , and K19 ( "nomenclature " [ 21] ) .	
1280703_s10	They also retain several receptor and signal transduction mechanisms .	
1280703_s11	For example , Ang II , arachidonate , bradykinin , 5,6-EET , parathyroid hormone ( residues 1 through 34 ) , and purine nucleotides increase cytosolic Ca2+ , PTH elevates cAMP levels , and Ang II enhances proximal tubule-specific arachidonic acid metabolism .	
1281278_s0	In human fibroblasts , the expression of SV40 large T antigen is known to cause a variety of chromosomal aberrations and especially dicentric chromosomes .	
1281278_s1	In some cases , the later aberrations have been reported to be reversible telomeric associations .	
1281278_s2	We report here aberration and chromosome number studies of twenty-nine T antigen positive lineages , studied from their initiation by transfection of T antigen sequences into human diploid fibroblasts , until crisis or immortalization occurred or , in some cases until the lines became tumorigenic in nude mice .	enabling replicative immortality
1281278_s3	The data show that T antigen consistently produced chromosomal instability of both number and structure by an active process that began before transformation indicators were positive and continued throughout neoplastic progression .	genomic instability and mutation
1281278_s4	The most frequently observed aberrations were dicentric chromosomes , which were shown to be true dicentrics by examination by in situ hybridization with telomeric sequences .	
1281278_s5	These data are consistent with the hypothesis that T antigen causes human fibroblasts to become neoplastically transformed by successive rounds of chromosomal mutation and lineage evolution .	genomic instability and mutation
1281386_s0	Basal cell hyperplasia classically has been described as having bland cytologic features .	
1281386_s1	During the past 2 years , we have seen 12 cases ( 11 in consultation ) with atypical features that were confused with adenocarcinoma of the prostate .	
1281386_s2	Eleven of these 12 cases contained prominent nucleoli mimicking carcinoma ; in the 12th case , nuclei were enlarged , hyperchromatic , and moderately pleomorphic .	
1281386_s3	Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against high-molecular-weight cytokeratin ( 34 beta E12 ) was performed in nine of the cases , verifying their basal cell nature .	
1281386_s4	Additional findings in these cases were necrotic intraluminal secretions ( two cases ) , immature squamous metaplasia ( two cases ) , peculiar hyaline cytoplasmic globules ( two cases ) , adenosis ( one case ) , markedly atypical nuclei of uncertain nature occurring elsewhere in the specimen ( one case ) , and intraluminal blue mucin ( two cases ) .	
1281386_s5	We analyzed nine cases of typical basal cell hyperplasia , all of which showed classic features of basal cell hyperplasia with benign cytology .	
1281386_s6	Both atypical and classical basal cell hyperplasia were frequently infiltrated by lymphocytes such that the cytologic changes could not be attributable to inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
1281386_s7	Atypical basal cell hyperplasia must be differentiated from ordinary adenocarcinoma of the prostate , prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia , and basaloid carcinoma ( adenoid cystic carcinoma ) of the prostate .	
12814188_s0	The telomerase activity and the senescence profile of cultured breast fibroblasts from normal human interstitial and malignant stromal tissue were studied in comparison with their proliferation and differentiation pattern .	
12814188_s1	Fibroblasts were grown either in the presence or absence of a conditioned medium ( CM ) obtained from cultures of the oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cell line .	
12814188_s2	At different passages ( from the 2nd up to the 48th ) , fibroblasts were examined for the telomerase activity by the Telomerase Repeats Amplification Protocol ( TRAP ) assay , for proliferation profile by Ki-67 antigen expression , and the myofibroblast or smooth muscle cell-like differentiation pattern by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies specific for smooth muscle markers .	
12814188_s3	Serial passages of fibroblasts from normal or tumour breast reveal that the relationship between the levels of telomerase activity and phenotypic/proliferation profile changes with cell subcultivation in a different manner in the two cell populations .	
12814188_s4	The fibroblasts from normal tissue completed 12 passages in a CM-independent way prior to senescence whereas fibroblasts from tumour stroma senescence were attained after 48 passages .	enabling replicative immortality
12814188_s5	These cells showed a marked decrease of telomerase activity , growth rate and smooth muscle alpha-actin expressing myofibroblasts after the 32nd passage .	
12814188_s6	CM treatment of this fibroblast population induces a decline in the myofibroblast content , which precedes the changes in telomerase activity .	
12814188_s7	Passaged fibroblasts from normal breast tissue can be converted to myofibroblasts upon CM treatment whereas those from tumour stroma were CM-insensitive .	
12814188_s8	Taken together our data suggest that a heterogeneous fibroblast population with different life span is activated/recruited in the breast interstitium and poses the problem of a unique activation/recruitment of fibroblasts in neoplastic conditions .	
12814189_s0	Contradictory results have been reported regarding the association between vascularity ( used as an index of angiogenesis ) and thrombospondin-1 ( TSP-1 ) in human tumours .	
12814189_s1	In previous studies , the reported association was based on the estimated average TSP-1 value per tumour , with a sufficient number of specimens collectively analysed per tumour type .	
12814189_s2	Given the extent of intra-tumour heterogeneity , we determined the association between TSP-1 and vascularity within individual specimens , based on the average values of TSP-1 and vascularity in 10-20 pre-selected areas per tumour .	
12814189_s3	Cells expressing TSP-1 mRNA were visualised by in situ hybridisation and quantified by point counting .	
12814189_s4	Vascularity was quantified by point counting and vessel density of von Willebrand Factor-positive vessels .	
12814189_s5	In 10 ductal breast carcinomas , a direct correlation between TSP-1 and vascularity was found in 4 tumours , no correlation in 3 and an inverse correlation in 3 .	inducing angiogenesis
12814189_s6	The effect of TSP-1 on endothelial cell migration in vitro was assessed in the Boyden chamber assay .	
12814189_s7	TSP-1 stimulated cell migration at low concentrations ( 0.1-10 microg/ml ) and was inhibitory at high concentrations ( 25-100 microg/ml ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
12814189_s8	These results suggest that TSP-1 may elicit a concentration-dependent , bi-phasic , effect on angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
1281554_s0	Angiogenic factors produced by monocytes-macrophages are involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disorders characterized by persistent angiogenesis .	
1281554_s1	The possibility was tested that interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) , which is a cytokine that is chemotactic for lymphocytes and neutrophils , is also angiogenic .	
1281554_s2	Human recombinant IL-8 was potently angiogenic when implanted in the rat cornea and induced proliferation and chemotaxis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells .	inducing angiogenesis
1281554_s3	Angiogenic activity present in the conditioned media of inflamed human rheumatoid synovial tissue macrophages or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood monocytes was equally blocked by antibodies to either IL-8 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha .	inducing angiogenesis
1281554_s4	An IL-8 antisense oligonucleotide specifically blocked the production of monocyte-induced angiogenic activity .	inducing angiogenesis
1281554_s5	These data suggest a function for macrophage-derived IL-8 in angiogenesis-dependent disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis , tumor growth , and wound repair .	inducing angiogenesis
1282003_s0	We have observed previously that treatment of plateau-phase L5178Y murine lymphoblasts in vitro with 2'-deoxycoformycin plus deoxyadenosine ( dCF/dAdo ) can inhibit the repair of X-irradiation-induced DNA single-strand breaks ( SSB ) in these cells and that this effect is associated with synergistic cell kill .	
1282003_s1	In this study we examined the effect of a combination treatment of plateau-phase L5178Y cells with bleomycin ( BLM ) plus dCF/dAdo .	
1282003_s2	Incubation of BLM-treated cells with dCF/dAdo resulted in significant inhibition of the repair of BLM-induced DNA SSB .	genomic instability and mutation
1282003_s3	However , an additive , but not a synergistic , increase in cell kill was observed when cells were treated with a combination of BLM plus dCF/dAdo .	resisting cell death
12831059_s0	There is increasing evidence for the implication of tumor-derived angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors in controlling tumor growth in vivo .	
12831059_s1	In this study , we documented the production of inhibitors of angiogenesis by pancreatic cancer cells and examined how changes in the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors regulate tumor growth in vivo .	
12831059_s2	The human pancreatic cancer cell line Hs-776T ( HS-W ) produces slow-growing tumors in SCID mice .	
12831059_s3	Cells of a variant form ( HS-R ) of Hs-776T produced faster-growing tumors compared to HS-W .	
12831059_s4	Characterization of HS-W and HS-R cells in vitro showed similar proliferation rates and production of the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) .	inducing angiogenesis
12831059_s5	Analyzes of anti-angiogenic factors showed comparable levels of angiostatin and thrombospondin 1 and 2 , but endostatin was only detected in conditioned media of HS-W cells and was absent in HS-R .	inducing angiogenesis
12831059_s6	Cell proliferation was similar in both tumor types in vivo , whereas HS-W tumors demonstrated increased apoptosis with a high percentage of apoptotic endothelial cells ( EC ) .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
12831059_s7	Subsequently , VEGF was over-expressed in Hs-776T cells ( HS-VF ) , resulting in rapidly growing tumors and lowering tumor and EC apoptosis .	
12831059_s8	Collectively , our study confirms that tumor growth is dependent on its ability to increase the angiogenic stimulus or to reduce the amounts of endogenous anti-angiogenic factors .	inducing angiogenesis
1284834_s0	We have examined the effect of FK506 on the Adriamycin sensitivity of the multidrug resistant human chronic myelocytic leukemia cell line ( K562/ADM ) .	
1284834_s1	In K562/ADM cells , 1.0 microgram/ml FK506 reversed the resistance of Adriamycin , and increased the IC50 value for Adriamycin up to 17 fold .	
1284834_s2	However , IC50 value for the parent cells ( K562 ) increased only 1.5 fold .	
1284834_s3	By cell cycle analysis , the accumulation in late S-G2M phase was confirmed on K562/ADM cells , treated with 1.0 microgram/ml FK506 and low-dose of Adriamycin .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1284834_s4	Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) could also restored the Adriamycin sensitivity in the K562/ADM cells , as previously reported. 1.0 microgram/ml FK506 as well as CsA significantly increased radioactive Adriamycin accumulation in K562/ADM cells and blocked [ 3H]azidopien photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein .	
1284834_s5	These results suggest that 1.0 microgram/ml FK506 could reverse the Adriamycin resistance in a MDR human leukemia cells through the interaction with P-glycoprotein .	
12865633_s0	OBJECTIVES Epiphyseal cartilage is a barrier to osteosarcoma invasion , however the mechanisms behind this resistance remain unclear .	
12865633_s1	The aim of this study was to examine the chronological and spatial patterns of osteosarcoma growth and invasion of local tissue structures including epiphyseal cartilage .	
12865633_s2	METHODS We used an in vivomouse model of osteosarcoma to histologically examine tumors at different stages of disease progression .	
12865633_s3	We compared the pattern of osteosarcoma penetration of epiphyseal cartilage with the expression pattern of two potent mediators of angiogenesis ; proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and antiangiogenic pigment epithelium-derived factor ( PEDF ) .	
12865633_s4	RESULTS Epiphyseal cartilage remained intact across its entire length in all sections examined , despite increasing tumor size as well as intra- and extraosseous destruction .	
12865633_s5	In the most advanced cases , only the proangiogenic lowermost layers of the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate were eroded .	inducing angiogenesis
12865633_s6	This corresponded with the growth plate layers which highly expressed the angiogenic factor VEGF .	inducing angiogenesis
12865633_s7	In contrast , the resting , proliferative and upper hypertrophic layers were resistant to osteosarcoma invasion in all cases .	activating invasion and metastasis
12865633_s8	This corresponded to the layers with the highest expression of the potent antiangiogenic factor PEDF .	inducing angiogenesis
12865633_s9	CONCLUSION Epiphyseal cartilage is resistant to local invasion by osteosarcoma .	
12865633_s10	The balance of angiogenesis , influenced by pro- and antiangiogenic factors , is likely to play an important role in this resistance .	inducing angiogenesis
12882352_s0	Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been implicated in cellular senescence , apoptosis , aging and aging-associated pathologies .	
12882352_s1	Telomere shortening and genomic instability have also been associated with replicative senescence , aging and cancer .	
12882352_s2	Here we show that mitochondrial dysfunction leads to telomere attrition , telomere loss , and chromosome fusion and breakage , accompanied by apoptosis .	resisting cell death
12882352_s3	An antioxidant prevented telomere loss and genomic instability in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria , suggesting that reactive oxygen species are mediators linking mitochondrial dysfunction and genomic instability .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
12882352_s4	Further , nuclear transfer protected genomes from telomere dysfunction and promoted cell survival by reconstitution with functional mitochondria .	
12882352_s5	This work links mitochondrial dysfunction and genomic instability and may provide new therapeutic strategies to combat certain mitochondrial and aging-associated pathologies .	genomic instability and mutation
12889855_s0	We present a new cell line , EJ established from an invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus in a 56-year-old patient .	activating invasion and metastasis
12889855_s1	The cells show rapid growth in culture with a doubling time of 16 h and high migration activity .	activating invasion and metastasis
12889855_s2	Monolayer-cultured cells were polygonal in shape showing a tendency to pile up without contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
12889855_s3	Subcutaneous transplantation of the EJ cells into nude mice formed solid tumors that were histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma , whereas no metastasis was observed .	activating invasion and metastasis
12889855_s4	Cultured EJ cells produced tissue polypeptide antigen ( IPA ) .	
12889855_s5	Genetic and molecular analyses revealed high telomerase activity but not estrogen receptor alpha expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12889855_s6	Using the DNA sequencing technique , we have screened EJ cells for p53 mutation in exon 5 to 8 but no mutation of p53 was observed .	genomic instability and mutation
12889855_s7	This cell line appears to represent the development of a more malignant clone with divergent receptor function and growth behavior , and provides us with an interesting new tool for the study of tumorigenesis in the human endometrium .	
12903118_s0	We have studied the mutagenic specificity of abasic sites using the yeast oligonucleotides transformation assay .	
12903118_s1	We introduced oligonucleotide containing a natural abasic site and a tetrahydrofuran abasic site into Rev1 mutants , rev1AA , which contains mutations of Asp467 and Glu468 residues of Rev1p to Ala in order to inactivate dCMP transferase activity , and rev1 delta , which lacks its whole coding sequence .	
12903118_s2	The transformation efficiencies of rev1AA with abasic-containing oligonucleotides were lower than those of B7528 , a strain proficient in REV1 gene , but much higher than rev1 delta mutant .	genomic instability and mutation
12903118_s3	Sequence analysis opposite the lesions showed that the mutation spectra were different among these three strains .	genomic instability and mutation
12906318_s0	Vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) and its receptor tyrosine kinases located on endothelial cells seem to play an important role in the multistep pathway of angiogenesis .	
12906318_s1	SU5416 is a small molecule which inhibits angiogenesis by acting as an inhibitor of VEGF receptor-2 tyrosine kinase .	
12906318_s2	We have developed a reproducible murine model for neuroblastoma , a childhood cancer , based on s.c. xenotransplantation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells .	
12906318_s3	We found that SH-SY5Y cells expressed VEGF-A on both the mRNA and protein levels , that plasma concentrations of VEGF-A were significantly elevated in animals with neuroblastoma with a volume &gt ; 1.4 ml , and that there was a correlation between VEGF-A levels in plasma and tumor size in untreated tumor-bearing animals .	inducing angiogenesis
12906318_s4	Treatment with SU5416 reduced the growth of neuroblastoma tumors by 65% without apparent toxicity .	
12906318_s5	SU5416 treatment also suppressed tumor angiogenesis , despite an increase in plasma VEGF-A levels per ml tumor volume during therapy .	inducing angiogenesis
12906318_s6	Our experimental data suggest that the angiogenesis inhibitor SU5416 may be beneficial in the treatment of solid tumors of childhood such as neuroblastoma .	inducing angiogenesis
1294409_s0	Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and transforming growth factor alpha ( TGF alpha ) content was measured in normal ovaries and benign ovarian tumours .	
1294409_s1	Epidermal growth factor was present in 12.7% of normal ovaries , with a range 0.030-0.533 ng/mg DNA , and in 31.8% of benign ovarian tumours , with a range 0.1335-2.080 ng/ml DNA .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1294409_s2	TGF alpha was present in 84.5% of normal ovaries , with a range of values from 0.037-18.2 ng/mg DNA , and in 84.1% of benign ovarian tumours , with a range of 0.083-195 ng/mg DNA .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1294409_s3	The TGF alpha content in post menopausal benign ovarian tumours was significantly higher ( P &lt ; 0.0001 ) than TGF alpha in the pre-menopausal normal ovarian group .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1294409_s4	The frequency of detection and levels of TGF alpha measured were significantly higher than those of EGF in the normal ovary group ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) and also in the benign ovarian group ( P &lt ; 0.005 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1294409_s5	We conclude that TGF alpha is the predominant growth factor present in normal ovaries and benign ovarian tumours .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1306527_s0	The effects of high and low dietary fat ( 20% vs. 0.5% corn oil ) , and of the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor indomethacin ( 0.005% w/w ) , on tumour incidence , tumour growth , hormone-receptor status and growth-factor expression were examined in dimethylbenzanthracene ( DMBA)-induced rat breast cancer .	
1306527_s1	The high dietary-fat group showed a significantly higher tumour incidence , larger tumour size and larger number of bromodeoxyuridine(BrdU)-positive cells of tumours as compared with those in the low dietary-fat group .	
1306527_s2	Indomethacin reduced tumour incidence significantly , but conversely increased the tumour size and the number of BrdU-positive cells in both the high and the low dietary-fat groups .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1306527_s3	No significant difference was noted in the hormone-receptor status of the tumours .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1306527_s4	Growth factors ( TGF-alpha and IGF-II ) were somewhat highly expressed in the high dietary-fat group as compared with the low dietary-fat group , but indomethacin rather reduced the growth-factor expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1306527_s5	It is concluded that high dietary fat stimulates tumour incidence and tumour proliferation , while indomethacin has dual effects : a stimulating effect on tumour proliferation , but an inhibiting effect on tumour incidence .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1306527_s6	It is also suggested that hormone-receptor status and growth-factor expression do not play an important role in their stimulating effects on tumour proliferation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1312623_s0	Previous studies have shown that the E7 gene of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) type 16 or 18 alone was sufficient for immortalization of human foreskin epithelial cells ( HFE ) and that the efficiency was increased in cooperation with the respective E6 gene , whereas the HPV6 E6 or E7 gene was not active in HFE .	
1312623_s1	To detect weak immortalizing activities of the HPV6 genes , cells were infected with recombinant retroviruses containing HPV genes , alone and in homologous and heterologous combinations .	
1312623_s2	The HPV6 genes , alone or together ( HPV6 E6 plus HPV6 E7 ) , were not able to immortalize cells .	enabling replicative immortality
1312623_s3	However the HPV6 E6 gene , in concert with HPV16 E7 , increased the frequency of immortalization threefold over that obtained with HPV16 E7 alone .	enabling replicative immortality
1312623_s4	Interestingly , 6 of 20 clones containing the HPV16 E6 gene and the HPV6 E7 gene were immortalized , whereas neither gene alone was sufficient .	enabling replicative immortality
1312623_s5	Thus , the HPV6 E6 and E7 genes have weak immortalizing activities which can be detected in cooperation with the more active transforming genes of HPV16 .	enabling replicative immortality
1312623_s6	Acute expression of the HPV6 and HPV16 E6 and E7 genes revealed that only HPV16 E7 was able to stimulate the proliferation of cells in organotypic culture , resulting in increased expression of the proliferative cell nuclear antigen and the formation of a disorganized epithelial layer .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1312623_s7	Additionally , combinations of genes that immortalized HFE cells ( HPV16 E6 plus HPV16 E7 , HPV16 E6 plus HPV6 E7 , and HPV6 E6 plus HPV16 E7 ) also stimulated proliferation .	enabling replicative immortality
1312701_s0	The oncogenic potential of a human papillomavirus type 16 ( HPV16 ) variant cloned from normal human cervical keratinocytes has been tested in vitro using primary rodent epithelial cells and human cervical keratinocytes .	
1312701_s1	The HPV16 variant was able to extend the lifespan of , but failed to immortalize , human keratinocytes .	enabling replicative immortality
1312701_s2	It could however cooperate with an activated ras oncogene to transform primary rodent cells .	
1312701_s3	Radioimmunoprecipitation assays of the rodent cells showed that they expressed the E7 protein .	
1312701_s4	DNA sequence analysis of the URR/E6/E7 and E5 regions of the HPV16 showed them to be fully functional , but a deletion in the viral E2 open reading frame was detected .	
1312701_s5	This truncated E2 only weakly stimulated transcription of the viral regulatory region .	
1312701_s6	Complementation assays using the HPV16 variant and a full-length E2 enabled the cloned variant to immortalize human cervical keratinocytes with wild-type efficiency .	enabling replicative immortality
1312701_s7	These results suggest that other viral gene products in addition to E6/E7 may play an important role in the in vitro immortalization of cervical keratinocytes in HPV16 and the development of cervical cancer .	enabling replicative immortality
1313584_s0	The " high-risk " human papillomavirus types 16 ( HPV-16 ) and 18 ( HPV-18 ) have been etiologically implicated in the majority of human cervical carcinomas .	
1313584_s1	In these cancers , the viral DNAs are often integrated into the host genome so that expression of the E1 and the E2 genes is lost , suggesting that disruption of these regulatory genes plays an important role in carcinogenic progression .	
1313584_s2	Previous studies defining the viral genes affecting HPV-16 transformation functions have used the " prototype " viral genome , which was cloned from a human cervical carcinoma and later discovered to harbor a mutation in the E1 gene .	
1313584_s3	In this study , we have corrected this mutation and have evaluated the effect of mutations of either the E1 or the E2 gene on the efficiency of HPV-16 immortalization of human keratinocytes .	
1313584_s4	Mutation of either the E1 gene or the E2 gene in the background of a " wild-type " HPV-16 genome markedly increased immortalization capacity .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
1313584_s5	Mutations were also generated in the E2-binding sites located upstream of the P97 promoter , which directs synthesis of the viral E6 and E7 transforming genes .	genomic instability and mutation
1313584_s6	E2 negatively regulates the P97 promoter through binding at adjacent sites .	
1313584_s7	Surprisingly , the mutation of these sites only partially relieved the negative effect of E2 on viral immortalization , implicating additional mechanisms in the E2 repression of viral immortalization functions .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
1313584_s8	Our results provide genetic evidence that the E1 and E2 gene products each can repress HPV-16 immortalization and support the hypothesis that a selective growth advantage is provided by integration of the viral genome in a manner that causes the loss of expression of either E1 or E2 .	enabling replicative immortality
1318401_s0	Human papillomavirus type 16 ( HPV16 ) E6 and E7 are selectively retained and expressed in HPV16-associated human genital tumors .	
1318401_s1	E6 is active in several cell culture assays , including transformation of NIH 3T3 cells , trans activation of the adenovirus E2 promoter , and cooperation with E7 to immortalize normal human keratinocytes .	
1318401_s2	Biochemically , the HPV16 E6 protein has been shown to bind to tumor suppressor protein p53 in vitro and induce its degradation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate .	
1318401_s3	To examine the relationship between the various biological activities of E6 and inactivation of p53 , we tested the abilities of dominant negative mutants of p53 to substitute functionally for E6 in the three cell culture assays .	
1318401_s4	While wild-type p53 inhibited keratinocyte proliferation , both mouse and human mutant p53s , in conjunction with E7 , increased proliferation of the keratinocytes , resulting in generation of immortalized lines .	enabling replicative immortality
1318401_s5	However , in contrast to E6 , mutant p53 was unable to induce transformation or trans activate the adenovirus E2 promoter in NIH 3T3 cells .	
1318401_s6	These results suggest that inactivation of wild-type p53 is necessary for HPV-induced immortalization of human keratinocytes and that different or additional activities are required for E6-dependent transformation and trans activation of NIH 3T3 cells .	enabling replicative immortality
1318961_s0	In order to determine the in vivo immune response in glioblastoma , monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific for inflammatory leukocytes and immunoregulatory products were utilized to stain tissue from four surgical specimens .	
1318961_s1	The more activated the inflammatory cells , the more activated the tumors appeared to be .	
1318961_s2	In the tumor with the largest infiltration ( Case 3 ) , inflammatory cells were stained for interferon-gamma , interleukin-2 , interleukin-1 beta , lymphotoxin , tumor necrosis factor-alpha , and transforming growth factor-beta .	
1318961_s3	The tumor cells also expressed interleukin-1 beta , interleukin-6 , transforming growth factor-beta , tumor necrosis factor-alpha , and prostaglandin E. In contrast , in the tumor with the least inflammatory response ( Case 1 ) , the tumor cells did not express any cytokines .	
1318961_s4	Expression of cytokines by glioma cells was modest in the two cases with modest inflammatory responses .	
1318961_s5	Cellular inflammation , primarily consisting of T cells and macrophages with few or no B cells or natural killer cells , was two- to 15-fold greater outside the tumor than within .	
1318961_s6	In contrast to leukocytes outside the tumor , which were activated and expressing class II major histocompatibility antigens , leukocytes within the tumor parenchyma or at the tumor's edge were negative for these antigens .	
1318961_s7	In the four specimens studied here , the tumor cells themselves were also negative for class II major histocompatibility antigens .	
1318961_s8	These findings , although preliminary , suggest that inflammatory cells within gliomas are inactivated and that glioma cells may increase the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines in response to an increased lymphocyte infiltrate .	avoiding immune destruction,tumor promoting inflammation
1318961_s9	This observation , if corroborated by more extensive studies , may help to explain the failure of immune treatments in glioblastoma multiforme .	
1319408_s0	NIH-3T3 cells are non-tumorigenic when injected into athymic mice .	
1319408_s1	If these cells are mixed with an extract of basement-membrane proteins ( matrigel ) and injected s.c. , they form locally invasive and highly vascularized tumors .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
1319408_s2	Cells cultured from the NIH-3T3-matrigel-induced tumors showed a transformed phenotype and lacked contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
1319408_s3	When cultured in a gel of matrigel , they proliferated and formed branched and invasive colonies .	activating invasion and metastasis
1319408_s4	In contrast , the parental NIH-3T3 cells cultured on matrigel remained as cell aggregates and were not invasive .	activating invasion and metastasis
1319408_s5	I.V. injections of the tumor-derived NIH-3T3 cells produced many colonies on the surface of the lungs , whereas the parental NIH-3T3 cells were not metastatic .	activating invasion and metastasis
1319408_s6	Zymographic analysis of the conditioned media obtained from both the tumor-derived and parental NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated higher amounts of the 72-kDa gelatinase ( type-IV collagenase ) enzyme in the tumor-derived cells .	
1319408_s7	Also , tumor-derived NIH-3T3 cells , but not parental NIH-3T3 cells , secreted the 92-kDa type-IV collagenase .	
1319408_s8	These studies suggest that the interaction of pre-malignant NIH-3T3 cells with extracellular matrix components may contribute to the process of tumor progression .	
1328588_s0	Elevated serum levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) are associated with some cases of neuroblastoma and correlate with a favorable prognosis .	
1328588_s1	VIP has previously been shown in our laboratory to cause the in vitro growth inhibition and morphological differentiation of the human neuroblastoma cell line , LA-N-5 .	
1328588_s2	It is now shown that LA-N-5 cells express immunoreactive VIP and bear specific VIP receptors .	
1328588_s3	Antagonism of endogenous VIP , either by competitive inhibition or receptor blockade , increased cell proliferation , suggesting that VIP is operative in normal growth regulation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1328588_s4	Intracellular and extracellular levels of VIP were also shown to increase significantly during the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of these cells .	
1328588_s5	Furthermore , a concomitant marked increase in VIP receptor expression was demonstrated with cellular differentiation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1328588_s6	These receptors remain functional as evidenced by a matching increase in the level of detectable cAMP generated in response to exogenous VIP .	
1328588_s7	It is concluded that VIP is a normal autoregulator of neuroblastoma cell growth and differentiation , and that retinoic acid-mediated differentiation may be , in part , due to endogenous VIP .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1330343_s0	Retrovirally induced immunosuppression may elevate the incidence of chemically induced cancers .	
1330343_s1	A proposed hypothesis to explain this relationship is the increased free radical activity observed during retroviral infection and carcinogen activation .	
1330343_s2	We previously found that vitamin E retarded growth of esophageal tumors accompanied by reductions of free radical products .	
1330343_s3	This study investigated the contribution that retroviral immunosuppression has on esophageal cancer induced by the carcinogen N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine ( NMBzA ) , and the response that increased levels of dietary vitamin E has on this induced carcinogenesis .	
1330343_s4	Female C57BL/6 mice received NMBzA or vehicle ( corn oil ) i.p. weekly for 3 weeks .	
1330343_s5	Then some of the mice were infected with LP-BM5 murine retrovirus and fed diets containing 30 IU vitamin E or 172 IU vitamin E/kg of diet .	
1330343_s6	As an assessment of free radical activity , exhaled ethane was measured prior to killing the animals at 26 weeks .	
1330343_s7	Esophagi from the various mice groups were assessed for size and frequency of tumors .	
1330343_s8	Livers homogenates were analyzed for vitamins A and E , lipid fluorescence , conjugated dienes and malondialdehyde .	
1330343_s9	Hepatic levels of vitamin A and E were decreased ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) and indices of lipid peroxidation were greater ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) in NMBzA-treated mice relative to controls .	
1330343_s10	Lipid peroxidation and serum transaminases ( ALT and AST ) were greatest in mice given NMBzA and infected with the retroviruses .	
1330343_s11	Incidence of esophageal tumors were also greatest in the NMBzA-treated , immunocompromised animals .	avoiding immune destruction
1330343_s12	Mice fed vitamin E-supplemented diets showed increased ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) hepatic concentrations of vitamin E and vitamin A , decreased activities of serum transaminases , decreased indices of lipid peroxidation , and decreased size and frequency of esophageal tumors in both the immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised mice .	avoiding immune destruction
1330343_s13	These results suggest that vitamin E plays an antioxidant function that retards the incidence of esophageal cancers in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised animals .	avoiding immune destruction
1332809_s0	The immune status of spleen and the effect of surgical treatment in advanced gastric cancer ( AGC ) patients were evaluated by means of testing NK cell activity , T-lymphocyte subsets and circulating immune complex ( CIC ) .	
1332809_s1	The results showed ( 1 ) the significant impairment of NK cell activity and T-lymphocyte subsets , were decreased in CD3+ , CD4+ cells and increased in CD6+ cells resulting in CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) , splenic venous blood lymphocytes ( SVL ) and spleen cells ( SC ) of AGC , as compared with PBL of normal population ; ( 2 ) NK cell activity or CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio of SVL and SC were significantly lower than those of PBL in AGC patients , mainly caused by marked decrease of CD4+ cells in SC ; ( 3 ) NK cell activity , CD4+ cells and CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio were significantly elevated in most of AGC cases receiving either radical gastrectomy ( R2+ ) or extensive radical gastrectomy ( R3 ) .	avoiding immune destruction
1332809_s2	A striking declination in CD8+ cells were found only after R3 operation ; ( 4 ) after a short period ( 10-14 days ) or a long period ( 2-4 years ) of radical gastrectomy , NK cell activity and T-lymphocyte subsets showed no significant differences between R2+ and R3 operation .	
1332809_s3	As a rule , AGC would weaken immune function of patients , and along with the development of the tumor , the immunosuppression in the spleen would be generated gradually .	avoiding immune destruction
1332809_s4	For these reasons , a complete tumor resection would be necessary to improve the immunocompetence , and the combined splenectomy might be advisable if indicated .	
1334154_s0	BACKGROUND Although chemotherapy offers promise of increased survival for children with medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme , drug resistance occurs frequently , resulting in tumor progression and death .	
1334154_s1	Resistance to nitrosoureas and methylating agents , which damage DNA , can be mediated by a DNA repair protein , O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase ( AGAT ) .	
1334154_s2	Depletion of this protein with alkylguanines or methylating agents , however , restores tumor cell sensitivity to the cytotoxicity of chloroethylnitrosoureas ( e.g. , carmustine [ BCNU] ) .	
1334154_s3	PURPOSE This study was designed to determine whether resistance to the activity of nitrosourea ( the drug BCNU ) in BCNU-resistant human medulloblastoma ( D341 Med ) and human glioblastoma multiforme ( D-456 MG ) can be reversed by the methylating agent streptozocin and the O6-substituted guanines O6-methylguanine and O6-benzylguanine .	
1334154_s4	METHODS Xenografts were grown subcutaneously in athymic BALB/c mice .	
1334154_s5	BCNU was administered as a single intraperitoneal injection at doses of 100 mg/m2 , 75 mg/m2 , or 38 mg/m2--i.e. , 1.0 , 0.75 , or 0.38 , respectively , of the dose lethal to 10% of treated animals ( LD10 ) .	
1334154_s6	Mice were treated intraperitoneally with a single dose of O6-benzylguanine or O6-methylguanine ( 240 mg/m2 ) or with streptozocin ( 600 mg/m2 ) daily for 4 days .	
1334154_s7	Response was assessed by tumor growth delay and tumor regression .	
1334154_s8	AGAT activity in the xenografts was measured at 1 and 6 hours after pretreatment , at the time tumors were excised .	
1334154_s9	RESULTS Pretreatment with O6-benzylguanine , O6-methylguanine , or streptozocin reduced AGAT activity to 4% , 25% , and 95% of control values , respectively , in D341 Med and 0% , 0% , and 25% of control values , respectively , in D-456 MG 1 hour after injection .	genomic instability and mutation
1334154_s10	After 6 hours , levels changed to 7% , 61% , and 116% of control values in D341 Med and 0% , 79% , and 21% of control values in D-456 MG , respectively .	
1334154_s11	Both D341 Med and D-456 MG xenografts were completely resistant to BCNU at its LD10 .	
1334154_s12	Pretreatment with O6-benzylguanine increased BCNU sensitivity in both types of xenograft .	
1334154_s13	In contrast , treatment with BCNU plus O6-methylguanine or streptozocin did not produce growth delays substantially different from those produced by BCNU alone , reflecting the more efficient depletion of AGAT by O6-benzylguanine .	
1334154_s14	Following therapy with BCNU plus O6-benzylguanine at 0.38 LD10 , tumor regressions were seen in eight of 10 D341 Med and in all 10 D-456 MG xenografts .	
1334154_s15	CONCLUSION We recommend comprehensive clinical toxicologic evaluation of combination therapy with O6-benzylguanine plus BCNU , which would allow subsequent design of phase I clinical trials .	
1336179_s0	Semi-conservative replication of double-stranded DNA in eukaryotic cells is an asymmetric process involving leading and lagging strand synthesis and different DNA polymerases .	
1336179_s1	We report a study to analyze the effect of these asymmetries when the replication machinery encounters alkylation-induced DNA adducts .	
1336179_s2	The model system is an EBV-derived shuttle vector which replicates in synchrony with the host human cells and carries as marker gene the bacterial gpt gene .	
1336179_s3	A preferential distribution of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea ( MNU)-induced mutations in the non transcribed DNA strand of the shuttle vector pF1-EBV was previously reported .	
1336179_s4	The hypermutated strand was the leading strand .	
1336179_s5	To test whether the different fidelity of DNA polymerases synthesizing the leading and the lagging strands might contribute to MNU-induced mutation distribution the mutagenesis study was repeated on the shuttle vector pTF-EBV which contains the gpt gene in the inverted orientation .	
1336179_s6	We show that the base substitution error rates on an alkylated substrate are similar for the replication of the leading and lagging strands .	genomic instability and mutation
1336179_s7	Moreover , we present evidence that the fidelity of replication opposite O6-methylguanine adducts of both the leading and lagging strands is not affected by the 3 ' flanking base .	genomic instability and mutation
1336179_s8	The preferential targeting of mutations after replication of alkylated DNA is mainly driven by the base at the 5 ' side of the G residues .	genomic instability and mutation
1337999_s0	The involvement of signal transduction systems in the initial attachment of two murine B16 melanoma clones of differing metastatic potential to extracellular matrix components was examined to learn more of the early events in cell-matrix interaction .	
1337999_s1	Clones of high and low metastatic capacity attached similarly in the absence of any stimulators , exhibiting a two phase time course of attachment with 100% attachment by 60 min .	
1337999_s2	A slight difference in attachment characteristics between the clones was seen in response to phorbol ester stimulation , which significantly inhibited attachment of the low metastatic clone but which had no effect on the highly metastatic clone .	activating invasion and metastasis
1337999_s3	Total protein kinase C activity and distribution was similar for both clones .	
1337999_s4	Attachment of both clones was severely reduced , however , if intracellular calcium was elevated or intracellular calmodulin inhibited .	
1337999_s5	This study suggests that signal transduction mechanisms are involved in melanoma cell attachment to matrix proteins and offers an approach to pharmacological manipulation of these cell-matrix interactions which may be relevant to reducing metastatic spread .	activating invasion and metastasis
1338304_s0	Normal human lung fibroblast diploid cells , WI-38 , become senescent after a definite number of divisions .	
1338304_s1	VA-13 is a line of immortalized cells established by transformation of WI-38 cells by SV40 virus .	
1338304_s2	To determine whether SV40 large T ( SV40-T ) antigen is essential for this immortalization of WI-38 cells we introduced an antisense gene for T antigen into VA-13 .	
1338304_s3	Two morphologically different types of antisense transformant ( VA-AS5-8 and VA-AS37-8 ) were obtained .	
1338304_s4	In both antisense transformants the expression of T antigen was reduced by more than 70% as compared to that in the parent cells .	
1338304_s5	The morphology of the antisense transformants indicated a partial conversion to the senescent phenotype of WI-38 .	enabling replicative immortality
1338304_s6	The relative number of cells in the S phase of the antisense transformants was decreased as compared to that in cultures of VA-13 and about 50% of cells were at G1/0 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1338304_s7	The doubling time of the transformants was prolonged to close to the doubling time of WI-38 .	
1338304_s8	The level of expression of retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) complexed with SV40-T antigen of the antisense transformants was significantly decreased although the level of total pRB was much higher than that in VA-13 .	
1338304_s9	The pRB was present exclusively in the underphosphorylated form .	
1338304_s10	Thus , the decreased level of formation of the complex between SV40-T and pRB or the underphosphorylation of pRB may explain the suppression of growth of antisense transformants .	
1338304_s11	Together , these results show that an antisense gene for SV40-T antigen can efficiently block the cell proliferation and the cell immortalization of VA-13 cells .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
1348967_s0	c-myc , c-erbB-2 , and Ki-67 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 11 normal breast tissues and 42 invasive and 14 noninvasive breast carcinomas .	
1348967_s1	The c-myc product was detected in all breast carcinoma specimens and in 7 of 11 normal breast tissues .	
1348967_s2	Invasive tumors stained more frequently with the anti-myc monoclonal antibody than did noninvasive tumors , while the level of expression in normal breast tissue was much less than that in breast cancer .	
1348967_s3	Membrane staining of the c-erbB-2 protein was demonstrated in 29% ( 4 of 14 ) of noninvasive ductal carcinomas and in 45% ( 19 of 42 ) of invasive breast carcinomas .	
1348967_s4	None of the 11 normal breast tissue samples was positive .	
1348967_s5	The mean value of Ki-67-positive cells was 0.91 +/- 0.31% for normal breast tissue , 4.57 +/- 1.36% for noninvasive ductal carcinoma , and 12.76 +/- 2.18% for invasive breast cancer .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1348967_s6	In 42 invasive breast carcinomas , the expression of c-myc , c-erbB-2 , and Ki-67 proliferation marker were compared with lymph node status , estrogen receptor status , progesterone receptor status , and age of patients at diagnosis. c-erbB-2 overexpression and Ki-67 overexpression were identified as the only factors associated with lymph node status .	
1348967_s7	We concluded that they might be additional prognostic factors for breast carcinoma .	
1354082_s0	The modifying effects of an immunosuppressive agent , 6-mercaptopurine ( 6-MP ) , on development of focal lesions in liver cirrhosis models induced by carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) or furfural were studied in male F344 rats .	
1354082_s1	Feeding of 6-MP at 50 p.p.m. for 20 weeks to animals with pre-existing liver cirrhosis caused immunosuppression , and significantly enhanced the induction of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase ( GGT)-positive foci and nodules in the CCl4 but not furfural case .	avoiding immune destruction
1354082_s2	Glutathione S-transferase P ( GST-P)-positive preneoplastic lesions were not affected .	
1354082_s3	Moreover , phenobarbital ( PB ) also enhanced the induction of GGT-positive hepatocellular lesions only in the CCl4-induced liver cirrhosis model , no promotion influence being exerted after treatment with the non-carcinogenic furfural .	
1354082_s4	This study , therefore , suggests that 6-MP can enhance the induction of one type of preneoplastic foci and nodules and that essential differences exist between focal lesions arising in cirrhotic livers caused by CCl4 as opposed to furfural .	
1354348_s0	Amplification of the HER-2 ( c-erbB-2 ) gene and overexpression of the p185HER-2 gene product is found in approximately one-third of primary human breast and ovarian cancers and is associated with a poor clinical outcome of early relapse and death .	
1354348_s1	The HER-2 gene encodes a cell-surface growth factor receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity .	
1354348_s2	Wild-type human HER-2 has been shown to act as a potent oncogene when over-expressed in mouse fibroblasts .	
1354348_s3	Recent data suggest that the mechanism by which HER-2 mediates transformation requires the interaction of the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor .	
1354348_s4	To test whether overexpression of normal human HER-2 can transform cells independently of the EGF receptor , we have introduced multiple copies of HER-2 into the EGF receptor-negative cell line , NR6 , and have performed assays for both transformation and tumorigenicity .	
1354348_s5	Engineered NR6 cells that overexpress the HER-2 gene product display a highly transformed and tumorigenic phenotype as compared with control cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1354348_s6	Additionally , a monoclonal antibody to the extracellular domain of the HER-2 receptor is able to inhibit the proliferation of the overexpressing cells in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1354348_s7	This study provides clear evidence that HER-2-mediated transformation can be achieved independently of the EGF receptor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1358983_s0	One of the immunosuppressive effects of both ultraviolet ( UV ) light and chemical carcinogens is to deplete Langerhans cells ( LC ) from the epidermis , suggesting that these cells play an important role in inducing immune responses to developing tumors during the early phases of carcinogenesis .	
1358983_s1	Retinoids such as all-trans-retinoic acid ( RA ) are natural or synthetic derivatives of vitamin A ; RA binds to nuclear receptors in the skin , effecting transcription of a wide range of genes .	
1358983_s2	Topical application of RA prevents the tumor promotor 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA ) from depleting the density of LC in murine epidermis .	
1358983_s3	In contrast , topical RA did not itself alter the normal LC density .	
1358983_s4	RA also inhibited the development of TPA-induced immunosuppression to a locally applied contact sensitizer .	avoiding immune destruction
1358983_s5	Topical RA also prevented UV light from reducing the density of both LC and Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells ( Thy-1+ dEC ) .	
1358983_s6	However , the RA treatment did not prevent local immunosuppression to the contact sensitizer from developing in response to UV irradiation .	avoiding immune destruction
1358983_s7	The reasons for this are unclear , however , it is possible that RA does not inhibit some other immunosuppressive effect of UV light .	avoiding immune destruction
1358983_s8	Temarotene , a recently developed synthetic retinoid also inhibited UV light from reducing the LC and Thy-1+ dEC density from murine epidermis .	
1358983_s9	Thus part of the anti-carcinogenic activity of retinoids may be due to their ability to protect LC during the early stages of carcinogenesis .	
1361306_s0	Results generated by the immunohistochemical staining with PC10 , a new monoclonal antibody recognizing PCNA ( a nuclear protein associated with cell proliferation ) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue were compared with those of Ki-67 labeling and DNA flow cytometry in 47 consecutive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .	
1361306_s1	PCNA reactivity was observed in all samples and confined to the nuclei of cancer cells .	
1361306_s2	Its frequency ranged from 0 to 80% ( 37.7 +/- 23.6 ) and larger sized , early-staged and DNA aneuploid tumors expressed a significant higher number of PCNA-reactive cells .	
1361306_s3	The PCNA and Ki-67 labeling rates were closely correlated ( r = 0.383 , P = 0.009 ) .	
1361306_s4	By flow cytometry , we observed a good correlation among PCNA labeling and S-phase fraction ( r = 0.422 , P = .0093 ) and G1 phase ( r = 0.303 , P = .051 ) of the cell cycle .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1361306_s5	Results indicate that PCNA labeling with PC10 is a simple method for assessing the proliferative activity in formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue of NSCLC and correlates well with Ki-67 labeling and S-phase fraction of the cell cycle .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1363346_s0	HER-2/neu gene expression , DNA ploidy and proliferation index were studied in 250 cases of breast cancer .	
1363346_s1	Expression of HER-2/neu was determined by using an antibody to the HER-2/neu receptor .	
1363346_s2	Ki-67 antibody was used to determine the proliferation index of the breast cancers , and the Feulgen method was used to assess DNA amounts in the tumor cells .	
1363346_s3	Histochemical staining was quantitated by image analysis .	
1363346_s4	Of the cancers studied , 72 were positive for overexpression of HER-2/neu protein ; of these , 62 ( 86% ) possessed near-tetraploid DNA content , and 47 ( 65% ) had more than one G0G1 stem line ( polyploid ) of DNA distribution .	
1363346_s5	Cells from the cases negative for HER/2-neu overexpression contained DNA amounts that ranged from diploid to varying degrees of aneuploid .	
1363346_s6	A significant difference in the amounts of cellular proliferation in HER-2/neu overexpressing cancers was found between those that expressed the HER-2/neu receptor on their membranes and those that exhibited mainly cytoplasmic receptors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1365325_s0	Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) produced by phagocytic cells induce oxidative stress during chronic inflammation .	
1365325_s1	ROS play a role in the pathogenesis of a broad range of diseases including autoimmune , cardiac and neoplastic abnormalities .	
1365325_s2	We found that sera of patients with a variety of inflammatory dermatoses contain elevated levels of antibodies ( Ab ) binding to an oxidized DNA base derivative , 5-hydroxymethyl-2'deoxyuridine ( HMdU ) coupled to bovine serum albumin , as determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .	tumor promoting inflammation
1365325_s3	Patients with immune complex diseases and a history of neoplasm elaborated the highest titers of anti-HMdU Ab .	
1365325_s4	Titers from sera of psoriatic subjects were lower than from the aforementioned groups but were still significantly elevated ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) above those of healthy controls .	
1365325_s5	Treatment of inflammatory dermatoses with systemic antiinflammatory and cytotoxic drugs significantly lowered the titers [ p &lt ; 0.005 ( immune complex ) or p &lt ; 0.001 ( psoriasis and neoplastic ) diseases ] , suggesting that this assay may be of value in monitoring the response to therapy in these diseases .	tumor promoting inflammation
1370093_s0	A panel of primary human cells and virus-transformed derivatives were tested for events that coincide with immortalization .	
1370093_s1	In all primary and precrisis cells , two proteins of 92 and 150 kDa that shared an epitope with p53 were found ; in most of their immortalized derivatives , however , they were absent .	enabling replicative immortality
1370093_s2	Expression of these proteins may be involved in senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
1371284_s0	Lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) plays a central role in normal lipid metabolism as the key enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides present in chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins .	
1371284_s1	LPL is a member of a family of hydrolytic enzymes that include hepatic lipase and pancreatic lipase .	
1371284_s2	Based on primary sequence homology of LPL to pancreatic lipase , Ser-132 , Asp-156 , and His-241 have been proposed to be part of a domain required for normal enzymic activity .	
1371284_s3	We have analyzed the role of these potential catalytic residues by site-directed mutagenesis and expression of the mutant LPL in human embryonic kidney-293 cells .	
1371284_s4	Substitution of Ser-132 , Asp-156 , and His-241 by several different residues resulted in the expression of an enzyme that lacked both triolein and tributyrin esterase activities .	
1371284_s5	Mutation of other conserved residues , including Ser-97 , Ser-307 , Asp-78 , Asp-371 , Asp-440 , His-93 , and His-439 resulted in the expression of active enzymes .	genomic instability and mutation
1371284_s6	Despite their effect on LPL activity , substitutions of Ser-132 , Asp-156 , and His-241 did not change either the heparin affinity or lipid binding properties of the mutant LPL .	
1371284_s7	In summary , mutation of Ser-132 , Asp-156 , and His-241 specifically abolishes total hydrolytic activity without disrupting other important functional domains of LPL .	genomic instability and mutation
1371284_s8	These combined results strongly support the conclusion that Ser-132 , Asp-156 , and His-241 form the catalytic triad of LPL and are essential for LPL hydrolytic activity .	
1373811_s0	Human diploid fibroblasts have a limited life span in vitro , and spontaneous immortalization is an extremely rare event .	
1373811_s1	We have used transformation of human diploid fibroblasts by an origin-defective simian virus 40 genome to develop series of genetically matched immortal cell lines to analyze immortalization .	
1373811_s2	Comparison of a preimmortal transformant ( SVtsA/HF-A ) with its uncloned and cloned immortalized derivatives ( AR5 and HAL ) has failed to reveal any major alteration involving the simian virus 40 genome .	
1373811_s3	Karyotypic analysis , however , demonstrated that all of the immortal cell lines in this series have alterations of chromosome 6 involving loss of the portion distal to 6q21 .	enabling replicative immortality
1373811_s4	The karyotypic analysis was corroborated by DNA analyses .	
1373811_s5	Southern analysis demonstrated that only one copy of three proto-oncogene loci ( ros1 , c-myb , and mas1 ) on 6q was retained in immortal cells .	enabling replicative immortality
1373811_s6	Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the microsatellite polymorphism at 6q22 ( D6S87 ) showed loss of heterozygosity .	
1373811_s7	In addition , elevated expression of c-myb ( 6q22-23 ) was observed .	
1373811_s8	We hypothesize that the region at and/or distal to 6q21 plays a role in immortalization , consistent with the presence of a growth suppressor gene .	enabling replicative immortality
1378293_s0	A new cell line , CB109 , has been established from a human glioblastoma multiforme .	
1378293_s1	The cytoskeleton was positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein , vimentin and fibronectin .	
1378293_s2	Hyaluronan ( HA ) and the HA-binding protein hyaluronectin ( HN ) were expressed in the cell cytoplasm and in the extracellular matrix of spheroids and plated cells .	
1378293_s3	Hyaluronidase did not prevent spheroid formation suggesting that HA was not involved in the cell-cell adhesion .	
1378293_s4	HA precoating prevented cell adherence to the plates and favoured spheroid formation .	
1378293_s5	HA was secreted in relatively large amounts into the culture medium .	
1378293_s6	High performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that HA was in the high molecular weight form .	
1378293_s7	The rate of HN secretion by cells was very low .	
1378293_s8	Basic fibroblast growth factor significantly increased the proliferation in vitro and tumour growth after grafting into nude mice .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1378293_s9	The epidermal growth factor receptor was not expressed on cultivated CB109 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1378293_s10	Cytogenetic analysis showed polysomy 7 , structural rearrangement of chromosome 10 short arm and a translocation 13q13-q14 without detectable alteration of the RB gene .	
1384375_s0	Among salivary gland neoplasms are a group of rare tumors that are histologically identical to benign mixed tumors that inexplicably metastasize ; they have been called metastasizing mixed tumor ( MZMT ) of salivary glands .	
1384375_s1	We report the clinicopathologic features and flow cytometric findings for 11 cases of MZMT .	
1384375_s2	At the time of discovery of metastatic disease , the patients , six women and five men , ranged in age from 20 to 83 years .	
1384375_s3	Primary sites of involvement included the parotid gland ( eight cases ) , submandibular gland ( two cases ) , and the nasal septum ( one case ) .	
1384375_s4	With one exception , all the patients had at least a single recurrences of their primary mixed tumor , but two or more recurrences were the norm before development of metastatic foci .	activating invasion and metastasis
1384375_s5	The metastases were discovered from six to 52 years following the occurrence of the primary tumor .	activating invasion and metastasis
1384375_s6	Metastatic deposits were identified in bone , lung , regional lymph nodes , skin , kidney , retroperitoneum , oral cavity , pharynx , calvarium , and central nervous system .	activating invasion and metastasis
1384375_s7	The metastases either occurred simultaneously with an episode of recurrent mixed tumor ( n = 5 ) or from 5 to 29 years after a recurrence ( n = 6 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
1384375_s8	The treatment of the primary , recurrent , and metastatic neoplasms was surgical excision .	
1384375_s9	Follow-up , ranging from 8 months to 16 years following the diagnosis of MZMT , revealed seven patients to be alive without disease ( 64% ) and two dead of causes unrelated to metastatic disease ( 18% ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
1384375_s10	Two patients ( 18% ) died as a direct result of metastatic tumor at 3 and 2 years after metastasis of their mixed tumors .	activating invasion and metastasis
1384375_s11	Flow cytometric analysis revealed a diploid DNA cell population in the primary and/or metastatic tumors in nine cases .	activating invasion and metastasis
1384375_s12	Aneuploid DNA cell content was identified in two of the cases .	genomic instability and mutation
1384375_s13	DNA ploidy levels and cell proliferation rates were compared with those of conventional benign mixed tumors and also with malignant mixed tumors .	genomic instability and mutation
1384375_s14	Retrospective analysis of histologic parameters ( mitotic rate , cellular pleomorphism , infiltrative growth , vascular or lymphatic invasion ) and flow cytometric analysis failed to identify criteria to predict the development of metastasis in these neoplasms .	activating invasion and metastasis
1394185_s0	Despite an increasing incidence of human breast cancer , its etiology remains unknown .	
1394185_s1	Since some environmental chemicals are stored in human breast fat and are rodent mammary carcinogens , determining the genotoxic potential of environmental agents in this key target tissue is important .	
1394185_s2	An assay was developed for detecting genotoxic activity , as unscheduled DNA synthesis ( UDS ) , induced by chemicals and UV radiation in early passage cultures of normal human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) derived from 5 different women .	
1394185_s3	In order to measure UDS in culture , reduction in the percentage of cells in S-phase was accomplished either by depriving the cells of epidermal growth factor and bovine pituitary extract or by contact inhibition of growth .	
1394185_s4	Cultures were incubated with test chemicals for 24 h in the presence of [ 3H]-thymidine .	
1394185_s5	UDS was quantitated autoradiographically as net grains per nucleus ( nuclear grains minus cytoplasmic background , population average ) with &gt ; or = 6 net nuclear grains considered in repair for any individual cell .	
1394185_s6	A positive response was observed with UV radiation , benzo(a)-pyrene , aflatoxin B1 , ethylmethanesulfonate , 1,6-dinitropyrene , 2-acetylaminofluorene , and tobacco smoke condensate but not 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin .	
1394185_s7	These results demonstrate that HMEC from all 5 women examined have the ability to metabolize a variety of environmental chemicals to DNA-reactive forms .	
1394185_s8	Furthermore , some chemicals known either to cause mammary cancer in rodents or to be contaminants in human breast tissue are genotoxic in HMEC .	genomic instability and mutation
1394185_s9	A positive response in passage 9 cultures was observed only with direct acting agents , suggesting that HMEC may lose their metabolic capabilities in longer-term cultures .	
1394185_s10	The HMEC UDS assay may be used to address the role of environmental agents in human breast cancer by determining whether chemicals are DNA reactive or metabolized to DNA reactive species in this critical target tissue .	genomic instability and mutation
1394217_s0	DNA single-strand breaks and associated growth inhibition induced by the thymidylate synthase inhibitor N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazoline-6-ylmethyl)-N -methylamino]-2 - thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid ( ICI D1694 ) were quantitated using the human ileocecal adenocarcinoma cell line , HCT-8 .	
1394217_s1	The effects of different concentrations and schedules of [ 6R,S]-5-formyltetrahydrofolate ( [ 6RS]LV ) and 2'-deoxy-thymidine ( dThd ) on drug growth inhibition and DNA damage were also evaluated .	
1394217_s2	The drug concentrations for 50% inhibition of cell growth in culture following 2-h and 72-h exposures were 0.073 and 0.003 microM , respectively .	
1394217_s3	After a 2-h drug exposure , the occurrence of DNA single-strand breaks ( SSBs ) was time dependent .	genomic instability and mutation
1394217_s4	It was detectable at 8 h and reached a maximum at about 24 h , 34 +/- 3 ( SD ) and 305 +/- 34 rad equivalents with 0.1 microM ( 50% inhibition concentration ) and 1.0 microM ( 90% inhibition concentration ) ICI D1694 , respectively .	
1394217_s5	A significant level of DNA SSBs ( 101 +/- 13 rad equivalents ) was still detectable at 72 h after the 2-h treatment with 1 microM ICI D1694 .	genomic instability and mutation
1394217_s6	No significant level of DNA SSBs was detected when cells were exposed simultaneously to ICI D1694 and 20 microM [ 6RS]LV .	genomic instability and mutation
1394217_s7	Complete rescue of drug-induced DNA SSBs could be achieved when cells were exposed to 10 microM dThd starting no later than 4 h after drug treatment .	genomic instability and mutation
1394217_s8	The growth inhibition of ICI D1694 was abrogated by [ 6RS]LV in a concentration-dependent manner .	
1394217_s9	Complete protection was achieved when cells were exposed simultaneously to 1 microM ICI D1694 and 5 microMs [ 6RS]LV or to 3 microMs dThd immediately after drug treatment .	
1394217_s10	The results demonstrate that : ( a ) the growth inhibition of ICI D1694 is a function of time and schedule ; ( b ) the growth inhibition is accompanied by extensive DNA single-strand breaks and slow repair ; ( c ) at 1 microM ICI D1694 , 3 microMs dThd and 5 microMs [ 6RS]LV can completely rescue cells from drug effects when dThd is added up to 4 h following drug treatment or when [ 6RS]LV is given in combination with the drug ; ( d ) interference of [ 6RS]LV with ICI D1694 action may be occurring at the level of drug uptake and at intracellular targets , while dThd interferes with the drug action at intracellular targets .	genomic instability and mutation
1399111_s0	Numerous studies have reported a correlation between production of 72-kDa ( MMP-2 ) and 92-kDa ( MMP-9 ) type-IV collagenases/gelatinases and the metastatic potential of cancer cells .	
1399111_s1	An abrogating effect of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 ) on metastases has also been noted .	
1399111_s2	In this report we have used sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassays to measure MMP-2 , MMP-9 , TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 levels in eight human lung-cancer cell lines which were characterized for biological behavior in nude mice .	
1399111_s3	We demonstrated that the Calu-6 and A549 cell lines with the highest metastatic , invasive and tumorigenic potential secreted the highest levels of MMP-2 .	activating invasion and metastasis
1399111_s4	MMP-9 and TIMP-1 secretions were comparatively low in all cell lines .	
1399111_s5	TIMP-2 secretion , which exceeded MMP-2 secretion for all cell lines , did not correlate with metastatic potential .	activating invasion and metastasis
1399111_s6	To further explore these correlations , the metastatic Calu-6 cell line was transfected with a K-rev-1 cDNA expression construct .	
1399111_s7	The K-rev revertant cell lines demonstrated a more differentiated phenotype and were less tumorigenic , invasive and metastatic in nude mice .	activating invasion and metastasis
1399111_s8	Nonetheless , the Calu-6 revertant cell lines secreted higher levels of MMP-2 than the parent cell line .	
1399111_s9	In conclusion , invasion and metastasis by lung-cancer cells requires not only enhanced MMP production , but also other less well-understood tumorigenic characteristics .	activating invasion and metastasis
1399111_s10	The multiplicity of factors required by cancer cells for dissemination helps to explain the minute fraction of cancer cells from a primary tumor that ever develop into a metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
1419600_s0	A number of growth factors have been implicated in the control of the proliferation of breast cancer cells and some have been reported to mediate the proliferative effects of oestradiol .	
1419600_s1	MCF-7 cells were treated with growth factors in the presence and absence of oestradiol .	
1419600_s2	Oestradiol increased the response of cells to the proliferative effects of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , transforming growth factor alpha ( TGF-alpha ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1419600_s3	Platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and cathepsin D had no effect in the presence or absence of oestradiol while TGF-beta slightly reduced the stimulation by oestradiol .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1419600_s4	In the absence of oestradiol , there was little effect of combinations of growth factors although the effects of bFGF and IGF-I were additive .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1419600_s5	In the presence of oestradiol , the effects of bFGF and TGF-alpha were additive whereas bFGF acted as an IGF-I antagonist .	
1419600_s6	Overall , bFGF had the greatest effect on cell proliferation although this was less marked than the previously described effect of the IGFs and insulin .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1419600_s7	The effects of oestradiol on the sensitivity of cells to the proliferative effects of bFGF did not appear to result from regulation of bFGF receptor expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1419623_s0	Previous reports showed that treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents ( NSAIA ) can alter the growth profile of a variety of tumours .	
1419623_s1	In this study , the effect of NSAIA treatment on the growth of the primary tumour and the appearance of spontaneous pulmonary metastases , was investigated .	
1419623_s2	A mammary adenocarcinoma of non-detected immunogenicity , C7HI , was grafted subcutaneously in the lateral flank of Balb/c mice .	
1419623_s3	Oral treatment with approximately 1 mg kg-1 day-1 piroxicam delayed both tumour growth and the growth of pulmonary metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
1419623_s4	Survival of mice bearing the primary tumour was significantly lengthened by anti-inflammatory treatment .	tumor promoting inflammation
1419623_s5	Similarly , in separate experiments , after surgical removal of the primary tumour by day 34 after grafting , the group of mice treated orally with piroxicam also exhibited a higher survival rate than the control group .	
1419623_s6	Upon surgical removal of the primary tumour 34 days after grafting , piroxicam treatment significantly decreased both the number and size of pulmonary metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
1419623_s7	The results of this study lends support to the hypothesis that inhibition or modulation of inflammation may delay tumour organisation and growth .	tumor promoting inflammation
1419623_s8	It is suggested that piroxicam treatment may be an appropriate adjunct therapy to delay the appearance of pulmonary metastases and to increase life-expectancy in a host whose primary tumour has to be surgically removed .	activating invasion and metastasis
1423313_s0	The effect of quercetin , a flavonoid found in many plants , on the proliferation of human leukemic T-cells was analyzed .	
1423313_s1	Quercetin reversibly blocked the cell cycle at a point 3-6 h before the start of DNA synthesis .	evading growth suppressors
1423313_s2	Expression of the growth-related genes histone H4 , cyclin A and B , and p34cdc2 was suppressed in cells blocked with quercetin .	
1423313_s3	Comparison of the quercetin arrest points with those of the cell cycle inhibitors aphidicolin and mimosine revealed a temporal order of arrest points in G1 of quercetin , mimosine , and aphidicolin .	evading growth suppressors
1423313_s4	Mimosine and aphidicolin did not inhibit the expression of cyclin A or p34cdc2 , whereas all three reagents inhibited expression of cyclin B. Low concentrations of the protein inhibitor cycloheximide inhibited release of the quercetin but not the mimosine or aphidicolin block .	
1423313_s5	A [ 35S]methionine-labeled M(r) 60,000 protein disappeared in quercetin-treated cells and was rapidly synthesized after removal of quercetin , suggesting the possibility that the M(r) 60,000 protein induces DNA synthesis after the cell is released from a quercetin block .	
1423313_s6	These results suggest the usefulness of quercetin in studies of the regulation of late G1 phase .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
1423885_s0	Previous studies have demonstrated that the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone ( NNK ) induced liver tumors in F344 rats but not in Syrian golden hamsters .	
1423885_s1	The aim of this study was to determine whether there was a correlation between the persistence of O6-methylguanine ( O6-mGua ) adducts and the rate of recovery of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( O6-mGuaT ) after depletion in the liver and susceptibility to NNK in F344 rat and Syrian golden hamster injected s.c. with NNK ( 80 mg/kg ) .	
1423885_s2	The levels of both 7-methylguanine and O6-mGua reached a maximum 24 h after NNK treatment .	genomic instability and mutation
1423885_s3	O6-mGua in NNK-treated rat liver was undetectable after 48 h .	genomic instability and mutation
1423885_s4	In the rat , the depletion of O6-mGuaT activity occurred within 4 h following NNK treatment .	genomic instability and mutation
1423885_s5	A subsequent rapid recovery of enzyme activity was observed 36 h after NNK exposure .	
1423885_s6	In contrast , high levels of O6-mGua persisted in hamster liver DNA and no O6-mGuaT activity was detected up to 336 h after NNK injection .	genomic instability and mutation
1423885_s7	Thus , the persistence of O6-mGua in hamster liver is most likely related to a lack of recovery of the O6-mGuaT .	genomic instability and mutation
1423885_s8	These results suggested that factors other than O6-mGua may be determining NNK-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats .	genomic instability and mutation
1423885_s9	An aldehyde generated by alpha-hydroxylation of NNK , 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butanal , inhibited O6-mGuaT activity in rat hepatocytes , suggesting that this aldehyde contributes to the carcinogenicity of NNK by inhibiting this repair enzyme .	genomic instability and mutation
1429875_s0	The aim of this study was to address whether there is a fundamental difference in regulation of histone gene expression in cells that have become quiescent but retain the ability to proliferate , compared with those cells that have differentiated .	
1429875_s1	We compared multiple levels of regulation of histone gene expression during 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation .	
1429875_s2	Confluent cells induced to differentiate by treatment with insulin , dexamethasone , and isobutylmethylxanthine initially exhibited an increased proliferative response compared with cells given serum alone .	
1429875_s3	This initial differentiation response was associated with a twofold increase in both histone gene transcription and cellular histone mRNA levels , as well as with enhanced sequence-specific binding of nuclear factors to the proximal cell-cycle-regulatory element of the H4 histone promoter .	
1429875_s4	Transforming growth factor beta 1 , an inhibitor of 3T3-L1 differentiation , increased both the percentage of proliferating cells and the cellular levels of histone mRNA when given in addition to serum stimulation , but no enhancement of these parameters was observed upon addition of TGF beta 1 to the differentiation treatment .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1429875_s5	Interestingly , although TGF beta 1 enhanced binding of nuclear factors to the proximal cell cycle regulatory element of the histone promoter , these protein/DNA interactions were not associated with an increase in histone transcription .	
1429875_s6	Our results are consistent with the down-regulation of histone gene expression at confluency being controlled primarily at the post-transcriptional level , in contrast to an increased involvement of transcriptional down-regulation at the onset of differentiation .	
1431095_s0	Apoptosis , programmed cell death , was previously shown to be induced by the mAb anti-APO-1 ( IgG3 , kappa ) by binding to the APO-1 cell surface Ag , a new member of the nerve growth factor/TNF receptor superfamily .	
1431095_s1	To investigate the role of the Ig H chain Fc regions we compared induction of apoptosis by the original mAb IgG3 anti-APO-1 with anti-APO-1 F(ab')2 fragments and different anti-APO-1 isotypes ( IgG1 , IgG2b , IgG2a , and IgA ) isolated by sequential sublining .	
1431095_s2	We found that IgG3 was the most active isotype ; IgG1 , IgG2a , and IgA showed intermediate activity , and IgG2b and F(ab')2 were inactive .	
1431095_s3	Cytotoxic activity of the inactive or less active antibody preparations was fully reconstituted by protein A , anti-mouse Ig , or anti-mouse Ig F(ab')2 , respectively .	
1431095_s4	Thus , APO-1-mediated induction of apoptosis was dependent on efficient cross-linking of APO-1 cell surface Ag , indirectly augmented by anti-APO-1 Fc-Fc self-aggregation .	resisting cell death
1431095_s5	Because of their different in vitro activity we selected IgG3- , IgG2b- , and IgA anti-APO-1 to test their antitumor activity against solid human B lymphoblastoid tumors in SCID mice .	
1431095_s6	The isotypes showed a different serum half-life ( IgG3 : 9.2-10.4 days , IgG2b : 1.9-2.6 days , and IgA : 14.1-29.2 h ) and a different initial tumor localization 4 h after i.p. injection ( IgG3 around the blood vessels , IgG2b homogeneously , and IgA heterogeneously distributed in the tumor ) .	
1431095_s7	All antibody preparations induced tumor regression by induction of apoptosis , even IgG2b anti-APO-1 inactive in vitro without cross-linking .	resisting cell death
1431095_s8	The activity of IgA anti-APO-1 , which did not mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity indicates that apoptosis may be used as the main if not the only mechanism of induction of tumor regression in vivo .	resisting cell death
1431095_s9	As with in vitro , IgG3 anti-APO-1 was the most effective isotype also in vivo .	
1431095_s10	This result suggests that cross-linking of APO-1 on the tumor cell surface may also be required for tumor regression by apoptosis in vivo .	resisting cell death
1431095_s11	Taken together , our data show that selective targeting of apoptosis to tumors may be an efficient antitumor mechanism .	resisting cell death
1433571_s0	At present , isoniazid ( INH ) is being used prophylactically to reduce the side effects of intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder cancer , although it is not clear whether or not this reduces the antitumor efficacy of BCG .	
1433571_s1	In this study the impact of INH treatment on the immune response after repeated intravesical BCG administration was investigated in guinea pigs .	
1433571_s2	INH was given on the 3 days around each BCG instillation .	
1433571_s3	We found that the administration of INH severely impaired the immunological effects of BCG .	avoiding immune destruction
1433571_s4	The induction of mononuclear cell infiltration in the bladder wall was reduced .	
1433571_s5	Enlargement of the regional lymph nodes ( weight and number of cells ) , and increase of MHC Class II expression on the lymph node cells , normally observed after intravesical BCG administration , were inhibited by INH .	avoiding immune destruction
1433571_s6	Systemic immunity , measured by the DTH reaction in the skin to PPD , was also diminished due to the combined treatment of BCG with INH .	avoiding immune destruction
1433571_s7	When INH was administered during the last 4 of 6 BCG instillations , the immune response to BCG was still impaired .	avoiding immune destruction
1433571_s8	A five-fold increase of the dose of BCG did not overcome the effect of INH .	avoiding immune destruction
1433571_s9	INH probably did not exert a direct suppression of the immune system of the guinea pig as the DNCB skin reactivity was not influenced .	avoiding immune destruction
1433571_s10	Although INH concentrations in the urine were high at the onset of the instillation , in vitro experiments indicated that the effect of INH may not be caused by killing of the BCG organisms shortly after application in the bladder .	
1433571_s11	In conclusion , our data in guinea pigs suggest that the use of INH may impair the immune response to intravesical BCG .	avoiding immune destruction
1433571_s12	As this response may be important for the antitumor effect of BCG , urologists should be cautious with the prophylactic use of INH .	
1433571_s13	The influence on the antitumor efficacy is now investigated in man .	
1435691_s0	Histopathological features of the lymph node involvement were studied in 104 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent subtotal esophagectomy combined with extended radical lymph adenectomy in cervicothoracoabdominal region .	
1435691_s1	Metastatic involvement was found in a total number of 503 lymph nodes from 73 patients by histologic examination .	activating invasion and metastasis
1435691_s2	The mean of long and short diameter was found to be less than 5mm in 125 ( 24.9% ) of these 503 nodes .	
1435691_s3	The involved area on the section was less than one third in 149 nodes ( 29.6% ) , and was significantly smaller in mediastinal lymph nodes than those in cervical or abdominal ones .	
1435691_s4	Sixty-seven ( 13.3% ) of 503 nodes were partially invaded by micrometastasis of 1mm or less in diameter .	activating invasion and metastasis
1435691_s5	Micrometastasis also more frequently occurred in mediastinal nodes with a statistically significant difference .	activating invasion and metastasis
1435691_s6	Extranodal proliferation ( ENP ) of cancer cells was found in 106 nodes ( 21.1% ) , and extranodal lymphatic and/or blood vessel invasion ( ENly , v ) was also recognized in 60 nodes ( 11.9% ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
1435691_s7	Micrometastasis and ENP with or without ENly , v were found in 24 ( 32.9% ) and 29 ( 39.7% ) of 73 patients with positive lymph node metastasis , respectively .	activating invasion and metastasis
1435691_s8	Postoperative survival rate in patients with micrometastasis and/or ENP with or without ENly , v was inferior to that in patients with neither of them .	
1444225_s0	The cytotoxic activity of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and the three non-immuno-suppressive CsA analogues B3-243 , WO-039 and B3-665 were studied in tumor cell lines representing both classical and atypical forms of multidrug resistance ( MDR ) : T-ALL GM3639 L100 cells selected for vincristine ( vcr ) resistance and displaying characteristics of classical MDR , including P-glycoprotein ( pgp ) expression and increased drug efflux which can be inhibited by pgp blockers ( e.g. verapamil ) , and U-1285/ADR , a small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) cell line selected for doxorubicin resistance which lacks pgp , is insensitive to pgp-blockers and shows cross resistance to cis-platinum .	
1444225_s1	At 1 micrograms/ml CsA was the most active agent in reversing Vcr resistance in L100 cells followed by B3-243 and WO-039 , with no effect of B3-665 .	
1444225_s2	Parental LO cells were only marginally sensitized to Vcr by these agents .	
1444225_s3	No reversing effect of any cyclosporin was observed in the U-1285/ADR or its parental cell line .	
1444225_s4	Compared to LO cells , L100 cells showed a marked hypersensitivity to CsA &gt ; B3-243 &gt ; WO-039 with B3-665 being inactive .	
1444225_s5	No collateral sensitivity was observed for cyclosporins in U-1285/ADR cells .	
1444225_s6	Although of different magnitude , the pattern of cytotoxic activity for the different cyclosporins alone closely parallelled that of L100 cells for U-1285 , U1285/ADR and LO cells .	
1444225_s7	The results indicate that not only the collateral sensitivity in classical MDR but also the cytotoxic actions of cyclosporins per se on tumor cells alone are independent of immunosuppressive activity .	avoiding immune destruction
1444225_s8	The results also suggest a structure-activity relationship for cyclosporin-induced cytotoxicity similar to , but independent of , MDR reversing activity .	
1445491_s0	The effect of transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( TGF-beta 1 ) and interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) on LDL receptor in Hep G2 cells was investigated .	
1445491_s1	A greater than two-fold stimulation of the binding and internalisation of [ 125I]-labelled LDL at 37 degrees C was observed after an 18-h incubation of the cells with TGF-beta 1 at 50 ng/ml and IL-1 beta at 11,700 units/ml compared with control cells .	
1445491_s2	Scatchard analysis of the binding of [ 125I]-labelled LDL at 4 degrees C after an 18-h incubation of the cells with 1170 units/ml IL-1 beta and 5 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 showed that they were both acting primarily by increasing LDL receptor number .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1445491_s3	The increase in LDL receptor activity could not be attributed to an increase in cell proliferation as TGF-beta 1 at concentrations from 0.05 ng/ml to 50 ng/ml had no significant effect on either cell number or [ 3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA whilst IL-1 beta inhibited DNA synthesis by more than 80% at a concentration of 11,700 units/ml but had significant effect on cell number .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1445491_s4	Cholesterol biosynthesis from [ 14C]acetate , in contrast to the stimulation of LDL receptor activity , was inhibited by approximately two-fold by incubation with TGF-beta 1 at 50 ng/ml and IL-1 beta at 11,700 units/ml .	
1445801_s0	Using monolayer cultures of clonally isolated C3 and T5 rat prostate cancer cells , we determined that acidic ( aFGF ) and basic ( bFGF ) fibroblast growth factors profoundly enhanced T5 cell thymidine incorporation with half-maximum stimulation at 0.53 and 0.35 ng/ml , respectively .	
1445801_s1	In contrast , aFGF or bFGF enhancement of C3 cell thymidine incorporation was about 5% of that of T5 cells , and effects were principally mitogen concentration independent .	
1445801_s2	Saturation analyses and cross-linking studies established that both C3 and T5 cells contained high-affinity FGF receptors of 120 and 145 kilodaltons and that receptor content and Kd of C3 and T5 cells were comparable. aFGF or bFGF stimulation of T5 cell thymidine incorporation profoundly decreased as cell plating density was reduced from 1.5 x 10(5) to 1.0 x 10(4) cells/well .	
1445801_s3	The modest response of C3 cells to either aFGF or bFGF also decreased as cell plating density was reduced .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1445801_s4	Because heparin preserves FGF biological activity and enhances bFGF binding to high-affinity FGF receptors , we examined the effect of heparin on FGF stimulation of C3 cell thymidine incorporation .	
1445801_s5	We found that changes in cell plating density and/or medium heparin concentration had variable , inconsistent effects .	
1445801_s6	These were C3 cell plating density associated and included inhibition or modest enhancement of FGF effects .	
1445801_s7	Binding analyses established that high-affinity bFGF binding of C3 and T5 cells immediately prior to assessing FGF-stimulated thymidine incorporation was comparable and independent of cell plating density , implying that C3 cell FGF insensitivity was not attributable to differences in C3 and T5 cell FGF receptor content at the time of mitogen stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )	
1447315_s0	MCF-7 human breast cancer cells propagated in vitro were treated with adenosine derivatives added to the culture medium .	
1447315_s1	The effects on cell proliferation , glycolysis , and glutaminolysis were investigated .	
1447315_s2	Of all adenosine derivatives tested , AMP was the most efficient inhibitor of cell proliferation .	
1447315_s3	In AMP-treated cells , DNA synthesis decreased , whereas RNA and protein syntheses rose normally with time .	
1447315_s4	In terms of carbohydrate metabolism , lactate production from glucose was drastically reduced ; therefore , most of lactate produced must have been derived from glutamine .	cellular energetics
1447315_s5	Increases in the enzyme activities involved in glutamate degradation and in the malate-aspartate shuttle were observed .	
1447315_s6	In contrast , actual glycolytic flux rates declined , whereas key glycolytic enzyme activities increased .	cellular energetics
1447315_s7	Metabolites such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and pyruvate accumulated in AMP-arrested cells .	
1447315_s8	Based on the lowered NAD level in the AMP-treated cells , lactate dehydrogenase , but not malate dehydrogenase , was impaired ; thereby the whole of glycolysis was inhibited .	cellular energetics
1447315_s9	In compensation , glutamine catabolism was increased .	
1447315_s10	NAD concentrations fell drastically because of the known inhibition of P-ribose-PP synthesis through heightened intracellular AMP levels .	
1447315_s11	A hypothetical metabolic scheme to explain these results and to show how extracellular AMP may influence carbohydrate metabolism and cell proliferation is presented .	
1447316_s0	Gamma-radiation , tetrandrine , bistratene A , and cisplatin were all found to induce pronounced morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis and extensive DNA fragmentation in the human BM13674 cell line 8 h after treatment .	resisting cell death
1447316_s1	Apoptosis induced in BM13674 cells by these diverse agents was markedly inhibited by 1 microM okadaic acid , a tumour promoter that inhibits protein phosphatases 1 and 2A .	resisting cell death
1447316_s2	This compound also inhibited the appearance of apoptosis in fresh human leukaemia cells that had been exposed to gamma-radiation .	resisting cell death
1447316_s3	The inhibition of apoptosis was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy and DNA gel electrophoresis .	resisting cell death
1447316_s4	Dephosphorylation of a limited number of proteins was shown to be associated with apoptosis and okadaic acid prevented these dephosphorylations .	resisting cell death
1447316_s5	Previous studies on the BM13674 cell line showed that an inhibitor of protein synthesis failed to prevent apoptosis in these cells .	
1447316_s6	The present data provides further support that posttranslational modification of proteins , in particular , phosphorylation/dephosphorylation status , plays an important role in inhibition/activation of programmed cell death in different human cells after exposure to several cytotoxic agents .	resisting cell death
1450637_s0	Intracellular pH ( pHi ) plays a critical role in the entry of cells into the DNA-synthesis phase of the cell cycle .	
1450637_s1	Alterations in pHi may contribute to abnormal proliferative responses such as those seen in tumorigenic cells .	
1450637_s2	We observed that alkaline stress leads to genomic transformation of Madin-Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells .	
1450637_s3	Transformed cells ( F cells ) form " foci " in culture , lack contact inhibition , and are able to migrate , typical characteristics of dedifferentiated tumorigenic cells .	evading growth suppressors
1450637_s4	F cells exhibit spontaneous biorhythmicity .	
1450637_s5	Rhythmic transmembrane Ca2+ flux activates plasma membrane K+ channels and Na+/H+ exchange .	
1450637_s6	This leads to periodic changes of membrane voltage and pHi at about one cycle per minute .	
1450637_s7	We conclude that endogenous oscillatory activity could be a trigger mechanism for DNA synthesis , proliferation , and abnormal growth of renal epithelial cells in culture .	
1451349_s0	Urokinase-type plasminogen activator ( u-PA ) plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis .	
1451349_s1	The aim of this work was to study the u-PA production , in vitro and in vivo , in a transplantable murine mammary adenocarcinoma ( M3 ) , moderately metastatic to lung , and in a related tumor variant ( MM3 ) , highly metastatic to the same organ , during tumor development .	
1451349_s2	At different times post-transplantation , tumors were employed to prepare either primary cell cultures or homogenates .	
1451349_s3	PA activity from conditioned media ( CM ) , cell lysates ( CLs ) and tumor homogenates ( THs ) was quantitated by means of a fibrinolytic assay .	
1451349_s4	Immunoneutralization and zymographic assays were performed to identify the PA present in both tumors .	
1451349_s5	PA activity in CM , CLs and THs , that was undetectable at early stages , increased significantly along the growth of M3 adenocarcinoma .	
1451349_s6	Secreted PA activity in MM3 CM was measurable at early stages and consistently increased up to 37 days post-transplantation , but a marked fall of activity was found at 48 days .	
1451349_s7	PA activity in MM3 THs exhibited the same enhancement and late fall found in vitro .	
1451349_s8	A positive correlation was observed between tumor size and THs PA values in both tumors .	
1451349_s9	The PA present in cell cultures and THs was identified as of the u-PA type .	
1451349_s10	These results support the hypothesis that high u-PA levels are important for tumor invasion and that the stage of tumor development is a critical factor in their PA activity .	activating invasion and metastasis
1457339_s0	Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) of hepatic tumours has been restricted owing to the preferential retention of photosensitizers in liver tissue .	
1457339_s1	We therefore investigated interstitial tumour illumination as a means of selective PDT .	
1457339_s2	A piece of colon carcinoma CC531 was implanted in the liver of Wag/Rij rats .	
1457339_s3	Photofrin was administered ( 5 mg kg-1 i.v. ) 2 days before laser illumination .	
1457339_s4	Tumours with a mean ( +/- s.e. ) diameter of 5.7 +/- 0.1 mm ( n = 106 , 20 days after implantation ) were illuminated with 625 nm light , at 200 mW cm-1 from a 0.5 cm cylindrical diffuser and either 100 , 200 , 400 , 800 or 1600 J cm-1 .	
1457339_s5	Control groups received either laser illumination only , Photofrin only or diffuser insertion only .	
1457339_s6	Short-term effects were studied on the second day after illumination by light microscopy and computer-assisted integration of the circumference of damaged areas .	
1457339_s7	Long-term effects were studied on day 36 .	
1457339_s8	To determine the biochemistry of liver damage and function , serum ASAT and ALAT levels were measured on day 1 and 2 , and antipyrine clearance on day 1 .	
1457339_s9	Tumour and surrounding liver necrosis increased with light dose delivered ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	resisting cell death
1457339_s10	Best long-term results were obtained at 800 J cm-1 with complete tumour remission in 4 out of 6 animals .	
1457339_s11	No deterioration in liver function was found .	
1457339_s12	The results of this study show the ability of interstitial PDT to cause major destruction of tumour tissue in the liver combined with minimal liver damage .	
1457579_s0	Fifty-six previously untreated stage-I ( according to Rai ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) patients were examined for their clinical data , immunological characteristics , and hormonal values .	
1457579_s1	Dysfunction of T and B lymphocytes was demonstrated by changed lymphocyte blastogenic response to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) , concanavalin A ( ConA ) , pisum sativatum agglutinin ( PSA ) , wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) , recombinant interleukin 2 ( IL 2 ) , and dextran sulfate ( DxS ) ; also by decreased immunoglobulin levels ( IgG , IgA , IgE ) and increased beta 2-microglobulin ( beta 2-M ) values .	avoiding immune destruction
1457579_s2	Simultaneously , dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , immune system integration , imbalance of sex hormones , and changes in thyroid hormones were observed in the same group of patients .	avoiding immune destruction
1457579_s3	Disturbed immunohormonal interactions in early-stage CLL may be responsible for the pathogenetic mechanisms in this lymphoproliferative malignancy .	avoiding immune destruction
14578017_s0	We wanted to investigate the effects of gamma radiation on DNA single-strand breaks ( SSB ) and glutathione ( GSH ) levels in mononuclear blood cells ( MNC ) of radiotherapy technicians .	
14578017_s1	DNA SSB in MNC of radiotherapy technicians who use ( 60)Co-gamma source in their works were detected by alkaline filter elution and compared to control subjects .	
14578017_s2	In addition , GSH levels were measured using the enzymatic method in MNC .	
14578017_s3	Blood samples were collected from radiotherapy technicians on Monday and Friday .	
14578017_s4	DNA SSB levels were found to be significantly higher in smoking controls compared to non-smoking controls .	genomic instability and mutation
14578017_s5	Significant increases of 36% and 49% in DNA SSB were detected from Monday to Friday for non-smoking and smoking radiotherapy technicians , respectively .	genomic instability and mutation
14578017_s6	GSH levels were found to be decreased significantly from Monday to Friday .	
14578017_s7	Gamma-radiation resulted in increased DNA SSB levels of MNC in radiotherapy technicians throughout the working week and these breaks have been observed to be repaired at the weekend .	genomic instability and mutation
14578017_s8	Smoking habit caused an additional increase in the SSBs observed in radiotherapy technicians .	genomic instability and mutation
1458471_s0	The growth-inhibitory effects of ketoconazole , an antifungal agent which inhibits arachidonic acid lipoxygenases and cytochrome P-450 enzymes , were tested in human colon and breast cancer cell lines .	
1458471_s1	In the serum independent HT29-S-B6 colon cell clone , ketoconazole reduced cell proliferation and [ 3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent fashion , with a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 2.5 microM .	
1458471_s2	Flow cytometry showed an accumulation of cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle and a concomitant decrease of the percentage of cells in S phase .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1458471_s3	Ketoconazole also inhibited [ 3H]thymidine incorporation in the hormone-independent breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and Evsa-T , with respective 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 13 and 2 microM .	
1458471_s4	The mechanism of action of ketoconazole is unknown .	
1458471_s5	However , another lipoxygenase inhibitor , BW755C , inhibited only weakly [ 3H]-thymidine incorporation and accumulated the cells in S and G2 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1458471_s6	Conversely , clotrimazole and SKF525A , inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 enzymes , had effects similar to those of ketoconazole on HT29-S-B6 cells whereas metronidazole and secnidazole , other azole derivatives which do not inhibit cytochrome P-450 enzymes , had no effect .	
1458471_s7	The results suggest that cytochrome P-450 enzyme(s) activity(ies) could be implicated in the antiproliferative effects of ketoconazole .	
1458472_s0	We found that the human colon cancer cell line SW480 consists of two distinct subpopulations which we have designated E-type ( epithelial ) and R-type ( round ) .	
1458472_s1	Pure cultures of each type were obtained by subcloning , and both have maintained their characteristic phenotypes for at least 1 year ( 40 passages ) .	
1458472_s2	E-type cells are the major ( &gt ; 98% ) type in the parental SW480 cell line .	
1458472_s3	They form flat epithelial-like colonies .	
1458472_s4	In contrast , R-type cells , which constitute a minor fraction ( &lt ; 2% ) of the parental cell line , have a rounded shape and grow in clusters of piled-up cells .	
1458472_s5	Compared to E-type cells or the parental SW480 cells , isolated R-type cells display decreased doubling time , loss of contact inhibition , less adhesiveness to culture plates , higher anchorage-independent growth in soft agar , and a much more aneuploid karyotype .	evading growth suppressors
1458472_s6	When injected s.c. into nude mice , R-type cells produce much larger tumors within the same period of time than E-type cells , and the tumors are less differentiated than those produced by the E-type cells .	
1458472_s7	Cell fusion experiments between R-type and E-type cells revealed that the R-type phenotype is dominant , and the results suggest that this is due to one or a few genetic changes .	
1458472_s8	Taken together , these findings suggest that the R-type cells represent a more malignant variant of the E-type cells .	
1458472_s9	They may be useful , therefore , for studying mechanisms involved in tumor progression .	
1458479_s0	Many reports have emphasized the role of gastrin as a growth factor for normal gastrointestinal mucosa and gastrointestinal cancers .	
1458479_s1	Recent studies have pointed out that this peptide acts also as a growth factor for the pancreatic cancer cell line AR42J .	
1458479_s2	This effect is mediated by gastrin [ cholecystokinin ( CCK)-B ] receptors .	
1458479_s3	In the present study , we investigated gastrin ( CCK-B ) receptor expression in the azaserine-induced rat pancreatic carcinoma DSL-6 , comparing it to normal rat pancreas , and we also characterized CCK receptor subtypes in this tumor .	
1458479_s4	The results showed that there is extensive gastrin binding to the DSL-6 pancreatic carcinoma .	
1458479_s5	No evidence of specific gastrin binding to normal pancreas was found .	
1458479_s6	Analysis of the ability of gastrin-17-I to inhibit 125I-gastrin-I binding demonstrated that gastrin bound to a single class of receptors with a Kd of 0.21 +/- 0.04 nM and a binding capacity of 184 +/- 29 fmol/mg protein. 125I-Gastrin-I binding was inhibited by the specific CCK-B receptor antagonist L365,260 approximately 40 times more effectively than by the specific CCK-A receptor antagonist L364,718 .	
1458479_s7	Analysis of the ability of cholecystokinin octapeptide ( CCK-8 ) to inhibit 125I-Bolton-Hunter-CCK-8 binding revealed two CCK binding sites , i.e. , a high affinity site and a low affinity site .	
1458479_s8	The observed binding affinities of CCK-8 were then introduced into the computer analysis of the dose-inhibition curve of the ability of gastrin-17-I to inhibit binding of 125I-Bolton-Hunter-CCK-8 , which was significantly better fit by a three-site model than by a two-site model .	
1458479_s9	The three sites meet the criteria for CCK-B , high affinity CCK-A , and low affinity CCK-A receptors .	
1458479_s10	The binding capacity of CCK-B receptors constitutes 34% of the total high affinity CCK binding sites .	
1458479_s11	This study demonstrated that DSL-6 pancreatic carcinoma expresses three subtypes of CCK receptors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1458479_s12	Gastrin ( CCK-B ) receptors , which were not detected in normal rat pancreas , constitute about one third of the total high affinity CCK receptors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1458479_s13	We suggest that novel expression of gastrin ( CCK-B ) receptors may be generated by gene mutation or amplification during carcinogenesis and may play an important role in promoting tumor growth .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1459995_s0	Hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , a mesenchymal-derived factor which regulates growth , motility , and morphogenesis of epithelial and endothelial cells , functions as a hepatotrophic and renotrophic factor for regeneration of the liver and kidney .	
1459995_s1	We have now obtained evidence that transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( TGF-beta 1 ) and glucocorticoids are negative regulators for HGF gene expression .	
1459995_s2	When TGF-beta 1 or dexamethasone was added to cultures of MRC-5 human embryonic lung fibroblasts and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemic cells , the amount of HGF secreted into the culture medium was inhibited to 30-40% of that of control cultures by 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 and to 40-50% by 10(-6) M dexamethasone .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1459995_s3	The inhibitory effect of TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone on HGF synthesis in MRC-5 cells was additive , thereby suggesting that TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone exert effects through distinct mechanisms .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1459995_s4	Hydrocortisone also inhibited HGF synthesis with the same potency as dexamethasone ; however , testosterone , estriol , and beta-estradiol had no effect .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1459995_s5	The rate of HGF synthesis in MRC-5 cells , as measured by pulse labeling with [ 35S]methionine and subsequent immunoprecipitation , was suppressed to 30-40% of the control with 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 , and to 30-45% by 10(-6) M dexamethasone .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1459995_s6	HGF mRNA levels in MRC-5 cells and HL-60 cells were dose-dependently suppressed by TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone ; 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 suppressed HGF mRNA levels to 32% and 35% of control culture , respectively , in MRC-5 cells and HL-60 cells , and 10(-6) M dexamethasone suppressed to 43% and 38% , respectively .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1459995_s7	Thus , TGF-beta 1 and glucocorticoids seem to inhibit HGF synthesis by suppressing the expression of the HGF gene .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1459995_s8	We propose that a negative regulation of HGF gene expression by TGF-beta 1 or glucocorticoids may be involved in physiological or pathological processes during tissue regeneration .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1460013_s0	Peptide 11 , CDPGYIGSR-NH2 , is a segment of laminin which blocks tumor cell invasion .	
1460013_s1	A high affinity laminin receptor in tumor cells is thought to be blocked by the carboxyl-terminal YIGSR , and conformational energy calculations suggest that the glycine in YIGSR allows an important conformational bend .	
1460013_s2	We replaced the YIGSR glycine residue in peptide 11 with either D-alanine or L-alanine to allow or disfavor the proposed glycine bend .	
1460013_s3	We found the Gly7--&gt;D-Ala7 analog to be equal to peptide 11 in inhibiting tumor cell invasion of basement membrane matrix .	activating invasion and metastasis
1460013_s4	The Gly7--&gt;L-Ala7 analog was much less capable of invasion inhibition .	activating invasion and metastasis
1460013_s5	Two-dimensional 1H-1H NMR was used to study the solution conformations of the peptide 11 analogs .	
1460013_s6	NOESY experiments revealed close NH-NH contacts in peptide 11 and the D-Ala7 analog , but not in the L-Ala7 analog .	
1460013_s7	Molecular dynamics generated low energy structures with excellent NOE agreement for peptide 11 and its analogs .	
1460013_s8	Both peptide 11 and the D-Ala7 analog , but not the less active L-Ala7 analog , were predicted to have similar bends around Gly7 or D-Ala7 .	
1460013_s9	These results suggest that a bend in the YIGSR region of peptide 11 may be important for the binding of laminin to its metastasis-associated receptor .	activating invasion and metastasis
1460673_s0	Many breast cancers are estrogen independent , and even in patients who initially respond to estrogen suppression therapy , the regression is often temporary .	
1460673_s1	We have recently shown that antagonists of bombesin and gastrin-releasing peptide , including RC-3095 , inhibit the growth of pancreatic , colonic , and prostatic cancers in experimental animals .	
1460673_s2	This effect was associated with a substantial decrease in epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor levels in pancreatic and colon cancers .	sustaining proliferative signaling
14607726_s0	OBJECTIVE To study the effects of angiostatin(AS) gene mediated by liposome on human pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 .	
14607726_s1	METHODS Angiostatin gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV .	
14607726_s2	The recombinant of pRC/CMV-AS was introduced into the pancreatic cancer cell line , SW1990 .	
14607726_s3	The mechanism of anti-tumor was studied and tested .	
14607726_s4	RESULTS The eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV-AS was identified by the restriction digest. pRC/CMV-AS was stably integrated into the target cells and expressed by Western blot and drug-sensitivity tests , and inhibited the vascular endothelial cells proliferation in vitro .	inducing angiogenesis
14607726_s5	In addition , the effects of the angiostatin vector on reducing the volume of tumors implanted in nude mouse models were also noted .	
14607726_s6	CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that the recombinant pRC/CMV-AS mediated by liposome may play a potential role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in the future .	
1463101_s0	Cytokines are known to play an important role in host defense by regulating the function , growth , and differentiation of the cells of the immune system .	
1463101_s1	We hypothesize that , in the tumor microenvironment , tumor cells and resident tissue cells ( e.g. , fibroblasts ) also produce cytokines that may regulate the local immune response to tumors .	
1463101_s2	Initially , homogenates of eight head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC ) were assayed for the presence of interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) to establish the presence of these cytokines in the tumors in vivo .	
1463101_s3	We detected IL-1 in all tumor homogenates and IL-4 , IL-6 , and GM-CSF in some homogenates .	avoiding immune destruction,tumor promoting inflammation
1463101_s4	To assess the ability of HNSCC to produce these cytokines , supernatants of short-term primary cultures of HNSCC were assayed for the same cytokines .	
1463101_s5	No IL-1 was detected , although baseline levels of IL-4 , IL-6 , and GM-CSF were present .	
1463101_s6	However , the stimulation of primary tumor cultures with exogenous IL-1 induced or significantly enhanced production of IL-4 ( p &lt ; 0.01 ) , IL-6 ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) , and GM-CSF ( p &lt ; 0.02 ) .	
1463101_s7	These results support our hypothesis that HNSCC secrete cytokines that may influence the response of local immune cells .	avoiding immune destruction
1463101_s8	Our data also suggest that IL-1 may have a central role in regulating the local immune response through the enhancement or induction of cytokine production by tumor and/or resident tissue cells .	avoiding immune destruction
1464626_s0	Capillary endothelial cells can be induced to form capillary-like structures in vitro by plating on fibronectin-coated dishes ( Ingber , D. E. , and Folkman , J .	
1464626_s1	( 1989 ) J. Cell Biol. 109 , 317-330 ) , thereby mimicking angiogenesis .	
1464626_s2	To assess the role of glycoproteins bearing asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in this process , we tested the effect of oligosaccharide processing inhibitors on the formation of capillary tubes .	
1464626_s3	Deoxymannojirimycin , a compound that prevents synthesis of hybrid and complex-type oligosaccharides , inhibited the formation of capillary tubes .	inducing angiogenesis
1464626_s4	In contrast , swainsonine , an inhibitor that blocks synthesis of complex- but not hybrid-type oligosaccharides , did not inhibit tube formation .	inducing angiogenesis
1464626_s5	Lectin affinity chromatography of 2-[3H] mannose-labeled glycopeptides from endothelial cells induced to form tubes did not reveal a striking difference in the spectrum of oligosaccharides compared to uninduced cells .	
1464626_s6	Since endothelial cells formed tubes normally in the presence of swainsonine , we analyzed glycopeptides from swainsonine-treated induced and uninduced cells .	
1464626_s7	Cells induced to form tubes were enriched in monosialylated hybrid-type oligosaccharides sensitive to alpha-fucosidase , beta-galactosidase , and beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase , suggestive of sialyl Lewis-X determinants .	
1464626_s8	We used an enzyme-linked immunoassay to measure sialyl Lewis-X epitopes on capillary endothelial cells and found that both induced and uninduced cells expressed sialyl Lewis-X epitopes .	
1464626_s9	Deoxymannojirimycin and , to a lesser extent , swainsonine reduced the level of sialyl Lewis-X epitopes in cells induced to form capillary tubes , but neither compound affected the level of epitopes in cell monolayers .	
1464626_s10	We conclude that synthesis of at least hybrid-type oligosaccharides is required for capillary tube formation in vitro and that an increase in monosialylated , fucosylated glycans on asparagine-linked oligosaccharides occurs during this process .	
1467515_s0	The UT-7 cell line was established from a patient with a megakaryoblastic leukemia ( Komatsu et al , Cancer Res 51 : 341 , 1991 ) .	
1467515_s1	Its proliferation is strictly dependent on the presence of hematopoietic growth factors including erythropoietin ( Epo ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , and interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) .	
1467515_s2	We investigated the differentiation capacities of this cell line under the action of several growth factors , using immunomarkers , flow cytometry , and ultrastructural techniques .	
1467515_s3	In the presence of GM-CSF and IL-3 , eosinophil and basophil promyelocytes were detected , as well as a few cells with erythroid and megakaryocytic ( MK ) differentiation features .	
1467515_s4	In contrast , Epo induced a marked erythroid differentiation with an increase of glycophorin A expression , accompanied by a few hemoglobinized cells .	
1467515_s5	Differentiation induced by the growth factors took 24 to 48 hours to begin , and increased with cell passages to a plateau at 2 weeks of culture .	
1467515_s6	However , this was not only due to a cell selection because the differential effects of Epo and GM-CSF were observed from a single cell clone and the phenotype could be reversed by opposite growth factors , even after a long period of culture .	
1467515_s7	We subsequently investigated the phenotype of UT-7 in the presence of combinations of Epo , IL-3 , and GM-CSF , and showed that GM-CSF and IL-3 act predominantly over Epo .	
1467515_s8	This effect was mediated by a rapid downmodulation of Epo receptors by GM-CSF at messenger RNA and binding sites levels , without a change in receptor affinities .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1467515_s9	On the other hand , Epo had no effect on number and affinity of GM-CSF receptors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1467515_s10	This study shows that UT-7 is a growth factor-dependent pluripotent cell line in which commitment may be directed by a hierarchical action of growth factors through an early and rapid transmodulation of growth factor receptors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1471764_s0	Chromatographic , peptide mapping and mass spectrometric analysis were used to examine hemoglobin ( Hb ) from heavy drinkers and abstainers for alcohol consumption-related modifications .	
1471764_s1	Heavy drinker and abstainer hemoglobin samples contained similar amounts of glycosylated Hb and significantly different ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) amounts of " fast " hemoglobin .	
1471764_s2	The presence of higher amounts of " fast " Hb in heavy drinker relative to abstainer samples suggested the presence of alcohol-consumption related modifications .	
1471764_s3	To further examine Hb for modifications , tryptic peptides of the " fast " hemoglobin HbA1c were isolated and analyzed by plasma desorption mass spectrometry ( PDMS). [ 14C]acetaldehyde ( AcH)-Hb was synthesized in vivo for use as a standard .	
1471764_s4	Specific peptides were chosen based on co-migration with radiolabeled peptides from a tryptic digest of the [ 14C]acetaldehyde-Hb .	
1471764_s5	The masses obtained by PDMS for two heavy drinker peptides were identical to two radiolabeled peptides ; the two pairs of peptides co-migrated on HPLC .	
1471764_s6	A comparison of the observed mass for the peptides with the theoretical masses for acetaldehyde-modified Hb peptides suggested that the peptides were AcH-modified alpha and beta chain N-termini of Hb .	
1471764_s7	The modified peptides were found in five of six heavy drinker samples .	
1471764_s8	This is the first description of site-specific AcH-Hb adducts occurring in vivo .	genomic instability and mutation
1471764_s9	The routine detection of such adducts has potential for characterizing usual alcohol intake .	genomic instability and mutation
1472035_s0	A tumor growth-dependent elevation in the hepatic levels of Zn and metallothionein ( MT ) , without a change in the level of Cu , was found in mice and rats bearing solid tumors in the inguinal region .	
1472035_s1	The levels of Zn and MT thus elevated gave a significant correlation ( r = 0.95 ) between them .	
1472035_s2	Nevertheless , when tumor-bearing mice and rats were fed a Zn-deficient diet , the hepatic levels of Zn and MT did not increase .	
1472035_s3	In mice in which inflammation was induced at the same region , on the other hand , hepatic levels of Zn and MT increased transiently after the injection of turpentine or carrageenan even when they were fed the Zn-deficient diet .	tumor promoting inflammation
1472035_s4	These results suggest that the elevation of MT and Zn levels can be a helpful marker for detecting malignancy .	
1472078_s0	The induction of apoptosis by glucocorticoids in isolated thymocytes has been studied extensively .	
1472078_s1	However , it is not known whether or not the same changes occur after in vivo glucocorticoid treatment .	
1472078_s2	In order to investigate this , we have studied the changes occurring in thymocytes isolated from rats , from 2-24 hr after a dose of dexamethasone ( 1 mg/kg ) , which caused 50% thymic atrophy .	
1472078_s3	Thymocytes were separated into four fractions by isopycnic Percoll gradients .	
1472078_s4	A loss of cells occurred within 2-8 hr , primarily in only one of the two major fractions of normal thymocytes .	
1472078_s5	This loss of normal thymocytes coincided with the appearance of small dense cells with characteristic features of apoptosis including condensed chromatin , increased DNA fragmentation , internucleosomal DNA cleavage and a " hypodiploid " peak on flow cytometric analysis .	resisting cell death
1472078_s6	Striking differences occurred in the cellular composition of the different Percoll fractions with time .	
1472078_s7	Initially ( up to 4 hr ) , the pattern of changes occurring in vivo resembled those found in vitro .	
1472078_s8	However , at later times , the complex fate of apoptotic cells in vivo , such as phagocytosis , are not observed in the in vitro studies .	resisting cell death
1473227_s0	Cell kinetics and activity of ornithine decarboxylase ( ODC ) were studied during the process of 1-hydroxyanthraquinone ( 1-HA)-induced intestinal carcinogenesis in rats .	
1473227_s1	Starting at 6 weeks of age , a total of 37 male ACI/N rats were divided into two groups and treated as follows : group I ( 18 rats ) received diet containing 1% 1-HA for 12 months ; group II ( 19 rats ) was given the basal diet alone .	
1473227_s2	Sub-groups of 5-7 rats were sequentially killed at 4 , 8 and 12 months for evaluation of the length , cell numbers and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine ( BrDU ) labeling indices of large bowel crypts together with ODC activity .	
1473227_s3	All kinetic and ODC data indicated increased DNA synthesis and proliferation at all time points .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1473227_s4	Morphological observation of the intestines also revealed melanosis , crypt abscesses and erosion , becoming more pronounced with length of exposure to the anthraquinone .	
1473227_s5	The data thus suggest that cell proliferation in the crypts of the cecum or colon is important for 1-HA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis .	
1480469_s0	The use of substrates containing well defined adducts at precise sites , is required to perform a careful analysis of the toxic and mutagenic potential of a lesion .	
1480469_s1	As a first step in this direction the octamer 5'-d(CCGGCGGT) , containing the sequence of the codons 12 d(GGC) and 13 d(GGT) of the human H-ras gene , was reacted with the antitumoral drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) .	
1480469_s2	The platinated products have been purified by HPLC .	
1480469_s3	A first set of experiments , including enzymatic digestions with nuclease P1 followed by alkaline phosphatase and acid-catalysed hydrolysis , allowed us to determine which bases were engaged in the cis-DDP lesions .	
1480469_s4	Our results indicate that only guanine residues were chelated with cisplatin to yield bifunctional adducts .	genomic instability and mutation
1480469_s5	Furthermore , by performing enzymatic digestions with phosphodiesterases , we have located the adducts with respect to the 5 ' end of the octamer .	genomic instability and mutation
1480469_s6	Among the purified and characterized platinated oligonucleotides , three present a particular interest , since we have shown here that the cis-d(GpG) adduct is precisely situated either at the d(GGC) or at the d(GGT) or at both sites of their sequence .	genomic instability and mutation
1480490_s0	We have exploited properties of photosensitizers to study an aspect of the packing of chromatin in the cell nucleus .	
1480490_s1	The fluorescent photosensitizers mesotetra(3-hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin and Photofrin II were both localized in the nuclear membrane and other membrane structures , but could not be found inside the nuclei .	
1480490_s2	Light exposure of cells at 1 degrees C in the presence of the sensitizers induced DNA double-strand breaks .	genomic instability and mutation
1480490_s3	The length distributions of DNA fragments were determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis .	
1480490_s4	Because DNA damage is produced mainly via singlet oxygen diffusing less than 0.1 microns from the sensitizer , DNA double-strand breaks were supposedly produced within this distance of the nuclear membrane .	
1480490_s5	Consistent with this , with prolonged illumination and with increasing concentrations of sensitizer the distribution of DNA fragment lengths reached a plateau level .	
1480490_s6	In contrast , with the hydrophilic , intranuclear sensitizer meso-tetra(4-sulphonatophenyl)porphyrin , no such plateau level was found .	
1480490_s7	The plateau distributions of DNA fragment lengths of different cell types had the same general shape with average fragment lengths ranging from 174 to 194 kilobasepairs .	
1480490_s8	Particular genes , c-myc , fos and p53 , were found on broad distributions of photocleaved fragment lengths .	
1480490_s9	The results indicate that on each side of the genes the locus of the chromatin fibre situated close to the nuclear membrane , varied randomly .	
1483264_s0	To assess the importance of changes in DNA methylation in an X-ray-induced cellular transformation process , methylation patterns of five nuclear protooncogenes in fifteen transformant clones were studied and compared to that of the parental non-transformed cell line m5S/1M .	
1483264_s1	All transformants examined revealed an alteration in DNA methylation in some of the genes , although these changes were variable among them .	
1483264_s2	A comparison of cellular characteristics with corresponding DNA methylation changes in different clones suggested that the loss of contact inhibition and the gain of anchorage independency were associated with increases of methylation in many genes , whereas the acquisition of tumorigenicity was often accompanied by a decrease of methylation in the N-myc and c-myc genes .	evading growth suppressors
1483264_s3	Resultant data indicate that the alteration of DNA methylation is closely related to transformation process , yet how this involvement occurs is complex and remains unclear .	
1485542_s0	We compared gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ( Gd-DTPA ) enhanced T1-weighted images ( T1-Gd ) with the histopathological findings in 13 patients with bone or soft tissue sarcomas .	
1485542_s1	Signal intensity of the viable tumor tissue was increased in T1-Gd in 92% of the patients .	
1485542_s2	The necrotic or cystic areas in the tumor were not enhanced , rendering them distinctly .	resisting cell death
1485542_s3	The degree of enhancement of the edematous area around the tumor was similar to or more marked than that of the tumor in 54% of the patients .	
1485542_s4	Area showing inflammatory cells infiltration and edematous areas in the tumor tissue were also enhanced .	tumor promoting inflammation
1485542_s5	Thus , the effect of preoperative chemotherapy in tumor tissues other than necrotic and cystic areas tended to be underestimated in T1-Gd .	
1485542_s6	Its effect should be comprehensively evaluated based on not only T1-Gd but also T2-weighted images and findings of other imaging techniques .	
1486863_s0	We have extended our studies on the relationship between cisplatin/carboplatin-induced DNA damage in readily accessible tissue(s) and clinical response to therapy .	
1486863_s1	Such an approach may assist in the study of cancer drug resistance and in establishing parameters for assessing human populations for sensitivity to DNA damaging agents in the environment .	
1486863_s2	Platinum-DNA adduct levels were measured by atomic absorbance spectrometry .	
1486863_s3	DNA repair capacity was assessed in human T-lymphocytes by the ability to repair cisplatin lesions in cellular DNA or in transfected plasmid DNA .	
1486863_s4	In a " blinded " study of 21 patients receiving combination cisplatin/carboplatin drug therapy , there was a direct relationship between DNA damage in leukocytes and disease response ( summary two-sided p = 0.00011 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
1486863_s5	The cohort of patients had 15 different tumor types , suggesting that blood tissue and tumor tissue of an individual may process platinum-DNA damage similarly regardless of the tissue of origin of the tumor .	genomic instability and mutation
1486863_s6	In leukocytes in vivo , persistence and accumulation were prominent features of the cisplatin-DNA adduct profile .	genomic instability and mutation
1486863_s7	Functional DNA repair capacity has been studied in eight human leukocyte cell lines in vitro ( three , T-cells ; three , B-cells ; one , monocytic ; one , promyelocytic ) , using a host cell reactivation assay with cisplatin-damaged pRSVcat .	
1486863_s8	In the three T cell lines studied , host cell reactivation efficiency was directly related to the cells ' abilities to repair cisplatin-damaged cellular DNA ( correlation coefficient = 0.993).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )	genomic instability and mutation
1491701_s0	PRL induces quiescent Nb2 rat T-lymphoma cells to undergo mitogenesis .	
1491701_s1	Upon PRL stimulation , the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) is induced as a novel T-cell activation gene in Nb2 cells .	
1491701_s2	Surprisingly , IRF-1 is expressed twice during a single PRL-induced growth cycle : first during the early G1 phase , in an immediate transient peak from 15 min to 2 h , and second during the G1/S phase transition , in a broader peak beginning at 8 h .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1491701_s3	The unusual biphasic expression of IRF-1 mRNA is accompanied both times by de novo IRF-1 protein synthesis .	
1491701_s4	However , the rate of IRF-1 protein turnover appears to be different in G1 and S phases .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1491701_s5	IRF-1 protein expressed in G1 exhibits a half-life of about 25 min , whereas in the S phase , the half-life is about 60 min .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1491701_s6	By washing out PRL at various times during G1 , we found a direct correlation among the length of PRL exposure , the second peak of IRF-1 mRNA expression , and DNA synthesis .	
1491701_s7	Our data suggest that PRL and one putative nuclear mediator , IRF-1 , may be important in two distinct phases of the cell cycle : first in cell cycle activation , and then in S phase progression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1494354_s0	Psoralen photoreaction with DNA produces interstrand crosslinks , which require the activity of excision and recombinational pathways for repair .	
1494354_s1	Yeast replicating plasmids , carrying the HIS3 , TRP1 , and URA3 genes , were photoreacted with psoralen in vitro and transfected into Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells .	
1494354_s2	Repair was assayed as the relative transformation efficiency .	
1494354_s3	A recombination-deficient rad52 strain was the least efficient in the repair of psoralen-damaged plasmids ; excision repair-deficient rad1 and rad3 strains had repair efficiencies intermediate between those of rad52 and RAD cells .	genomic instability and mutation
1494354_s4	The level of repair also depended on the conditions of transformant selection ; repair was more efficient in medium lacking tryptophan than in medium from which either histidine or uracil was omitted .	genomic instability and mutation
1494354_s5	The plasmid repair differential between these selective media was greatest in rad1 cells , and depended on RAD52 .	genomic instability and mutation
1494354_s6	Plasmid-chromosome recombination was stimulated by psoralen damage , and required RAD52 function .	
1494354_s7	Chromosome to plasmid gene conversion was seen most frequently at the HIS3 locus .	
1494354_s8	In RAD and rad3 cells , the majority of the conversions were associated with plasmid integration , while in rad1 cells most were non-crossover events .	
1494354_s9	Plasmid to chromosome gene conversion was observed most frequently at the TRP1 locus , and was accompanied by plasmid loss .	
14983378_s0	OBJECTIVE To investigate a potential mechanism of invasion and metastasis of oral cancers , and the possibility of the adhesion molecules being markers for evaluating the prognosis of oral cancers .	
14983378_s1	METHODS Randomly selecting achieved paraffin blocks , including 60 cases of squamous cell carcinoma(SCC) , 30 cases of verrucous carcinoma(VC) of oral mucosa and 30 cases of basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) of epidermis .	
14983378_s2	All cases were followed up .	
14983378_s3	Using immunohistochemistry method ( Envision ) to detect the expression of E-cadherin antibody and observe under light microscope .	
14983378_s4	RESULTS The studies demonstrated that 38.2% of SCC had recurrence and/or metastases after operation .	activating invasion and metastasis
14983378_s5	However , only 0.0% and 0.04% , in VC and BCC , respectively , had recurrence and/or metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
14983378_s6	There was significant difference on prognoses between SCC and VC or BCC .	
14983378_s7	The immunostaining showed significant difference of E-cad expression between SCC and VC ( P&lt;0.01 ) , SCC and BCC ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	
14983378_s8	The former was weaker than VC and BCC .	
14983378_s9	However , no difference was showed in E-cad expression between VC and BCC ( P&gt;0.05 ) .	
14983378_s10	CONCLUSION E-cad plays an important role in maintaining the phenotype of epithelial cell of SCC and normal oral mucosa .	
14983378_s11	The degree of expression of E-cad was correlated with the ability of invasion and/or metastasis of SCC , VC and BCC .	activating invasion and metastasis
14983378_s12	It indicates that E-cad may be as a helpful marker to evaluate the prognosis of oral cancers .	
15055260_s0	In our study we investigated the level of apoptosis in PBMCs and the serological level of sFas ( CD95/APO-1 ) in 22 patients with malignant melanoma ( 12 patients with unique cutaneous primary tumour and 10 patients with unique brain metastasis ) .	
15055260_s1	The first determination was performed before tumour excision and the second at 6-7 months after excision .	
15055260_s2	Results in patients with primary tumour in the first determination : 6 patients with over normal values in PBMCs apoptosis and 5 patients with increased values of sFas .	resisting cell death
15055260_s3	In the second determination : apoptosis was increased in 5 patients and sFas level was increased in 4 cases .	resisting cell death
15055260_s4	In patients with metastases in the first determination apoptosis of PBMC was increased in 7 cases and sFas in 5 cases .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
15055260_s5	In the second determination apoptosis was increased in 4 cases and sFas was increased in 4 cases .	resisting cell death
15055260_s6	Our results show that half of the investigated patients presented elevated values of PBMCs apoptosis and Fas receptor both before and 6-7 months after tumour excision .	resisting cell death
15055260_s7	Apoptosis values for PBMCs and sFas values were with 1/4 higher than normals .	resisting cell death
15055260_s8	There was no difference in clinical evolution of the patients with normal or increased values for studied parameters .	
15055260_s9	Clinical evolution was performed for 1 year .	
15055260_s10	The presence of increased values for PBMCs and sFas after tumour excision , primary or metastasis is surprising and hard to explain .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
15055260_s11	It is possible that tumoral evolution induces a disregulation at PBMCs level or other cells level that persists unexpectedly , after tumour excision or apoptotic processes , in a certain level to be independent and anterior to tumour development .	
15119525_s0	Contrary to the paradigm that cancer incidence increases indefinitely with age , significant data now suggest cancer incidence may markedly reduce beyond age 80 years for humans and beyond 800 days for mice , and is not inevitable .	
15119525_s1	We show that increasing cellular senescence with age is a possible cause of this reduction , since senescent cells are removed from the pool of cells that retain proliferative ability necessary for cancer .	enabling replicative immortality
15119525_s2	We further show that animal interventions appearing to alter senescence , p53 mutation and melatonin dosing , support the prediction that increasing senescence rate reduces cancer while reducing lifespan , and vice versa .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
15119525_s3	Studies of environmental agents associated with increased cancer might be re-examined to find if there is an association with longevity increases , which may markedly alter our view of such agents .	
15119525_s4	We also show that if an agent functions by slowing both senescence and carcinogenesis , longevity is increased while reducing cancer .	enabling replicative immortality
15119525_s5	Dietary restriction is the only known intervention that accomplishes this , but there may be others .	
1516065_s0	Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor is inversely related to expression of estrogen receptor ( ER ) and progesterone receptor in primary breast tumors and is a negative predictor for response to endocrine therapy .	
1516065_s1	To investigate a possible causal role of EGF receptor expression in breast cancer progression to hormone independence , we have created an experimental cell system .	
1516065_s2	Epidermal growth factor receptor complementary DNA was introduced in estrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells , and the resulting ZR/HERc cells exhibited a mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor , thus bypassing estrogen dependence .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1516065_s3	This EGF-induced proliferation could not be inhibited by antiestrogens .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1516065_s4	In addition , we noted changes in cell morphology and keratin expression of EGF-stimulated ZR/HERc cells , suggestive of an altered differentiation state .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1516065_s5	Furthermore , intolerance of functional ER and EGF receptor signal transduction pathways in ZR/HERc cells was observed during simultaneous activation , which possibly explains the inverse relationship of ER and EGF receptor expression in primary tumors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1516065_s6	In contrast to the parental cells , ZR/HERc cells rapidly progressed to a stable ER-negative phenotype when cultured in the presence of the antiestrogen hydroxy-tamoxifen .	
1516065_s7	These results suggest a possible role for EGF receptor in progression of breast cancer to hormone independence .	sustaining proliferative signaling
15195125_s0	In mice fed a diet supplemented with red clover isoflavones the prostatic epithelium displays a significant increase in the production of estrogen receptor beta and the adhesion protein E-cadherin but a decrease in transforming growth factor beta1 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
15195125_s1	These proteins are estrogenically-induced markers of proliferation , maintenance of histological architecture , preservation of cell phenotype and reduction of the potential for neoplastic and metastatic transformation .	
15195125_s2	This study suggests that red clover isoflavones represent a non-toxic dietary treatment for prostatic hyperplasia and a reduction in the potential for neoplastic transformation .	
15195129_s0	Limited options for the treatment of prostate cancer have spurred the search for new therapies .	
15195129_s1	One innovative approach is the use of targeted alpha therapy ( TAT ) to inhibit cancer growth , using an alpha particle emitting radioisotope such as ( 213)Bi .	
15195129_s2	Because of its short range and high linear energy transfer ( LET ) , alpha-particles may be particularly effective in the treatment of cancer , especially in inhibiting the development of metastatic tumors from micro-metastases .	
15195129_s3	Prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) is expressed in prostate cancer cells and the neovasculature of a wide variety of malignant neoplasms including lung , colon , breast and others , but not in normal vascular endothelium .	
15195129_s4	The expression is further increased in higher-grade cancers , metastatic disease and hormone-refractory prostate cancer ( PCA ) .	
15195129_s5	J591 is one of several monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) to the extracellular domain of PSMA .	
15195129_s6	Chelation of J591 mab with ( 213)Bi forms the alpha-radioimmunoconjugate ( AIC ) .	
15195129_s7	The objective of this preclinical study was to design an injectable AIC to treat human prostate tumors growing subcutaneously in mice .	
15195129_s8	The anti-proliferative effects of AIC against prostate cancer were tested in vitro using the MTS assay and in vivo with the nude mice model .	
15195129_s9	Apoptosis was documented using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [ TdT]-mediated deoxyuridinetriphosphate [ dUTP ] nick end-labeling ( TUNEL ) assay , while proliferative index was assessed using the Ki-67 marker .	
15195129_s10	We show that a very high density of PSMA is expressed in an androgen-dependent human PCA cell line ( LNCaP-LN3 ) and in tumor xenografts from nude mice .	
15195129_s11	We also demonstrate that the AIC extensively inhibits the growth of LN3 cells in vitro in a concentration-dependent fashion , causing the cells to undergo apoptosis .	resisting cell death
15195129_s12	Our in vivo studies showed that a local AIC injection of 50 microCi at 2 days post-cell inoculation gave complete inhibition of tumor growth , whereas results for a non-specific AIC were similar to those for untreated mice .	
15195129_s13	Further , after 1 and 3 weeks post-tumor appearance , a single ( 100 microCi/100 microl ) intra-lesional injection of AIC can inhibit the growth of LN3 tumor xenografts ( volume&lt;100 mm(3) ) in nude mice .	
15195129_s14	Tumors treated with AIC decreased in volume from a mean 46+/-14 mm(3) in the first week or 71+/-15 mm(3) in the third week to non-palpable , while in control mice treated with a non-specific AIC using the same dose , tumor volume increased from 42 to 590 mm(3) .	
15195129_s15	There were no observed side effects of the treatment .	
15195129_s16	Because of its in vitro cytotoxicity and these anti-proliferative properties in vivo , the ( 213)Bi-J591 conjugate has considerable potential as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer .	
1536007_s0	Although it has been demonstrated that discrete origins of DNA replication exist in eukaryotic cellular chromosomes , the detailed organization of a eukaryotic cellular origin remains to be determined .	
1536007_s1	Linker substitution mutations were constructed across the entire Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomal origin , ARS1 .	
1536007_s2	Functional studies of these mutants revealed one essential element ( A ) , which includes a match to the ARS consensus sequence , and three additional elements ( B1 , B2 , and B3 ) , which collectively are also essential for origin function .	genomic instability and mutation
1536007_s3	These four elements arranged exactly as in ARS1 , but surrounded by completely unrelated sequence , functioned as an efficient origin .	
1536007_s4	Element B3 is the binding site for the transcription factor-origin binding protein ABF1 .	
1536007_s5	Other transcription factor binding sites substitute for the B3 element and a trans-acting transcriptional activation domain is required .	
1536007_s6	The multipartite nature of a chromosomal replication origin and the role of transcriptional activators in its function present a striking similarity to the organization of eukaryotic promoters .	
1540219_s0	Glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) class Mu activity was determined in 145 unrelated hospital patients in Berlin by measuring their conjugation activity towards the specific substrate trans-stilbene oxide ( TSO ) with two substrate concentrations ( 50 and 250 microM ) in homogenates prepared from lymphocytes .	
1540219_s1	Eighty individuals ( 55.2% ) had an activity lower than 10 pmol/min/10(6) lymphocytes and were classified as GST class Mu deficient .	
1540219_s2	In 142 of 145 cases , phenotype was confirmed by the results of a genotyping procedure using the polymerase chain reaction technique .	
1540219_s3	Two fragments of 273 and about 650 bp including one and two introns , respectively , could always be amplified from genomic DNA in individuals with high GST class Mu activity and could not be amplified in persons with impaired glutathione-TSO conjugation activity .	
1540219_s4	This indicates that persons with low activity carry a large deletion mutation within the GST class Mu gene .	genomic instability and mutation
1540219_s5	The enzymatically determined antimode between low and high activity determined as 10 pmol/min/1 million lymphocytes in the assay with 50 microM TSO could be clearly confirmed by genotyping .	
1556770_s0	BACKGROUND Ovarian surface epithelial cells undergo several rounds of division to repair the wound created by follicular rupture at the time of ovulation .	
1556770_s1	This cyclical requirement for cell division , when not interrupted by the long anovulatory rest periods that occur during pregnancy and lactation , may contribute to the development of ovarian cancer .	
1556770_s2	PURPOSE AND METHODS To test this hypothesis , we isolated rat ovarian surface epithelial cells from 10 adult female Fisher rats , initiated two mixed-population and seven clonal cell lines , and repeatedly subcultured these cells in vitro for more than 20 passages .	
1556770_s3	We then tested them for the acquisition of the following four features associated with transformation : 1 ) the loss of contact inhibition , 2 ) the capacity for substrate-independent growth , 3 ) the ability to form tumors when injected subcutaneously and/or intraperitoneally into athymic mice , and 4 ) cytogenetic abnormalities .	
1556770_s4	RESULTS Loss of contact inhibition was observed in all nine late-passage cell lines .	evading growth suppressors
1556770_s5	Six of the nine late-passage , but none of the early-passage , cell lines tested exhibited a capacity for substrate-independent growth that was augmented in a dose-dependent manner by epidermal growth factor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1556770_s6	Two late-passage cell lines ( clone 2 and mixed-population 2 ) generated tumors in athymic BALB/c mice within 3 weeks following subcutaneous injection of 5 x 10(6) cells , whereas similar numbers of early-passage cells from the same cell lines failed to generate palpable tumors .	
1556770_s7	Late-passage clone 7 cells were tumorigenic when 5 x 10(7) cells were injected intraperitoneally .	
1556770_s8	Two of the cell lines analyzed exhibited alterations involving losses of part or all of one member of the chromosome 5 pair .	
1556770_s9	Clone 2 possessed an interstitial deletion , del(5)(q21.3q24) , consistent with the loss of an uncloned putative tumor suppressor gene at 5q22q23 previously reported to reside near the loci for the interferon alpha , interferon beta , and c-jun genes .	
1556770_s10	Early-passage clone 7 cells exhibited chromosome 5 monosomy , while late-passage cells contained one normal chromosome 5 and a derivative ( 5q12q ) .	
1556770_s11	Southern analysis of the three cell lines revealed no consistent loss of loci for the interferon and c-jun genes , although early-passage clone 7 cells had one half the gene copy number for the interferon beta and c-jun genes and both early- and late-passage clone 7 cells lacked DNA sequences hybridizing with the probe for interferon alpha .	
1556770_s12	CONCLUSION This pattern of passage-dependent spontaneous transformation of rat ovarian surface epithelial cells in vitro supports the hypothesis that repetitious ovulation contributes to the etiology of human ovarian cancer .	
1559229_s0	The hypothesis that rodent cells can be immortalized by the direct induction of a single mutation-like event was tested by initiating cultures of benzo(a)pyrene treated Syrian hamster embryo cells with low inocula and expanding these few cells maximally until senescence prevented further culturing or immortalization took place .	
1559229_s1	According to the mutation hypothesis immortalization is hardly to be expected under these conditions .	
1559229_s2	However , immortalization was frequently observed .	enabling replicative immortality
1559229_s3	Therefore the induction of immortalization appears indirect .	enabling replicative immortality
1559229_s4	The progeny of benzo(a)pyrene treated cells immortalized with a rate of 3.9 x 10(-8)/cell/generation , which is 64 times higher than the spontaneous rate .	enabling replicative immortality
1559229_s5	The results are in line with the probabilistic theory developed in 1980 by both Fernandez et al .

1572394_s0	The protein toxins ricin , abrin , Shiga toxin , and diphtheria toxin were found to induce lysis of several cell lines in a manner characteristic for programmed cell death or apoptosis .	
1572394_s1	The toxins induced DNA degradation , and light and electron microscopical studies revealed that lysis was preceded by reorganization of intracellular vacuoles , cell blebbing , and chromatin condensation both in Vero and in MDCK cells .	
1572394_s2	Cell lysis was efficiently inhibited by cycloheximide and 3-methyladenine ( 3MA ) , a specific inhibitor of autophagy .	resisting cell death
1572394_s3	Cycloheximide , which like 3MA inhibits autophagy , protected even when added at a time when the protein synthesis had been blocked by ricin , suggesting that the effect of cycloheximide on cell lysis is independent of its ability to inhibit protein synthesis .	resisting cell death
1572394_s4	Also theophylline and dibutyryl-cGMP had some protective effect , whereas a number of compounds reported to protect against apoptosis in other systems were without protective effects .	resisting cell death
1572394_s5	The data suggest that autophagy is important for the toxin-induced cell lysis .	resisting cell death
1577279_s0	Clones of mortal chicken fibroblasts and erythroblasts transformed by temperature-sensitive v-src and v-erb B oncoproteins have been developed into immortal cell lines that retain the conditional transformed phenotype .	
1577279_s1	The expressions of two tumor suppressor genes , the retinoblastoma ( Rb ) gene and the p53 gene , were investigated during senescence , crisis , and cell line establishment .	
1577279_s2	In temperature-sensitive ( ts)-v-erb B erythroblasts and ts-v-src fibroblasts ( as well as in v-myc macrophages ) , loss of p53 mRNA or expression of a mutated p53 gene invariably occurred in the early phase of immortalization .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
1577279_s3	In contrast , expression of the Rb gene was unchanged at all stages of immortalization .	enabling replicative immortality
1577279_s4	Inactivation of the original temperature-sensitive oncogene led to loss of the transformed phenotype in fibroblasts and to differentiation in erythroblasts , even in lines that were immortal and lacked p53 .	
1577279_s5	The results demonstrate that the process of immortalization is distinct from cell transformation , probably requiring different mutational events .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
1596891_s0	Findings of increased numbers of epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGF-R ) and increased expression of transforming growth factor alpha ( TGF-alpha ) in surgical specimens of human renal cell carcinoma have led to the proposal that growth of these tumors may be regulated by TGF-alpha in an autocrine manner .	
1596891_s1	In the studies presented here , we have examined this hypothesis using two human renal carcinoma cell lines , SKRC-4 and SKRC-29 .	
1596891_s2	We demonstrated that both SKRC-4 and SKRC-29 cells were growth stimulated by greater than 35% when cultured in the presence of TGF-alpha or EGF and were inhibited by 29% to 46% if cultured in the presence of anti-EGF-R monoclonal antibody 225 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1596891_s3	Treatment of cells with TGF-alpha enhanced the levels of expression of EGF-R mRNA and TGF-alpha mRNA .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1596891_s4	In addition , incubation of cells with monoclonal antibody 225 significantly elevated the levels of excreted TGF-alpha species in the culture medium .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1596891_s5	Our findings suggest that proliferation of human renal carcinoma cells may be regulated by endogenously produced TGF-alpha and that this regulatory pathway can be interrupted using antibody to its receptor , EGF-R .	sustaining proliferative signaling
16078444_s0	The immune system has an important role in tumor appearance and spreading .	
16078444_s1	One of the most efficient subpopulations of cytotoxic cells in the destruction of tumors are NK cells .	
16078444_s2	NK cells are activated and increase their cytotoxic potential and modulate their cytokine production after treatment with IFNgamma , IL-12 , TNFalpha and IL-2 .	
16078444_s3	The investigation of the activity of NK cells was performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) of 16 healthy controls and of 40 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma .	
16078444_s4	Modulation of NK cells was performed with IL-2 , IL-7 , IL-12 , TNFalpha , monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) for TNFalpha and TNFalpha receptors type I and II , as well as with sera of healthy controls and patients with breast cancer in different clinical stages .	
16078444_s5	Modulating effect of the applied factors after in vitro treatment of PBL was evaluated by the cytotoxic assay using 51chromium .	
16078444_s6	Our results indicate that IL-2 significantly increased the activity of NK cells of controls and breast cancer patients .	avoiding immune destruction
16078444_s7	The sera of patients with advanced breast cancer significantly reduced NK cell activity .	
16078444_s8	IL-7 , IL-12 and mAb for TNFalpha do not significantly change the activity of NK cells .	
16078444_s9	The presence of anti-TNFalpha mAb did not change the inhibitory effect of the sera of breast cancer patients with advanced disease on the activity of NK cells of controls and patients with breast cancer .	
16078444_s10	Blocking of TNFalpha Rcs with mAbs decrease the reactivity of NK cells for IL-2 .	
16078444_s11	The treatment of breast cancer patients with advanced clinical stage of breast cancer with IL-2 , as an additional therapy , could be advantageous , as NK cells after this treatment increase their cytotoxic activity against tumor cells and can improve therapeutical results .	
1612500_s0	Considerable debate centers on the optimal treatment for vulvar melanoma , as well as those clinicopathological factors influencing prognosis .	
1612500_s1	We reviewed 80 patients with vulvar melanoma seen between 1949 and 1990 .	
1612500_s2	Primary tumors were assessed according to Chung ( 47 patients ) and Breslow ( 65 patients ) microstaging systems .	
1612500_s3	Fifty-nine patients ( 76% ) underwent radical vulvectomy , ten patients ( 13% ) had a partial vulvectomy , and nine patients ( 12% ) had a wide local excision .	
1612500_s4	Fifty-six also underwent inguinal node dissection .	
1612500_s5	Median follow-up was 193 months .	
1612500_s6	Median survival was 63 months .	
1612500_s7	Ten-year survival by Chung level was as follows : I 100% ; II , 81% ; III , 87% ; IV , 11% ; V , 33% .	
1612500_s8	Ten-year survival by tumor thickness was as follows : 0.75 mm , 48% ; 0.75-1.5 mm , 68% ; 1.51-3.0 mm , 44% ; greater than 3.0 mm , 22% .	
1612500_s9	Increased depth of invasion was associated with increased incidence of inguinal node metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
1612500_s10	Cox regression analysis demonstrated prognostic significance for tumor thickness ( P less than 0.001 ) , inguinal node metastasis ( P less than 0.001 ) , and older age at diagnosis ( P less than 0.001 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
1612500_s11	Radical vulvectomy did not seem to improve survival over less radical procedures .	
1612500_s12	Based on this experience , we recommend radical local excision for patients with malignant melanoma of the vulva .	
1612500_s13	Patients who have more than a superficially invasive melanoma should also have inguinal lymph node dissection .	
1614357_s0	Many human cellular and tissue compartments are supersaturated with respect to calcium oxyanion salts .	
1614357_s1	In order to prevent the formation of injurious crystals efficient anti-crystallization protective mechanisms must be necessary .	
1614357_s2	We suggest that depletion of such systems , particularly in ageing organisms and under conditions of oxidative stress , plays an important role in degenerative and inflammatory diseases , including cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
1617649_s0	Tricyclic antidepressants , such as amitriptyline ( Elavil ) , and the nontricyclic agent , fluoxetine ( Prozac ) , bind to growth-regulatory intracellular histamine receptors , associated with anti-estrogen binding sites in microsomes and nuclei .	
1617649_s1	The prototype anti-estrogen binding site/intracellular histamine receptor ligand , N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine HCl , inhibits normal cell proliferation in vitro but stimulates tumor growth in vivo .	
1617649_s2	Because of their structural similarity to N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(phenylmethyl)phenoxy]ethanamine HCl , we carried out studies to determine whether amitriptyline and fluoxetine stimulate tumor growth and/or development in rodents at concentrations relevant to the treatment of human depression ( equivalent human dose range , approximately 100-150 mg/day for amitriptyline and approximately 20-80 mg/day for fluoxetine ) .	
1617649_s3	All experiments were performed blinded .	
1617649_s4	In studies of growth stimulation of transplantable syngeneic tumors , groups of mice were inoculated s.c. with C-3 fibrosarcoma cells or given i.v. or s.c. injections of B16f10 melanoma cells , followed 24 h later by daily i.p. injections of saline , amitriptyline , or fluoxetine .	
1617649_s5	Tumor latency ( fibrosarcoma ) , aggregate tumor weight ( s.c. injected melanoma ) , or time to death from pulmonary metastasis ( i.v. injected melanoma ) was determined ; drug-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis in C-3 fibrosarcoma cells in vitro was correlated with tumor growth acceleration in vivo .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1617649_s6	In a mammary carcinogenesis model , the effects of chronic saline , amitriptyline , or fluoxetine administration on the rate and frequency of development of mammary tumors in rats fed dimethylbenzanthracene ( DMBA ) were compared .	
1617649_s7	Eight of 20 amitriptyline- or fluoxetine-treated mice developed fibrosarcoma tumors by day 5 , as compared to none of 20 saline controls ( P less than 0.002 ) .	
1617649_s8	Similarly , 20 of 21 DMBA-treated rats receiving the antidepressant drugs developed 33 mammary tumors by week 15 as compared to 5 tumors in 4 of 7 DMBA-treated rats receiving saline ( P less than 0.001 ) .	
1617649_s9	For both models , tumor latency decreased 30-40% and , in the DMBA model , tumor frequency increased greater than 2-fold in the antidepressant-treated rats as compared to controls .	
1617649_s10	Stimulation of fibrosarcoma growth in vivo correlated with a corresponding bell-shaped drug-induced increase in DNA synthesis in vitro .	
1617649_s11	While the median time to death from pulmonary metastases did not differ among groups given i.v. injections of melanoma cells , a significant ( P less than 0.01 ) stimulation of growth of s.c. injected melanoma was observed in mice receiving the antidepressants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS )	activating invasion and metastasis
1622628_s0	Twelve postmenopausal women ( 54-93 years ) with primary breast carcinoma were treated with tamoxifen due to infirmity or refusal to undergo surgery .	
1622628_s1	Seven premenopausal patients ( 32-50 years ) were given preoperative chemotherapy because of large tumors or inflammatory carcinoma .	
1622628_s2	Fine-needle aspiration biopsy was used to procure tumor cells for diagnosis , hormone receptor determination and analysis of proliferation fraction .	
1622628_s3	Aspirations were repeated every 3 months in the tamoxifen group and each month in patients receiving chemotherapy .	
1622628_s4	Two patients who responded to tamoxifen had tumors with more than 75% estrogen receptor positive cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1622628_s5	A decreased proliferation fraction was observed in two tumors responding to tamoxifen .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1622628_s6	Eight patients , all with estrogen receptor positive tumors , had stable disease .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1622628_s7	Progressive disease was observed in two patients with less than 25% receptor positive cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1622628_s8	In these tumors the percentage of proliferating cells remained high during therapy .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1622628_s9	Objective response was recorded for six patients treated with chemotherapy .	
1622628_s10	The clinical response was reflected in a decreased proliferation fraction .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1622628_s11	No correlation was observed between response and percentage of proliferating cells in the untreated tumor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1622628_s12	The results suggest that analysis of tumor cell characteristics such as hormone receptor content and proliferation fraction can be used to predict and monitor response to endocrine treatment and chemotherapy in breast carcinomas .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1639009_s0	Because PRL has growth factor activities in several tissues , we have asked whether it also has autocrine growth factor activity in pituitary GH3 cells .	
1639009_s1	GH3 cells were grown at increasing densities in the presence or absence of antirat PRL ( polyclonal and monoclonal ) or nonspecific antibodies .	
1639009_s2	Cell proliferation increased with increasing cell density , as did the concentration of PRL in the medium .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1639009_s3	Antirat PRL , but not control antibody , markedly inhibited but did not eliminate cell proliferation , and this effect was diminished with increasing PRL concentration in the medium .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1639009_s4	PRL receptors were demonstrated on 40-50% of the cells by indirect immunofluorescence using a specific antirat PRL receptor monoclonal antibody .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1639009_s5	Cell surface PRL was colocalized to the same 40-50% of the cells and copatched or cocapped along with the receptors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1639009_s6	Absence or presence of PRL receptors did not correlate with stage of the cell cycle , as judged by ethidium bromide dual labeling .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1639009_s7	Cell surface PRL was found to be on PRL-containing cells .	
1639009_s8	These data have fulfilled four criteria necessary for establishment of a substance as a secreted autocrine growth factor : 1 ) the factor must be secreted ; 2 ) in log growth phase , increased cell proliferation should occur at increased cell densities ; 3 ) the cells must display a receptor for the factor ; and 4 ) there must be a growth response to the factor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1639009_s9	Thus we have established that PRL is an autocrine growth factor for at least 40-50% of the GH3 cell population .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1639009_s10	This , to our knowledge , is the first example of autocrine growth factor activity of a major hormone normotopically expressed .	sustaining proliferative signaling
17298156_s0	The study focuses on the effects of combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) on the onset of cervical dysplasia among Zimbabwean women .	
17298156_s1	Women who had used COCs for at least 2 years and were in continued use were compared to non-users of COCs ( control group ) .	
17298156_s2	It was difficult to establish the average period of contraceptive use because in most instances there was no proper documentation on the exact dates as to when the subjects started using COCs .	
17298156_s3	The number of subjects with each condition was noted from each of the following age groups ; &lt;20 years , 20-29years , 30-39years , 40-49years and &gt;50years .	
17298156_s4	It was found that the percentage of the control group with benign conditions was higher than that of COC users in all age groups .	
17298156_s5	Significant differences at 95 percent confidence level were noted for the 20-29 years age group ( z= -2.21 ) and 40-49 years age group ( z= -2.53).The number of subjects in the &lt;20 years and &gt;50 years age groups were too small for z-score computation .	
17298156_s6	No significant differences were noted for mild to moderate cervical inflammation in all age groups .	tumor promoting inflammation
17298156_s7	There was a higher percentage of COC users with severe cervical inflammation compared to the control group in all age groups .	tumor promoting inflammation
17298156_s8	Significant differences were noted in the 30-39 years age group ( z=3.45 ) and 40-49 years age group ( z= 1.98 ) .	
17298156_s9	A higher percentage of CIN I was noted among pooled COC users compared to the control group ( z= 2.00 ) although no significant differences were obtained within different age groups .	
17298156_s10	In conclusion , severe cervical inflammation and CIN I are more frequent among Zimbabwean women who use COCs as compared to non-users of COCs .	tumor promoting inflammation
17298156_s11	Frequencies of advanced CIN are low among women who undergo routine cytological screening because this enables early detection and subsequent treatment .	
1741385_s0	We have constructed plasmids pS3G-1 and pSG4 that contain single acetylaminofluorene adducts within contiguous runs of three ( 5'-CCCG1G2G3-3' ) and four ( 5'-CG1GGG4T-3' ) guanine residues , respectively .	
1741385_s1	In Escherichia coli , the frequency of induced -1 frameshift mutations was strongly dependent on the position of modification : pS3G-G3 was approximately 100-fold and 10-fold more mutagenic than pS3G-G1 and pS3G-G2 , respectively ; pSG4-G4 was approximately 600-fold more mutagenic than pSG4-G1 .	genomic instability and mutation
1741385_s2	Mutagenesis was SOS-dependent and was markedly reduced in bacteria that were proficient in nucleotide excision repair as compared to a repair-deficient uvrA6 mutant .	genomic instability and mutation
1741385_s3	DNA sequencing showed that -1 frameshift events in pS3G-1 consisted of either targeted mutations ( greater than 90% of induced mutations ) within the guanine sequence or semitargeted mutations ( greater than 10% ) in the 5 ' flanking repetitive cytosine sequence .	genomic instability and mutation
1741385_s4	Semitargeted events , which were observed when acetylaminofluorene modification was at G1 and G2 , show that a lesion can reduce the fidelity of replication at positions 5 ' to its location on the template strand .	
1741385_s5	No semitargeted frameshifts were observed in plasmid pSG4 , which lacks a repetitive sequence 5 ' to the adduct .	genomic instability and mutation
1741385_s6	Our results are consistent with a model for frameshift mutagenesis in which the acetylaminofluorene adduct ( i ) allows accurate incorporation of cytosine opposite the bulky lesion during DNA synthesis and ( ii ) impedes elongation of primer/template termini formed opposite the adduct or 5 ' to the adduct on the template strand , providing increased opportunity for the formation of slipped frameshift intermediates .	genomic instability and mutation
17585441_s0	Novel photosensitizers Hypocrellin A ( HA ) and Hypocrellin B ( HB ) , lipid soluble perylquinone derivatives of the genus Hypericum have a strong photodynamic effect on tumors and viruses .	
17585441_s1	However , the mechanisms of tumor cell death induced by HA and HB are still unclear .	
17585441_s2	In this study , we attempt to elucidate the photodynamic effects of HA and HB compounds in poorly differentiated ( CNE2 ) and moderately differentiated ( TW0-1 ) human nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) cells as well as human mucosal colon ( CCL-220.1 ) and bladder ( SD ) cells .	
17585441_s3	Using these cell lines we investigated few hall marks of apoptotic commitments in a drug and light dose dependent manner .	
17585441_s4	Tumor cells photoactivated with HA and HB showed cell size shrinkage and an increase in the sub-diploid DNA content .	
17585441_s5	A loss of membrane phospholipid asymmetry associated with apoptosis was induced by all tumor cell lines as evidenced by the externalization of phosphatidylserine .	resisting cell death
17585441_s6	Western blot analysis of poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase , a caspases substrate , showed the classical cleavage pattern ( 116 to 85kDa ) associated with apoptosis in HA and HB-treated cell lysates .	resisting cell death
17585441_s7	In addition , PARP cleavage was blocked by using tetrapepdide caspases inhibitors such as DEVD or z-VAD .	
17585441_s8	These results demonstrate that tumor cell death induced by HB and HA is mediated by caspase proteases .	resisting cell death
17585441_s9	This study also identifies both colon and bladder cells were more sensitive cell lines than NPC ( CNE2 and TWO-1 ) cell lines .	
17590955_s0	We have investigated the cytotoxic activity , the induction of apoptosis , and the interstrand cross-linking efficiency in the A2780cisR ovarian tumor cell line , after replacement of the two NH3 nonleaving groups in trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2] ( trans-DDP ) by dimethylamine and isopropylamine .	
17590955_s1	The data show that trans-[PtCl2(NH(CH)2)(NHCH(CH3)2)] is able to circumvent resistance to cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2] ( cis-DDP , cisplatin ) in A2780cisR cells .	
17590955_s2	In fact , trans-[PtCl2(NH(CH3)2)(NHCH(CH3)2)] shows a cytotoxic potency higher than that of cis-DDP and trans-DDP , with the mean IC50 values being 11 , 58 , and 300 microM , respectively .	
17590955_s3	In addition , at equitoxic doses ( concentrations of the platinum drugs equal to their IC50 values ) and after 24 hours of drug treatment , the level of induction of apoptosis by trans-[PtCl2(NH(CH3)2)(NHCH(CH3)2)] is twice that produced by cis-DDP .	resisting cell death
17590955_s4	Under the same experimental conditions , trans-DDP does not induce significant levels of apoptosis in A2780cisR cells .	resisting cell death
17590955_s5	After 24 hours of incubation of A2780cisR cells at concentrations equal to the IC0o value of the platinum drugs , the level of DNA interstrand cross-links ( ICLs ) induced by trans-[PtCI2(NH(CH)2)(NHCH(CH3)] is two and three times higher , respectively , than those induced by cis-DDP and trans-DDP .	genomic instability and mutation
17590955_s6	We also found that trans-[PtCl2(NH(CH3)2)(NHCH(CH3)2)] formed DNA ICLs between guanine and complementary cytosine .	genomic instability and mutation
17590955_s7	We propose that , in A2780cisR cells , the induction of apoptosis by trans-[PtCl2(NH(CH3)2)(NHCH(CH3)2)] is related to its greater ability ( relative to cis-DDP and trans-DDP ) to form DNA ICLs .	resisting cell death
18763061_s0	The morphology characteristics of cell apoptosis of the malignant tumour cells in magnetic field-treated mouse was observed for the first time .	resisting cell death
18763061_s1	The apoptotic cancer cell contracted , became rounder and divorced from adjacent cells ; the heterochromatin condensed and coagulated together along the inner side of the nuclear membrane ; the endoplasmic reticulums ( ER ) expanded and fused with the cellular membrane ; many apoptotic bodies which were packed by the cellular membrane appeared and were devoured by some lymphocytes and plasma .	resisting cell death
18763061_s2	Apoptosis of cancer cells was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediatedin situ nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) .	resisting cell death
18763061_s3	It was found that the number of apoptosis cancer cells of the sample treated by the magnetic field is more than that of the control sample .	resisting cell death
18763061_s4	The growth of malignant tumour in mice was inhibited and the ability of immune cell to dissolve cancer cells was improved by ultralow frequency ( ULF ) pulsed gradient magnetic field ; the nuclei DNA contents decreased , indicating that magnetic field can block DNA replication and inhibit mitosis of cancer cells .	
18763061_s5	It was suggested that magnetic field could inhibit the metabolism of cancer cell , lower its malignancy , and restrain its rapid and heteromorphic growth .	
18763061_s6	Since ULF pulsed gradient magnetic field can induce apoptosis of cancer cells and inhibit the growth of malignant tumour , it could be used as a new method to treat cancer .	resisting cell death
18944142_s0	ABSTRACT Partial DNA fragments of Botrytis cinerea field isolates encoding the putative osmosensor histidine kinase gene ( BcOS1 ) were cloned by polymerase chain reaction amplification and the predicted amino acid sequences were compared between dicarboximide-sensitive and resistant field isolates .	
18944142_s1	The predicted BcOS1p is highly homologous to osmosensor histidine kinase OS1p from Neurospora crassa including the N-terminal six tandem repeats of approximately 90 amino acids .	
18944142_s2	Four dicarboximide-resistant isolates of B. cinerea ( Bc-19 , Bc-45 , Bc-682 , and Bc-RKR ) contained a single base pair mutation in their BcOS1 gene that resulted in an amino acid substitution in the predicted protein .	genomic instability and mutation
18944142_s3	In these resistant isolates , codon 86 of the second repeat , which encodes an isoleucine residue in sensitive strains , was converted to a codon for serine .	
18944142_s4	The mutation of Botrytis field resistant isolates was located on the second unit of tandem amino acid repeats of BcOS1p , whereas the point mutations of the fifth repeat of OS1p confer resistance to both dicarboximides and phenylpyrroles and also osmotic sensitivity in Neurospora crassa .	genomic instability and mutation
18944142_s5	These results suggest that an amino acid substitution within the second repeat of BcOS1p is responsible for phenotypes of field resistant isolates ( resistant to dicarboximides but sensitive to phenylpyrroles , and normal osmotic sensitivity ) in B. cinerea .	
19003113_s0	An aqueous extract of Kefir , fermented milk originally produced in the Caucasus mountains , suppressed morphological changes of human melanoma HMV-1 and SK-MEL cells and human normal fibroblastTIG-1 cells caused by UVC-irradiation , suggesting that UV damage can be suppressed by the Kefir extract .	
19003113_s1	The addition of the Kefir extract after UVC-irradiation of HVM-1 cells resulted in a remarkable decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) which had been increased by UVC irradiation .	tumor promoting inflammation
19003113_s2	The Kefir extract also stimulated unscheduled DNA synthesis and suppressed UVC-induced apoptosis of HMV-1 cells .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
19003113_s3	A colony formation assay revealed that the Kefir extract rescued HMV-1 cells from cell death caused by UVC irradiation .	
19003113_s4	The Kefir extract , as well as methyl methanethiosulfonate which is known to enhance the nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) activity , exhibited strong thymine dimer repair-enhancing activity .	genomic instability and mutation
19003113_s5	Epigalocatechin exhibited a weak NER activity but vitamins A , C , and E and catechin showed no NER activity .	genomic instability and mutation
19003113_s6	The thymine dimer repair-enhancing factors in the Kefir extract were heat-stable and assumed to be molecules with a molecular weight of less than 5000 .	
19003113_s7	The treatment of HMV-1 cells with the Kefir extract during or before UVC- irradiation also prevented the generation of ROS and thymine dimmer , and suppressed the apoptosis of HMV-1 cells , suggesting that application of Kefir can prevent UV damage .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
19003298_s0	Biomaterials such as polyetherurethans ( PEUs ) are the scaffolding , which is indispensable for the development of the bio-artificial organs .	
19003298_s1	However , PEUs can induce tumors in subcutaneous implantation sites in rat .	
19003298_s2	We have shown that the different inhibitory potential of gap junctional intercellular communication ( GJIC ) on the surface of the biomaterials , including PEUs , is a key step in determining the tumorigenic potential .	
19003298_s3	Here we show that suppression of a gap junctional protein connexin 43 ( Cx43 ) plays an important role in in vivo tumorigenesis induced by PEUs for the first time and that Cx43 transfection may be an effective strategy for preventing tumorigenesis induced by biomaterials .	
19003298_s4	Rat tumor cell line U41 is derived from tumors in the subcutaneous implantation of PEU films .	
19003298_s5	The GJIC and the expression of Cx43 were suppressed in U41 .	
19003298_s6	The restoration of normal phenotype , such as reduction of growth rate , recovery of contact inhibition and loss of colony formation ability in soft agar , was achieved by Cx43 transfection .	evading growth suppressors
19003298_s7	These results strongly suggest that suppression of Cx43 expression plays an important role in the development of rat malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( MFHC ) caused by PEUs and that Cx43 transfection is effective for prevention of tumorigenesis induced by PEUs .	
19308738_s0	The involvement of iron and inflammation parameters on overall survival in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients was studied .	
19308738_s1	Furthermore , transferrin receptors 1 ( TfR1 ) and ferritin expression in tumor tissue , tumor stroma , and normal lung tissue were analyzed .	
19308738_s2	Iron metabolism and inflammation parameters were determined by automated laboratory measurements at the time of diagnosis .	
19308738_s3	TfR1 and ferritin expression were determined by immuno-histochemical methods .	
19308738_s4	About 50% of patients survived 12 months only .	
19308738_s5	At the time of diagnosis more than half of the patients had anemia and significantly elevated serum ferritin .	
19308738_s6	Iron content of serum ferritin ( ICF ) was below the reference values in 90% of patients .	
19308738_s7	Furthermore , ICF showed positive correlation with iron metabolic parameters and survival but negative correlation with serum ferritin and ESR .	
19308738_s8	The expression of TfR1 and ferritin in tumor cells was observed in 88% or 62% of patients , respectively .	
19308738_s9	Tumor stroma was TfR1 negative and sporadically ferritin positive .	
19308738_s10	Tumor tissue ferritin expression showed negative correlation with serum iron and hematokrit ( Ht ) , and positive correlation with ferritin , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , alpha-1 globulin , and alpha-2 globulin .	
19308738_s11	Positive correlation was found between TfR1 expression in tumor tissue and alpha-globulin .	
19308738_s12	The correlation between TfR1/ferritin expression in tumor tissue and ICF or survival was not observed .	
19308738_s13	Therefore , we conclude that elevated serum ferritin in sera of NSCLC patients is the result of inflammation and oxidative stress rather than body iron overload .	tumor promoting inflammation
19308738_s14	Higher expression of ferritin in tumor tissue may be the consequence of iron deficiency or local toxicity induced by environmental factors .	
19590824_s0	Ferric nitrilotriacetate ( Fe-NTA ) is a potent nephrotoxicant and a renal carcinogen that induces its effect by causing oxidative stress .	
19590824_s1	The present study was undertaken to explore protective effect of silymarin , a flavonolignan from milk thistle ( Silybum marianum ) , against Fe-NTA mediated renal oxidative stress , inflammation and tumor promotion response along with elucidation of the implicated mechanism(s) .	
19590824_s2	Administration of Fe-NTA ( 10 mg/kg bd wt , i.p. ) to Swiss albino mice induced marked oxidative stress in kidney , evident from augmentation in renal metallothionein ( MT ) expression , depletion of glutathione content and activities of antioxidant and phase II metabolizing enzymes , and enhancement in production of aldehyde products such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal .	tumor promoting inflammation
19590824_s3	Fe-NTA also significantly activated nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) and upregulated the expression of downstream genes : cyclooxygenase 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase and enhancing the production of proinflammatory cytokines : tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
19590824_s4	However , feeding of 0.5% and 1% silymarin diet conferred a significant protection against Fe-NTA induced oxidative stress and inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
19590824_s5	It further augmented MT expression , restored the antioxidant armory , ameliorated NFkappaB activation and decreased the expression of proinflammatory mediators .	tumor promoting inflammation
19590824_s6	Silymarin also suppressed Fe-NTA induced hyperproliferation in kidney , ameliorating renal ornithine decarboxylase activity and DNA synthesis .	
19590824_s7	From these results , it could be concluded that silymarin markedly protects against chemically induced renal cancer and acts plausibly by virtue of its antioxidant , anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activities .	tumor promoting inflammation
19637241_s0	Nucling is a stress-inducible protein associated with apoptosomes .	
19637241_s1	The cytochrome c-triggered formation of apoptosomes represents a key-initiating event in apoptosis .	
19637241_s2	We have recently reported that Nucling regulates the apoptotic pathway by controlling the activation of NF-kappaB as well .	
19637241_s3	Here we show that hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) arising spontaneously against a background of hepatitis occurred more frequently in Nucling-knockout ( KO ) mice than wild-type ( WT ) mice .	
19637241_s4	Biochemical serum testing revealed potential liver dysfunction with hypercholesterolemia in Nucling-KO males .	
19637241_s5	In the background of Nucling-KO mice , we observed the up-regulation of TNFalpha , spontaneous NF-kappaB-activation and the induction of galectin-3 expression in liver .	
19637241_s6	In addition , we observed a decrease in the number of Kupffer cells ( KCs ) in the KO mice .	
19637241_s7	KCs are important for the hepatic immune system , acting as phagocytes or antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) .	avoiding immune destruction
19637241_s8	We found that KCs in Nucling-KO mice were apoptotic possibly through the up-regulation of TNFalpha .	resisting cell death
19637241_s9	These observations indicate that Nucling is important for the regulation of NF-kappaB signals in liver .	
19637241_s10	We propose that Nucling deficiency could be a powerful tool to reveal the NF-kappaB-related molecular networks leading to hepatitis and HCC development .	
19655166_s0	PURPOSE Metabolic dependence on glucose utilisation has been described for different tumours characterised by activation of Akt , upregulation of GLUT1 , M2PK and TKTL1 .	
19655166_s1	To date , however , little is known about glucose metabolism in breast cancer tissue .	
19655166_s2	METHODS We analysed 55 breast cancer specimens , 26 adjacent ductal carcinomas in situ ( DCIS ) and 23 adjacent normal breast tissues for expression of glycolytic markers by immunohistochemistry .	
19655166_s3	RESULTS We found expression of pAkt in 49% , GLUT1 in 25% , M2PK in 68% and TKTL1 in 31% of the tumours investigated .	
19655166_s4	Expression of pAkt and Her2neu are positively correlated with borderline significance ( P = 0.055 ) .	
19655166_s5	Expression of pAkt , GLUT1 and TKTL1 were higher in breast cancer and DCIS than in normal tissue .	
19655166_s6	Surprisingly , M2PK expression was highest in normal breast tissue .	
19655166_s7	CONCLUSIONS We found a glycolytic phenotype in a high percentage of breast cancer samples .	cellular energetics
19655166_s8	Inhibition of glycolysis might evolve as a future option for breast cancer therapy .	cellular energetics
19720422_s0	BACKGROUND &amp ; AIMS Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is an aggressive malignancy with few treatment options .	
19720422_s1	As the status of the tumour immune microenvironment can affect progression of established tumours , we evaluated potential immune mechanisms associated with survival in HCC .	
19720422_s2	METHODS Immune gene expression profiles were analyzed in tumour and non-tumour liver tissues from resected HCC patients using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry .	
19720422_s3	Tumour-infiltrating leukocytes ( TILs ) were isolated to verify the expression of immune genes and to identify proliferating TILs .	
19720422_s4	These parameters were analyzed statistically in relation with patient survival and tumour phenotype ( apoptosis and proliferation ) .	
19720422_s5	RESULTS The immune microenvironment within tumours was found to be heterogeneous , although globally more inert compared to the adjacent non-tumour liver tissue .	avoiding immune destruction
19720422_s6	Univariate analysis in 61 patients identified a group of innate immune genes whose expression within tumours is positively associated with patient survival .	avoiding immune destruction
19720422_s7	TNF , IL6 and CCL2 are the most significant genes , with TNF being an independent predictor of survival in multivariate analysis .	
19720422_s8	The gene set includes macrophage and NK-associated molecules such as TLR4 , TLR3 , CCR2 , NCR3 .	
19720422_s9	Most of these molecules are expressed by TILs .	
19720422_s10	Importantly , proliferating immune cells , predominantly NK and T cells , are present in tumours of patients with longer survival , and exclusively in areas devoid of proliferating tumour cells .	avoiding immune destruction
19720422_s11	NK and CD8(+) T cell densities are correlated positively with tumour apoptosis , and negatively with tumour proliferation .	
19720422_s12	CONCLUSIONS Hence , an inflammatory immune microenvironment within HCC tumours could be an important means to control tumour progression via TIL activation and proliferation .	tumor promoting inflammation
19737566_s0	BACKGROUND &amp ; AIMS GUCY2C is the intestinal receptor for the paracrine hormones guanylin and uroguanylin that converts guanosine-5'-triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) .	
19737566_s1	It functions as a tumor suppressor ; its loss disrupts intestinal homeostasis and promotes tumorigenesis .	
19737566_s2	We investigated the effects of GUCY2C loss on intestinal cell proliferation , metabolism , signaling , and tumorigenesis in mice .	
19737566_s3	METHODS Intestinal cell proliferation and metabolism were examined in Gucy2c(-/-) and colon cancer cells by microscopy , immunoblot , and functional analyses .	
19737566_s4	Microarray analyses compared gene expression profiles of intestine cell from Gucy2c(-/-) and wild-type mice. v akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog ( AKT ) regulation and signaling were examined , and the role of AKT in GUCY2C-dependent tumorigenesis was defined in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice .	
19737566_s5	RESULTS The size and number of intestinal crypts increased in Gucy2c(-/-) mice ; the associated epithelial cells showed accelerated proliferation , increased glycolysis , and reduced oxidative phosphorylation , which was reversed by oral administration of cGMP .	cellular energetics
19737566_s6	Conversely , activating guanylyl cyclase C in human colon cancer cells delayed cell-cycle progression , decreased DNA synthesis and colony formation , reduced glycolysis , and increased mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production .	cellular energetics
19737566_s7	AKT signaling pathways were activated in intestines of Gucy2c(-/-) mice , associated with increased AKT phosphorylation .	
19737566_s8	Disruption of AKT activity , pharmacologically or genetically , reduced DNA synthesis , proliferation , and glycolysis , and increased mitochondrial biogenesis .	cellular energetics
19737566_s9	Intestinal tumorigenesis increased after administration of azoxymethane to Gucy2c(-/-) mice , compared with wild-type mice , but was eliminated in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice .	
19737566_s10	CONCLUSIONS GUCY2C is a tumor suppressor that controls proliferation and metabolism of intestinal epithelial cells by inactivating AKT signaling .	
19737566_s11	This receptor and its ligands , which are paracrine hormones , might be novel candidates for anticolorectal cancer therapy .	
19744468_s0	Inflammatory response plays an important role not only in the normal physiology but also in the pathology such as cancers .	
19744468_s1	As chronic inflammations are associated with malignancies , it is important to prevent inflammation-mediated neoplastic formation , promotion and/or progression .	
19744468_s2	One possible intervention will be using cancer chemopreventive agents such as curcumin ( CUR ) , a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress compound .	
19744468_s3	Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) such as docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) or eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) are potent anti-inflammatory agents by decreasing the production of inflammatory eicosanoids , cytokines , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .	
19744468_s4	The present study aims at examining whether CUR with DHA or EPA would have synergistic anti-inflammatory effects in RAW 264.7 cells .	
19744468_s5	Non-toxic concentrations of single and combination of the compounds were investigated at 6 , 12 and 24h .	
19744468_s6	The nitric oxide ( NO ) suppression effects were most prominent at 24h .	
19744468_s7	All the combinations of CUR and DHA or EPA with lower concentrations of CUR 5 microM and 25 microM of DHA or EPA were found to have synergistic effects in suppressing LPS-stimulated NO and endogenous NO levels .	
19744468_s8	Importantly , very low doses of CUR 2.5 microM and DHA or EPA of 0.78 microM could synergistically suppress the LPS-induced prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) .	
19744468_s9	The combinations were also found to suppress iNOS , COX-2 , 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LOX ) and cPLA(2) but induce HO-1 .	
19744468_s10	Taken together , the present study clearly shows the synergistic anti-inflammatory as well as anti-oxidative stress effects of CUR and PUFA .	tumor promoting inflammation
19744772_s0	PTEN loss of function enhances proliferation , but effects on cellular energy metabolism are less well characterized .	
19744772_s1	We used an inducible PTEN expression vector in a PTEN-null glioma cell line to examine this issue .	
19744772_s2	While proliferation of PTEN-positive cells was insensitive to increases in glucose concentration beyond 2.5mM , PTEN-null cells significantly increased proliferation with increasing glucose concentration across the normal physiologic range to approximately 10mM , coinciding with a shift to glycolysis and " glucose addiction " .	cellular energetics
19744772_s3	This demonstrates that the impact of loss of function of PTEN is modified by glucose concentration , and may be relevant to epidemiologic results linking hyperglycemia to cancer risk and cancer mortality .	cellular energetics
19802014_s0	Earlier studies indicated that density-arrested cancer cells released an unidentified growth inhibitor whose secretion was prevented by overexpression of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D ( cath D ) .	
19802014_s1	In this study , this growth inhibitor was purified by affinity chromatography and identified as the heat shock cognate 70 protein ( hsc70 ) based on its peptide microsequencing and specific antibody recognition .	
19802014_s2	Among intracellular proteins , including other heat shock proteins , only constitutive hsc70 was secreted in response to the high-cell density .	
19802014_s3	Moreover , hsc70 secretion from cancer cells was generated by serum deprivation , whereas its cellular concentration did not change .	
19802014_s4	Prevention of Hsc70 secretion by cath D overexpression was associated with the formation of multilayer cell cultures , thus indicating a loss of contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
19802014_s5	In addition , we showed that supplementing the culture medium with purified hsc70 inhibited cell proliferation in the nanomolar range .	
19802014_s6	Conversely , removal of this extracellular hsc70 from the medium by either retention on ADP-agarose or competition at the Hsc70 binding site restored cell proliferation .	
19802014_s7	Hsc70 appears active in human breast cancer cells and hypersecreted by direct cath D inhibition .	
19802014_s8	These results suggest a new role of this secreted hsc70 chaperone in cell proliferation that might account for the higher tumor growth of cancer cells overexpressing cath D .	
19815061_s0	Manganese , an essential trace nutrient in human beings , has been widely used in the steel industry to improve hardness , stiffness , and strength .	
19815061_s1	With the increased applications of manganese compounds , discharge into the environment has rapidly increased and may exert adverse effects on human health .	
19815061_s2	In this study , manganese toxicity was investigated using cultured T98G cells , which are derived from human glioblasts with the ability to differentiate into several different types of neuroglia .	
19815061_s3	Cytotoxicity was shown in manganese-treated groups ( 100 , 200 , 400 , and 800microM of MnCl(2) ) , and cell viability was decreased to 58.8% of the control group at 2days after treatment with 800microM of MnCl(2) .	
19815061_s4	When cells were treated with manganese for 24h , ROS dose-dependently increased while antioxidant intracellular GSH decreased .	tumor promoting inflammation
19815061_s5	With the generation of ROS , the increased activity of caspase-3 was shown , and was followed by chromatin condensation and breakage , which is an indication of the cellular apoptotic process .	resisting cell death
19815061_s6	ROS also triggered pro-inflammatory responses in cultured T98G cells , which were demonstrated by the increased gene expression and protein levels of IL-6 and IL-8 .	tumor promoting inflammation
19832839_s0	Gliomas are aggressive and almost incurable glial brain tumors which frequently display abnormal platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) signaling .	
19832839_s1	Evidence gained from studies on several in vivo animal models has firmly established a causal connection between aberrant PDGF signaling and the formation of some gliomas .	
19832839_s2	However , only recently has significant knowledge been gained regarding crucial issues such as the glioma cell of origin and the relationship between the transforming stimulus and the cellular characteristics of the resulting tumor .	
19832839_s3	Based on recent evidence , we propose that PDGF can bias cell-fate decisions , driving the acquisition of cell type-specific features by the progeny of multipotent neural progenitors , thus determining the shape and direction of the transformation path .	
19832839_s4	Furthermore , recent data about the cellular mechanisms of PDGF-driven glioma progression and maintenance indicate that PDGF may be required , unexpectedly , to override cell contact inhibition and promote glioma cell infiltration rather than to stimulate cell proliferation .	evading growth suppressors
19836430_s0	Inflammation which is an indispensable participant in tumor progression is intricately linked with redox modulation .	
19836430_s1	The pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNFalpha ) elevates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) .	
19836430_s2	As both TNFalpha and oxidative stress independently play role in regulating cytoskeletal organization and cell survival pathways we investigated whether TNFalpha mediated oxidative stress regulates responses that offer survival advantages to glioblastoma cells .	
19836430_s3	Treatment with TNFalpha elevated Akt phosphorylation in glioma cells .	
19836430_s4	Increased in Akt phosphorylation was concurrent with the decrease in ROS scavenger SOD-1 levels .	tumor promoting inflammation
19836430_s5	TNFalpha mediated increase in Akt phosphorylation was dependent on oxidative stress as Akt phosphorylation was abrogated in the presence of ROS inhibitor and elevated in cells transfected with SOD-1 siRNA .	tumor promoting inflammation
19836430_s6	TNFalpha altered actin cytoskeletal organization and increased Cdc42 levels .	
19836430_s7	This increase in Cdc42 was concomitant with its increased interaction with scaffold protein IQGAP-1 .	
19836430_s8	Also , we report for the first time a ROS dependent interaction between pAkt and IQGAP-1 in TNFalpha treated cells .	tumor promoting inflammation
19836430_s9	Importantly , Akt inhibition not only reversed TNFalpha mediated changes in actin cytoskeletal organization but also abrogated anchorage independent growth .	
19836430_s10	Together , these results suggest that TNFalpha induced oxidative stress affects Akt activation to regulate actin organization and growth of glioma cells .	tumor promoting inflammation
19853600_s0	Tumor endothelial marker ( TEM ) 5 is an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor upregulated in endothelial cells during tumor and physiologic angiogenesis .	
19853600_s1	So far , the mechanisms leading to upregulation of TEM5 and its function during angiogenesis have not been identified .	
19853600_s2	Here , we report that TEM5 expression in endothelial cells is induced during capillary-like network formation on Matrigel , during capillary morphogenesis in a three-dimensional collagen I matrix , and upon confluence on a two-dimensional matrix .	
19853600_s3	TEM5 expression was not induced by a variety of soluble angiogenic factors , including VEGF and bFGF , in subconfluent endothelial cells .	inducing angiogenesis
19853600_s4	TEM5 upregulation was blocked by toxin B from Clostridium difficile , an inhibitor of the small GTPases Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 .	
19853600_s5	The Rho inhibitor C3 transferase from Clostridium botulinum did not affect TEM5 expression , whereas the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 suppressed TEM5 upregulation .	
19853600_s6	An excess of the soluble TEM5 extracellular domain or an inhibitory monoclonal TEM5 antibody blocked contact inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation resulting in multilayered islands within the endothelial monolayer and increased vessel density during capillary formation .	evading growth suppressors
19853600_s7	Based on our results we conclude that TEM5 expression during capillary morphogenesis is induced by the small GTPase Rac and mediates contact inhibition of proliferation in endothelial cells .	evading growth suppressors
19881551_s0	In cancer cells , glucose is often converted into lactic acid , which is known as the ' Warburg effect ' .	
19881551_s1	The reason that cancer cells have a higher rate of aerobic glycolysis , but not oxidative phosphorylation , remains largely unclear .	
19881551_s2	Herein , we proposed an epigenetic mechanism of the Warburg effect .	cellular energetics
19881551_s3	Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-1 ( FBP1 ) , which functions to antagonize glycolysis was downregulated through NF-kappaB pathway in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells .	cellular energetics
19881551_s4	Restoration of FBP1 expression suppressed anchorage-independent growth , indicating the relevance of FBP1 downregulation in carcinogenesis .	
19881551_s5	Indeed , FBP1 was downregulated in gastric carcinomas ( P&lt;0.01 , n=22 ) and gastric cancer cell lines ( 57% , 4/7 ) .	
19881551_s6	Restoration of FBP1 expression reduced growth and glycolysis in gastric cancer cells .	cellular energetics
19881551_s7	Moreover , FBP1 downregulation was reversed by pharmacological demethylation .	
19881551_s8	Its promoter was hypermethylated in gastric cancer cell lines ( 57% , 4/7 ) and gastric carcinomas ( 33% , 33/101 ) .	
19881551_s9	Inhibition of NF-kappaB restored FBP1 expression , partially through demethylation of FBP1 promoter .	
19881551_s10	Notably , Cox regression analysis revealed FBP1 promoter methylation as an independent prognosis predicator for gastric cancer ( hazard ratio : 3.60 , P=0.010 ) .	
19881551_s11	In summary , we found that NF-kappaB functions downstream of Ras to promote epigenetic downregulation of FBP1 .	
19881551_s12	Promoter methylation of FBP1 can be used as a new biomarker for prognosis prediction of gastric cancer .

19909581_s0	OBJECTIVES Recently , it was revealed that carnosine inhibits growth of cells isolated from human malignant glioma .	
19909581_s1	In order to understand how this effect is mediated , experiments were performed that addressed a possible influence of carnosine on energy metabolism .	
19909581_s2	METHODS Cells from the glioma line T98G and primary cultured cells from human malignant glioma were cultivated in the presence of carnosine and inhibitors of cellular energy metabolism .	
19909581_s3	As a specific inhibitor for anaerobic glycolysis , oxamate , and as an inhibitor for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation , potassium cyanide , were used , and the influence on ATP production was determined using cell-based assays .	
19909581_s4	RESULTS The experiments identified glycolysis as crucial for ATP production in gliomas .	cellular energetics
19909581_s5	In addition , ATP production by mitochondrial activity did not significantly contribute to ATP production and carnosine was identified to be an inhibitor of the vital anaerobic glycolysis .	cellular energetics
19909581_s6	DISCUSSION Carnosine might be considered as a potential drug for the treatment of malignant glioma or other tumors since it inhibits the glycolytic energy metabolism that is crucial for cancer cells and malignant gliomas as shown in the current study .	cellular energetics
19909581_s7	This is especially interesting since the dipeptide is a naturally occurring substance that should be well tolerated .	
19913046_s0	The aim of the present study was to evaluate immunomodulator ginsan , a polysaccharide extracted from Panax ginseng , on carbon tetrachloride ( CCl(4))-induced liver injury .	
19913046_s1	BALB/c mice were injected i.p. with ginsan 24 h prior to CCl(4) administration .	
19913046_s2	Serum liver enzyme levels , histology , expression of antioxidant enzymes , and several cytokines/chemokines were subsequently evaluated .	
19913046_s3	Ginsan treatment markedly suppressed the serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) levels , and hepatic histological necrosis increased by CCl(4) treatment .	
19913046_s4	Ginsan inhibited CCl(4) induced lipid peroxidation through the cytochrome P450 2E1 ( CYP2E1 ) downregulation .	
19913046_s5	The hepatoprotective effect of ginsan was attributed to induction of anti-oxidant protein contents , such as superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase , and glutathione peroxidase ( GPX ) as well as restoration of the hepatic glutathione ( GSH ) concentration .	tumor promoting inflammation
19913046_s6	The marked increase of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-1beta , IFN-gamma ) and chemokines ( MCP-1 , MIP-2beta , KC ) in CCl(4) treated mice was additionally attenuated by ginsan , thereby preventing leukocyte infiltration and local inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
19913046_s7	Our results suggest that ginsan effectively prevent liver injury , mainly through downregulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory response .	tumor promoting inflammation
19923925_s0	A common metabolic change in cancer is the acquisition of glycolytic phenotypes .	
19923925_s1	Increased expression of glycolytic enzymes is considered as one contributing factor .	
19923925_s2	The role of mitochondrial defects in acquisition of glycolytic phenotypes has been postulated but remains controversial .	
19923925_s3	Here we show that functional defects in mitochondrial respiration could be induced by oncogenic H-Ras(Q61L) transformation , even though the mitochondrial contents or mass was not reduced in the transformed cells .	
19923925_s4	First , mitochondrial respiration , as measured by mitochondrial oxygen consumption , was suppressed in NIH-3T3 cells transformed with H-Ras(Q61L) .	
19923925_s5	Second , oligomycin or rotenone did not reduce the cellular ATP levels in the H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells , suggesting a diminished role of mitochondrial respiration in the cellular energy metabolism .	
19923925_s6	Third , inhibition of glycolysis with iodoacetic acid reduced ATP levels at a much faster rate in H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells than in the vector control cells .	cellular energetics
19923925_s7	The reduction of cellular ATP levels was reversed by exogenously added pyruvate in the vector control cells but not in H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells .	
19923925_s8	Finally when compared to the HRas(Q61L) transformed cells , the vector control cells had increased resistance toward glucose deprivation .	
19923925_s9	The increased resistance was dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation since rotenone or oligomycin abolished the increased survival of the vector control cells under glucose deprivation .	
19923925_s10	The results also suggest an inability of the H-Ras(Q61L) transformed cells to reactivate mitochondrial respiration under glucose deprivation .	
19923925_s11	Taken together , the data suggest that mitochondrial respiration can be impaired during transformation of NIH-3T3 cells by oncogeneic H-Ras(Q61L) .	
19935714_s0	Inhibition of Notch signaling is effective in inhibiting colon tumorigenesis , but targeting specific components of the pathway may provide more effective strategies .	
19935714_s1	Here we show that the expression of Jagged1 , a ligand for canonical Notch signaling , was restricted to enteroendocrine cells or undetectable in the mucosa of the human small and large intestine , respectively .	
19935714_s2	In contrast , increased expression characterized half of human colon tumors , although not all tumors with elevated Wnt signaling displayed elevated Jagged1 .	
19935714_s3	Increased Jagged1 was also present in intestinal tumors of Apc(1638N/+) and Apc(Min/+) mice , but to a higher level and more frequently in the former , and in 90% of mouse tumors Notch signaling was elevated when Jagged1 was elevated .	
19935714_s4	In the human HT29Cl16E colonic carcinoma cell line , induction of goblet cell differentiation by contact inhibition of growth depended on the loss of Jagged1-mediated Notch activation , with signaling through Notch1 and Notch2 acting redundantly .	evading growth suppressors
19935714_s5	Therefore , targeting of Jagged1 could be effective in downregulating Notch signaling in a subset of tumors , but may avoid the limiting gastrointestinal toxicity caused by pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling .	
19960020_s0	Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) such as hydrogen peroxide ( H(2)O(2) ) , O(*-)(2) and OH(*) participate in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion injury , inflammation and atherosclerosis .	
19960020_s1	Our previous studies have suggested that increased angiotensin II ( Ang II)-forming chymase may be involved in the development of atherosclerosis .	
19960020_s2	However , the regulatory mechanism of chymase expression has not yet been clarified .	
19960020_s3	In this study , we tested whether oxidative stress upregulates mouse mast cell proteinase chymase , mouse mast cell proteinase ( MMCP)-5 or MMCP-4 .	
19960020_s4	We also examined the expression and activity of these proteins after treatment .	
19960020_s5	Cultured mouse mastocytoma cells ( MMC ) displaying chymase-dependent Ang II-forming activity were treated with H(2)O(2) and several aminothiols with or without anti-oxidants .	
19960020_s6	The levels of MMCP-5 and MMCP-4 expression were determined by quantitative RT-PCR ; the level of chymase-dependent Ang II-forming activity was measured by high performance liquid chromatography using Ang I as a substrate .	
19960020_s7	Treatment of MMC with homocysteine ( 0.1-3 mmol l(-1) ) significantly increased MMCP-5 and MMCP-4 expression , as well as Ang II-forming activity .	
19960020_s8	These effects were significantly inhibited by the addition of catalase and further suppressed by the combination of catalase and superoxide dismutase .	tumor promoting inflammation
19960020_s9	Incubation with hydrogen peroxide alone caused a significant increase in Ang II-forming activity , which was completely suppressed by co-treatment with catalase .	
19960020_s10	Furthermore , MMCP-5 and MMCP-4 expression levels were drastically suppressed and chymase induction by homocysteine was diminished under the GATA-inhibited condition .	
19960020_s11	Homocysteine increased mast cell chymase expression and activity through the mechanism of oxidative stress .	tumor promoting inflammation
19960020_s12	Our results suggest that there is a biochemical link between oxidative stress and the local Ang II-forming system .	tumor promoting inflammation
19963135_s0	Energy deregulation and abnormalities of tumor cell metabolism are critical issues in understanding cancer .	
19963135_s1	Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma ( HLRCC ) is an aggressive form of RCC characterized by germline mutation of the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase ( FH ) , and one known to be highly metastatic and unusually lethal .	
19963135_s2	There is considerable utility in establishing preclinical cell and xenograft models for study of disorders of energy metabolism , as well as in development of new therapeutic approaches targeting of tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle enzyme-deficient human cancers .	
19963135_s3	Here we describe a new immortalized cell line , UOK 262 , derived from a patient having aggressive HLRCC-associated recurring kidney cancer .	
19963135_s4	We investigated gene expression , chromosome profiles , efflux bioenergetic analysis , mitochondrial ultrastructure , FH catabolic activity , invasiveness , and optimal glucose requirements for in vitro growth .	
19963135_s5	UOK 262 cells have an isochromosome 1q recurring chromosome abnormality , i(1)(q10) , and exhibit compromised oxidative phosphorylation and in vitro dependence on anaerobic glycolysis consistent with the clinical manifestation of HLRCC .	
19963135_s6	The cells also display glucose-dependent growth , an elevated rate of lactate efflux , and overexpression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and of lactate dehydrogenase A ( LDHA ) .	
19963135_s7	Mutant FH protein was present primarily in edematous mitochondria , but with catalytic activity nearly undetectable .	
19963135_s8	UOK 262 xenografts retain the characteristics of HLRCC histopathology .	
19963135_s9	Our findings indicate that the severe compromise of oxidative phosphorylation and rapid glycolytic flux in UOK 262 are an essential feature of this TCA cycle enzyme-deficient form of kidney cancer .	
19963135_s10	This tumor model is the embodiment of the Warburg effect .	
19963135_s11	UOK 262 provides a unique in vitro and in vivo preclinical model for studying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer .	cellular energetics
20000475_s0	Depleted uranium ( DU ) is commonly used in military armor and munitions , and thus , exposure of soldiers and noncombatants is frequent and widespread .	
20000475_s1	Previous studies have shown that DU has both chemical and radiological toxicity and that the primary route of exposure of DU to humans is through inhalation and ingestion .	
20000475_s2	However , there is limited research information on the potential carcinogenicity of DU in human bronchial cells .	
20000475_s3	Accordingly , we determined the neoplastic transforming ability of particulate DU to human bronchial epithelial cells ( BEP2D ) .	
20000475_s4	We observed the loss of contact inhibition and anchorage independent growth in cells exposed to DU after 24 h .	evading growth suppressors
20000475_s5	We also characterized these DU-induced transformed cell lines and found that 40% of the cell lines exhibit alterations in plating efficiency and no significant changes in the cytotoxic response to DU .	
20000475_s6	Cytogenetic analyses showed that 53% of the DU-transformed cell lines possess a hypodiploid phenotype .	
20000475_s7	These data indicate that human bronchial cells are transformed by DU and exhibit significant chromosome instability consistent with a neoplastic phenotype .	
20016540_s0	A fully intact immune system would be expected to hinder the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy by inhibiting viral replication .	
20016540_s1	Simultaneously , however , it may also enhance antitumor therapy through initiation of proinflammatory , antiviral cytokine responses at the tumor site .	
20016540_s2	The aim of this study was to investigate the role of a fully intact immune system on the antitumor efficacy of an oncolytic virus .	
20016540_s3	In this respect , injection of oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) into subcutaneous B16ova melanomas in C57Bl/6 mice leads to tumor regression , but it is not associated with viral replicative burst in the tumor .	
20016540_s4	In contrast , intratumoral delivery of VSV induces an acute proinflammatory reaction , which quickly resolves concomitantly with virus clearance .	tumor promoting inflammation
20016540_s5	Consistent with the hypothesis that therapy may not be dependent on the ability of VSV to undergo progressive rounds of replication , a single-cycle VSV is equally effective as a fully replication-competent VSV , whereas inactivated viruses do not generate therapy .	
20016540_s6	Even though therapy is dependent on host CD8+ and natural killer cells , these effects are not associated with interferon-gamma-dependent responses against either the virus or tumor .	
20016540_s7	There is , however , a strong correlation between viral gene expression , induction of proinflammatory reaction in the tumor and in vivo therapy .	tumor promoting inflammation
20016540_s8	Overall , our results suggest that acute innate antiviral immune response , which rapidly clears VSV from B16ova tumors , is associated with the therapy observed in this model .	tumor promoting inflammation
20016540_s9	Therefore , the antiviral immune response to an oncolytic virus mediates an intricate balance between safety , restriction of oncolysis and , potentially , significant immune-mediated antitumor therapy .	tumor promoting inflammation
20018866_s0	The high glucose consumption of tumor cells even in an oxygen-rich environment , referred to as the Warburg effect , has been noted as a nearly universal biochemical characteristic of cancer cells .	
20018866_s1	Targeting the glycolysis pathway has been explored as an anti-cancer therapeutic strategy to eradicate cancer based on this fundamental biochemical property of cancer cells .	
20018866_s2	Oncoproteins such as Akt and c-Myc regulate cell metabolism .	
20018866_s3	Accumulating studies have uncovered various molecular mechanisms by which oncoproteins affect cellular metabolism , raising a concern as to whether targeting glycolysis will be equally effective in treating cancers arising from different oncogenic activities .	
20018866_s4	Here , we established a dual-regulatable FL5.12 pre-B cell line in which myristoylated Akt is expressed under the control of doxycycline , and c-Myc , fused to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor , is activated by 4-hydroxytamoxifen .	
20018866_s5	Using this system , we directly compared the effect of these oncoproteins on cell metabolism in an isogenic background .	
20018866_s6	Activation of either Akt or c-Myc leads to the Warburg effect as indicated by increased cellular glucose uptake , glycolysis , and lactate generation .	cellular energetics
20018866_s7	When cells are treated with glycolysis inhibitors , Akt sensitizes cells to apoptosis , whereas c-Myc does not .	
20018866_s8	In contrast , c-Myc but not Akt sensitizes cells to the inhibition of mitochondrial function .	
20018866_s9	This is correlated with enhanced mitochondrial activities in c-Myc cells .	
20018866_s10	Hence , although both Akt and c-Myc promote aerobic glycolysis , they differentially affect mitochondrial functions and render cells susceptible to the perturbation of cellular metabolic programs .	cellular energetics
20026737_s0	IL-15 is a pluripotent antiapoptotic cytokine that signals to cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system and is regarded as a highly promising immunomodulatory agent in cancer therapy .	
20026737_s1	Sepsis is a lethal condition in which apoptosis-induced depletion of immune cells and subsequent immunosuppression are thought to contribute to morbidity and mortality .	
20026737_s2	This study tested the ability of IL-15 to block apoptosis , prevent immunosuppression , and improve survival in sepsis .	
20026737_s3	Mice were made septic using cecal ligation and puncture or Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia .	
20026737_s4	The experiments comprised a 2 x 2 full factorial design with surgical sepsis versus sham and IL-15 versus vehicle .	
20026737_s5	In addition to survival studies , splenic cellularity , canonical markers of activation and proliferation , intracellular pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein expression , and markers of immune cell apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry .	
20026737_s6	Cytokine production was examined both in plasma of treated mice and splenocytes that were stimulated ex vivo .	
20026737_s7	IL-15 blocked sepsis-induced apoptosis of NK cells , dendritic cells , and CD8 T cells .	resisting cell death
20026737_s8	IL-15 also decreased sepsis-induced gut epithelial apoptosis .	resisting cell death
20026737_s9	IL-15 therapy increased the abundance of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 while decreasing proapoptotic Bim and PUMA .	resisting cell death
20026737_s10	IL-15 increased both circulating IFN-gamma , as well as the percentage of NK cells that produced IFN-gamma .	
20026737_s11	Finally , IL-15 increased survival in both cecal ligation and puncture and P. aeruginosa pneumonia .	
20026737_s12	In conclusion , IL-15 prevents two immunopathologic hallmarks of sepsis , namely , apoptosis and immunosuppression , and improves survival in two different models of sepsis .	avoiding immune destruction,resisting cell death
20026737_s13	IL-15 represents a potentially novel therapy of this highly lethal disorder .	
20026743_s0	High concentrations of lactic acid ( LA ) are found under various pathophysiological conditions and are accompanied by an acidification of the environment .	
20026743_s1	To study the impact of LA on TNF secretion , human LPS-stimulated monocytes were cultured with or without LA or the corresponding pH control .	
20026743_s2	TNF secretion was significantly suppressed by low concentrations of LA ( &lt ; or = 10 mM ) , whereas only strong acidification had a similar effect .	
20026743_s3	This result was confirmed in a coculture model of human monocytes with multicellular tumor spheroids .	
20026743_s4	Blocking synthesis of tumor-derived lactate by oxamic acid , an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase , reversed the suppression of TNF secretion in this coculture model .	
20026743_s5	We then investigated possible mechanisms underlying the suppression .	
20026743_s6	Uptake of [ 3-(13)C]lactate by monocytes was shown by hyphenated mass spectrometry .	
20026743_s7	As lactate might interfere with glycolysis , the glycolytic flux of monocytes was determined .	
20026743_s8	We added [ 1,2-(13)C(2)]glucose to the culture medium and measured glucose uptake and conversion into [ 2,3-(13)C(2)]lactate .	
20026743_s9	Activation of monocytes increased the glycolytic flux and the secretion of lactate , whereas oxygen consumption was decreased .	
20026743_s10	Addition of unlabeled LA resulted in a highly significant decrease in [ 2,3-(13)C(2)]lactate secretion , whereas a mere corresponding decrease in pH exerted a less pronounced effect .	
20026743_s11	Both treatments increased intracellular [ 2,3-(13)C(2)]lactate levels .	
20026743_s12	Blocking of glycolysis by 2-deoxyglucose strongly inhibited TNF secretion , whereas suppression of oxidative phosphorylation by rotenone had little effect .	
20026743_s13	These results support the hypothesis that TNF secretion by human monocytes depends on glycolysis and suggest that LA and acidification may be involved in the suppression of TNF secretion in the tumor environment .	cellular energetics
20031246_s0	BACKGROUND &amp ; AIMS Hepatocytes are considered an exception of the paradigmatic inverse correlation between cell proliferation and terminal differentiation .	
20031246_s1	In fact , hepatic vital functions are guaranteed by proliferating parenchymal cells during liver regeneration .	
20031246_s2	However , a fine molecular characterization of the relationship between proliferation and differentiation in hepatocytes has been hampered by the lack of reliable in vivo or in vitro models .	
20031246_s3	METHODS The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program was characterized in the immortalized , untransformed and differentiated hepatocytic cell line MMH , using several techniques .	
20031246_s4	Particularly , two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis combined to tandem mass spectrometry proteomic approach was used .	
20031246_s5	Cell cycle and cell adhesion properties of MMH have been altered using either myc-overexpression and MEK1/2 inhibition or a constitutive active beta-catenin mutant , respectively .	
20031246_s6	RESULTS The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program is stimulated by the exit from the cell cycle induced by cell-cell contact .	
20031246_s7	Comparative proteomic analysis of proliferating versus quiescent hepatocytes validated the importance of contact inhibition , identifying 68 differently expressed gene products , representing 49 unique proteins .	evading growth suppressors
20031246_s8	Notably , enzymes involved in important liver functions such as detoxification processes , lipid metabolism , iron and vitamin A storage and secretion , anti-inflammatory response and exocytosis were found significantly up-regulated in quiescent hepatocytes .	
20031246_s9	Finally , we found that : ( i ) cell cycle arrest induced by MEK1/2 inhibition is not sufficient to induce hepatic product expression ; ( ii ) constitutive activation of beta-catenin counteracts the contact inhibition-induced terminal differentiation .	evading growth suppressors
20031246_s10	CONCLUSION The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program requires a quiescent state maintained by cell-cell contact through the E-cadherin/beta-catenin pathway , rather than the inhibition of proliferation .	
20035374_s0	Candida albicans infections are very frequent in cancer patients , whose immune system is often compromised , but whether this fungal pathogen affects cancer progression is unknown .	
20035374_s1	C. albicans infection involves endogenous production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) .	
20035374_s2	Increased levels of these cytokines have already been correlated with metastasis of most common cancer types .	
20035374_s3	In this study , a well-established model of IL-18-dependent hepatic melanoma metastasis was used to study whether C. albicans can alter the ability of murine B16 melanoma ( B16M ) cells to colonize the liver .	
20035374_s4	First , we determined the ability of intrasplenically ( IS ) injected B16M cells to metastasize into the liver of mice challenged with 5 x 10(4) C. albicans cells by three different routes ( intravenous , IV ; intrasplenic , IS ; or intraperitoneal , IP ) 12 h prior to injection of B16M cells .	
20035374_s5	We demonstrated that C. albicans significantly increased metastasis of B16M cells with all three fungal injection routes .	activating invasion and metastasis
20035374_s6	Pro-metastatic effects occurred when hepatic colonization with B16M cells place after the peak of TNF-alpha and IL-18 levels had been reached in the hepatic blood of fungal challenged mice .	
20035374_s7	In a second set of experiments , mice were fungal challenged 4 days after injection of B16M cells .	
20035374_s8	In these mice , C. albicans also potentiated the growth of established micro-metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
20035374_s9	Significantly , the fungal challenge had pro-metastatic effects without the C. albicans being able to reach the liver , suggesting that soluble factors can promote metastasis in remote sites .	activating invasion and metastasis
20035374_s10	Mouse treatment with antifungal ketoconazol abrogated hepatic TNF-alpha stimulation by C. albicans and prevented the enhancement of hepatic metastasis in fungal challenged-mice .	activating invasion and metastasis
20035374_s11	Therefore , the pro-inflammatory microenvironment generated by the host's systemic response to C. albicans stimulates circulating cancer cells to metastasize in the liver .	activating invasion and metastasis,tumor promoting inflammation
20042714_s0	Mutations in the tumor suppressor tuberin ( TSC2 ) are a common factor in the development of lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) .	
20042714_s1	LAM is a cystic lung disease that is characterized by the infiltration of smooth muscle-like cells into the pulmonary parenchyma .	
20042714_s2	The mechanism by which the loss of tuberin promotes the development of LAM has yet to be elucidated , although several lines of evidence suggest it is due to the metastasis of tuberin-deficient cells .	
20042714_s3	Here we show that tuberin-null cells become nonadherent and invasive .	
20042714_s4	These nonadherent cells express cleaved forms of Î²-catenin .	
20042714_s5	In reporter assays , the Î²-catenin products are transcriptionally active and promote MMP7 expression .	
20042714_s6	Invasion by the tuberin-null cells is mediated by MMP7 .	activating invasion and metastasis
20042714_s7	Examination of LAM tissues shows the expression of cleaved Î²-catenin products and MMP7 consistent with a model that tuberin-deficient cells acquire invasive properties through a Î²-catenin-dependent mechanism , which may underlie the development of LAM .	activating invasion and metastasis
20043298_s0	The present study was designed to investigate the protective efficacy of eugenol against skin cancer and probe into the mechanistic aspects .	
20043298_s1	Skin tumors were initiated by applying 160 nmol DMBA and promoted by twice weekly applications of 8.5 nmol TPA for 28 wk .	
20043298_s2	All mice developed tumors by 13 wk of promotion .	
20043298_s3	However , in mice pretreated with 30 microL eugenol , no tumors were detected until 8 wk ( following anti-initiation protocol ) and until 14 wk ( following antipromotion protocol ) of tumor promotion .	
20043298_s4	PCNA and TUNEL immunohistochemistry of tumors revealed eugenol to ameliorate cell proliferation and elevate apoptosis respectively .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20043298_s5	The effect of eugenol was assessed on specific stages of carcinogenesis .	
20043298_s6	Initiation with DMBA led to a significant upregulation of p53 expression with a concomitant increase in p21(WAF1) levels in epidermal cells indicating induction of damage to the DNA .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
20043298_s7	However , pretreatment with eugenol led to overexpression of these genes , which probably helped stimulate apoptosis of the initiated cells .	
20043298_s8	To ascertain the molecular mechanisms implicated in the antitumor promoting activity of eugenol , its effect was investigated on markers of tumor promotion and inflammation : ODC activity and iNOS and COX-2 expression , and on levels of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 , TNF-alpha , and PGE(2) ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
20043298_s9	Eugenol markedly inhibited all .	
20043298_s10	Eugenol also inhibited the upstream signaling molecule : NF-kappaB , which regulates the expression of these genes .	
20043298_s11	TPA-induced depletion of cutaneous GSH and antioxidant enzymes armory was also precluded by eugenol .	
20043298_s12	From these results , it could be concluded that eugenol markedly protects against chemically induced skin cancer and acts possibly by virtue of its antiproliferative , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant activities .	tumor promoting inflammation
20064835_s0	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) are widely distributed immunotoxic and carcinogenic environmental contaminants , known to affect macrophages .	
20064835_s1	In order to identify their molecular targets in such cells , we have analyzed gene expression profile of primary human macrophages treated by the prototypical PAH benzo(a)pyrene ( BaP ) , using pangenomic oligonucleotides microarrays .	
20064835_s2	Exposure of macrophages to BaP for 8 and 24 h resulted in 96 and 1100 genes , differentially expressed by at least a twofold change factor , respectively .	
20064835_s3	Some of these targets , including the chemokine receptor CXCR5 , the G protein-coupled receptor 35 ( GPR35 ) , and the Ras regulator RASAL1 , have not been previously shown to be affected by PAHs , in contrast to others , such as interleukin-1beta and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) repressor .	
20064835_s4	These BaP-mediated gene regulations were fully validated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays for some selected genes .	
20064835_s5	Their bioinformatic analysis indicated that biological functions linked to immunity , inflammation , and cell death were among the most affected by BaP in human macrophages and that the AhR and p53 signaling pathways were the most significant canonical pathways activated by the PAH .	tumor promoting inflammation
20064835_s6	AhR and p53 implications were moreover fully confirmed by the prevention of BaP-related upregulation of some selected target genes by AhR silencing or the use of pifithrin-alpha , an inhibitor of PAH bioactivation-related DNA damage/p53 pathways .	genomic instability and mutation
20064835_s7	Overall , these data , through identifying genes and signaling pathways targeted by PAHs in human macrophages , may contribute to better understand the molecular basis of the immunotoxicity of these environmental contaminants .	avoiding immune destruction
20067526_s0	Mitochondrial biogenesis , which depends on nuclear as well as mitochondrial genes , occurs in response to increased cellular ATP demand .	
20067526_s1	The nuclear transcriptional factors , estrogen-related receptor alpha ( ERRalpha ) and nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 , are associated with the coordination of the transcriptional machinery governing mitochondrial biogenesis , whereas coactivators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 ( PGC-1 ) family serve as mediators between the environment and this machinery .	
20067526_s2	In the context of proliferating cells , PGC-1-related coactivator ( PRC ) is a member of the PGC-1 family , which is known to act in partnership with nuclear respiratory factors , but no functional interference between PRC and ERRalpha has been described so far .	
20067526_s3	We explored three thyroid cell lines , FTC-133 , XTC.UC1 and RO 82 W-1 , each characterized by a different mitochondrial content , and studied their behavior towards PRC and ERRalpha in terms of respiratory efficiency .	
20067526_s4	Overexpression of PRC and ERRalpha led to increased respiratory chain capacity and mitochondrial mass .	
20067526_s5	The inhibition of ERRalpha decreased cell growth and respiratory chain capacity in all three cell lines .	
20067526_s6	However , the inhibition of PRC and ERRalpha produced a greater effect in the oxidative cell model , decreasing the mitochondrial mass and the phosphorylating respiration , whereas the nonphosphorylating respiration remained unchanged .	
20067526_s7	We therefore hypothesize that the ERRalpha-PRC complex plays a role in arresting the cell cycle through the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in oxidative cells , and through some other pathway in glycolytic cells .	cellular energetics
20080488_s0	RAD51 is a key enzyme of homologous recombination and repair of DNA double-strand breaks .	
20080488_s1	RAD51 mRNA expression levels are significantly increased in laser-microdissected mammary simple carcinomas and their lymph node metastases when compared to adenomas or nonneoplastic mammary gland of the same dog .	
20080488_s2	Here , RAD51 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded mammary carcinomas and their lymph node metastases of 40 dogs , adenomas of 48 dogs , and nonneoplastic mammary gland of 88 dogs .	
20080488_s3	Number of cells with nuclear RAD51 expression was significantly ( P &lt ; or = .05 ) increased in carcinomas when compared to adenomas and metastases .	
20080488_s4	In contrast , no significant differences in the number of RAD51-expressing cells were detected when metastases were compared with adenomas and nonneoplastic gland .	activating invasion and metastasis
20080488_s5	RAD51 expression in carcinomas was correlated with expression in metastases but not with histologic grade .	activating invasion and metastasis
20080488_s6	In conclusion , the increased number of RAD51-expressing cells in carcinomas might indicate genomic instability in these cells .	genomic instability and mutation
20080488_s7	Nevertheless , the increased RAD51 mRNA expression in metastases could not be confirmed by immunohistochemistry .	activating invasion and metastasis
20080744_s0	Cell proliferation is known to be accompanied by activation of glycolysis .	
20080744_s1	We have recently discovered that the glycolysis-promoting enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase , isoform 3 ( PFKFB3 ) , is degraded by the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC/C-Cdh1 , which also degrades cell-cycle proteins .	
20080744_s2	We now show in two different cell types ( neoplastic and nonneoplastic ) that both proliferation and aerobic glycolysis are prevented by overexpression of Cdh1 and enhanced by its silencing .	cellular energetics
20080744_s3	Furthermore , we have coexpressed Cdh1 with PFKFB3--either wild-type or a mutant form resistant to ubiquitylation by APC/C-Cdh1--or with the glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and demonstrated that whereas glycolysis is essential for cell proliferation , its initiation in the presence of active Cdh1 does not result in proliferation .	cellular energetics
20080744_s4	Our experiments indicate that the proliferative response , regardless of whether it occurs in normal or neoplastic cells , is dependent on a decrease in the activity of APC/C-Cdh1 , which activates both proliferation and glycolysis .	cellular energetics
20080744_s5	These observations have implications for cell proliferation , neoplastic transformation , and the prevention and treatment of cancer .	
20080835_s0	The contribution that mitochondrial bioenergetics could have in cancer development is debated .	
20080835_s1	Here , we have generated HCT116-derived colocarcinoma cell lines expressing different levels of the beta catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial H+-adenosine triphosphate synthase to assess the contribution of mitochondrial bioenergetics in colon cancer progression .	
20080835_s2	The generated cells exhibit large ultrastructural , transcriptomic , proteomic and functional differences in their mitochondria and in their in vivo tumor forming capacity .	
20080835_s3	We show that the activity of oxidative phosphorylation defines the rate of glucose utilization by aerobic glycolysis .	cellular energetics
20080835_s4	The aggressive cellular phenotype , which is highly glycolytic , is bound to the deregulated expression of genes involved in metabolic processes , the regulation of the cell cycle , apoptosis , angiogenesis and cell adhesion .	cellular energetics
20080835_s5	Remarkably , the molecular and ultrastructural analysis of the tumors derived from the three HCT116 cell lines under study highlight that tumor promotion inevitably requires the selection of cancer cells with a repressed biogenesis and functional activity of mitochondria , i.e. the highly glycolytic phenotype is selected for tumor development .	cellular energetics
20080835_s6	The tumor forming potential of the cells is a non-genetically acquired condition that provides the cancer cell with a cell-death resistant phenotype .	
20080835_s7	An abrogated mitochondrial respiration contributes to a diminished potential for reactive oxygen species signaling in response to 5-fluorouracil treatment .	
20080835_s8	Treatment of cancer cells with dichloroacetate partially restores the functional differentiation of mitochondria and promotes tumor regression , emphasizing the reversible nature of the metabolic trait of cancer .	
20082738_s0	Diets rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with lower risk of cancer which may be conferred in part by the antioxidant properties of these foods .	
20082738_s1	However , antioxidant supplementation or increased consumption of antioxidant-rich foods has been reported to have inconsistent effects on DNA damage .	
20082738_s2	The present work ( the DART study ) investigated the extent of inter-individual variation in DNA damage , the capacity for base excision repair ( BER ) and the responses of both variables to supplementation with an antioxidant supplement for 6 weeks .	
20082738_s3	There was a wide inter-individual variation in endogenous lymphocyte DNA strand breaks ( 8-fold variation ) , in damage after a challenge with H2O2 ( 16-fold variation ) and in DNA repair ( 41-fold variation ) measured using the comet assay .	genomic instability and mutation
20082738_s4	When stratified into tertiles according to the pre-supplementation level of endogenous DNA damage , there was a statistically significant decrease in DNA damage after supplementation in the tertile with the highest pre-supplementation level of damage .	genomic instability and mutation
20082738_s5	There was no effect of supplementation on BER .	genomic instability and mutation
20082738_s6	Endogenous DNA damage level before supplementation was significantly different ( P = 0.037 ) between the three genotypes for the Val16Ala single nucleotide polymorphism in manganese superoxide dismutase ( rs4880 ) with individuals homozygous/wild type showing less damage than those carrying the alanine variant .	genomic instability and mutation
20086003_s0	PURPOSE Genomic complexity is present in approximately 15% to 30% of all chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) and has emerged as a strong independent predictor of rapid disease progression and short remission duration in CLL .	
20086003_s1	We conducted this study to advance our understanding of the causes of genomic complexity in CLL .	
20086003_s2	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We have obtained quantitative measurements of radiation-induced apoptosis and radiation-induced ATM autophosphorylation in purified CLL cells from 158 and 140 patients , respectively , and have used multivariate analysis to identify independent contributions of various biological variables on genomic complexity in CLL .	
20086003_s3	RESULTS Here , we identify a strong independent effect of radiation resistance on elevated genomic complexity in CLL and describe radiation resistance as a predictor for shortened CLL survival .	
20086003_s4	Furthermore , using multivariate analysis , we identify del17p/p53 aberrations , del11q , del13q14 type II ( invariably resulting in Rb loss ) , and CD38 expression as independent predictors of genomic complexity in CLL , with aberrant p53 as a predictor of approximately 50% of genomic complexity in CLL .	
20086003_s5	Focusing on del11q , we determined that normalized ATM activity was a modest predictor of genomic complexity but was not independent of del11q .	
20086003_s6	Through single nucleotide polymorphism array-based fine mapping of del11q , we identified frequent monoallelic loss of Mre11 and H2AFX in addition to ATM , indicative of compound del11q-resident gene defects in the DNA double-strand break response .	genomic instability and mutation
20086003_s7	CONCLUSIONS Our quantitative analysis links multiple molecular defects , including for the first time del11q and large 13q14 deletions ( type II ) , to elevated genomic complexity in CLL , thereby suggesting mechanisms for the observed clinical aggressiveness of CLL in patients with unstable genomes .	
20086180_s0	Acute endothelial cell apoptosis and microvascular compromise couple gastrointestinal tract irradiation to reproductive death of intestinal crypt stem cell clonogens ( SCCs ) following high-dose radiation .	
20086180_s1	Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of endothelial apoptosis prevents intestinal damage , but as the radiation dose is escalated , SCCs become directly susceptible to an alternate cell death mechanism , mediated via ceramide synthase ( CS)-stimulated de novo synthesis of the proapoptotic sphingolipid ceramide , and p53-independent apoptosis of crypt SCCs .	
20086180_s2	We previously reported that ataxia-telangiectasia mutated deficiency resets the primary radiation lethal pathway , allowing CS-mediated apoptosis at the low-dose range of radiation .	
20086180_s3	The mechanism for this event , termed target reordering , remains unknown .	
20086180_s4	Here , we show that inactivation of DNA damage repair pathways signals CS-mediated apoptosis in crypt SCCs , presumably via persistent unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) .	genomic instability and mutation
20086180_s5	Genetic loss of function of sensors and transducers of DNA DSB repair confers the CS-mediated lethal pathway in intestines of sv129/B6Mre11(ATLD1/ATLD1) and C57BL/6(Prkdc/SCID) ( severe combined immunodeficient ) mice exposed to low-dose radiation .	genomic instability and mutation
20086180_s6	In contrast , CS-mediated SCC lethality was mitigated in irradiated gain-of-function Rad50(s/s) mice , and epistasis studies order Rad50 upstream of Mre11 .	
20086180_s7	These studies suggest unrepaired DNA DSBs as causative in target reordering in intestinal SCCs .	genomic instability and mutation
20086180_s8	As such , we provide an in vivo model of DNA damage repair that is standardized , can be exploited to understand allele-specific regulation in intact tissue , and is pharmacologically tractable .	genomic instability and mutation
20090913_s0	CEACAM1 , CEA/CEACAM5 , and CEACAM6 are cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) of the carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) family that have been shown to be deregulated in lung cancer and in up to 50% of all human cancers .	
20090913_s1	However , little is known about the functional impact of these molecules on undifferentiated cell growth and tumor progression .	
20090913_s2	Here we demonstrate that cell surface expression of CEACAM1 on confluent A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells plays a critical role in differentiated , contact-inhibited cell growth .	evading growth suppressors
20090913_s3	Interestingly , CEACAM1-L , but not CEACAM1-S , negatively regulates proliferation via its ITIM domain , while in proliferating cells no CEACAM expression is detectable .	
20090913_s4	Furthermore , we show for the first time that CEACAM6 acts as an inducer of cellular proliferation in A549 cells , likely by interfering with the contact-inhibiting signal triggered by CEACAM1-4L , leading to undifferentiated anchorage-independent cell growth .	evading growth suppressors
20090913_s5	We also found that A549 cells expressed significant amounts of non-membrane anchored variants of CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 , representing a putative source for the increased CEACAM5/6 serum levels frequently found in lung cancer patients .	
20090913_s6	Taken together , our data suggest that post-confluent contact inhibition is established and maintained by CEACAM1-4L , but disturbances of CEACAM1 signalling by CEACAM1-4S and other CEACAMs lead to undifferentiated cell growth and malignant transformation .	evading growth suppressors
20092614_s0	BACKGROUND Folate ( vitamin B9 ) is essential for cellular proliferation as it is involved in the biosynthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate ( dTMP ) and s-adenosylmethionine ( AdoMet ) .	
20092614_s1	The link between folate depletion and the genesis and progression of cancers of epithelial origin is of high clinical relevance , but still unclear .	
20092614_s2	We recently demonstrated that sensitivity to low folate availability is affected by the rate of polyamine biosynthesis , which is prominent in prostate cells .	
20092614_s3	We , therefore , hypothesized that prostate cells might be highly susceptible to genetic , epigenetic and phenotypic changes consequent to folate restriction .	
20092614_s4	RESULTS We studied the consequences of long-term , mild folate depletion in a model comprised of three syngenic cell lines derived from the transgenic adenoma of the mouse prostate ( TRAMP ) model , recapitulating different stages of prostate cancer ; benign , transformed and metastatic .	
20092614_s5	High-performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that mild folate depletion ( 100 nM ) sufficed to induce imbalance in both the nucleotide and AdoMet pools in all prostate cell lines .	
20092614_s6	Random oligonucleotide-primed synthesis ( ROPS ) revealed a significant increase in uracil misincorporation and DNA single strand breaks , while spectral karyotype analysis ( SKY ) identified five novel chromosomal rearrangements in cells grown with mild folate depletion .	genomic instability and mutation
20092614_s7	Using global approaches , we identified an increase in CpG island and histone methylation upon folate depletion despite unchanged levels of total 5-methylcytosine , indicating a broad effect of folate depletion on epigenetic regulation .	
20092614_s8	These genomic changes coincided with phenotype changes in the prostate cells including increased anchorage-independent growth and reduced sensitivity to folate depletion .	
20092614_s9	CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that prostate cells are highly susceptible to genetic and epigenetic changes consequent to mild folate depletion as compared to cells grown with supraphysiological amounts of folate ( 2 microM ) routinely used in tissue culture .	
20092614_s10	In addition , we elucidate for the first time the contribution of these aspects to consequent phenotype changes in epithelial cells .	
20092614_s11	These results provide a strong rationale for studying the effects of folate manipulation on the prostate in vivo , where cells might be more sensitive to changes in folate status resulting from folate supplementation or antifolate therapeutic approaches .	
20092964_s0	PURPOSE Radiation therapy appears to kill cells mainly by inducing DNA double-strand breaks .	
20092964_s1	We investigated whether the DNA repair gene expression status might influence the risk of locoregional recurrence ( LRR ) in breast cancer patients .	
20092964_s2	METHODS AND MATERIALS We used a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR-based approach to measure messenger RNA levels of 20 selected DNA repair genes in tumor samples from 97 breast cancer patients enrolled in a phase III trial ( Centre RenÃ© Huguenin cohort ) .	
20092964_s3	Normalized mRNA levels were tested for an association with LRR-free survival ( LRR-FS ) and overall survival ( OS ) .	
20092964_s4	The findings were validated in comparison with those of an independent cohort ( Netherlands Cancer Institute ( NKI ) cohort ) .	
20092964_s5	Multivariate analysis encompassing known prognostic factors was used to assess the association between DNA repair gene expression and patient outcome .	
20092964_s6	RESULTS RAD51 was the only gene associated with LRR in both cohorts .	
20092964_s7	With a median follow-up of 126 months in the CRH cohort , the 5-year LRR-FS and OS rates were 100% and 95% in the 61 patients with low RAD51 expression , compared with 70% and 69% in the 36 patients with high RAD51 expression , respectively ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
20092964_s8	RAD51 overexpression was associated with a higher risk of LRR ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 12.83 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] , 3.6-45.6 ) and death ( HR , 4.10 ; 95% CI , 1.7-9.7 ) .	
20092964_s9	RAD51 overexpression was also significantly associated with shorter LRR-FS and OS in the NKI cohort .	
20092964_s10	CONCLUSIONS Overexpression of RAD51 , a key component of the homologous DNA repair pathway , is associated with poor breast cancer outcome .	genomic instability and mutation
20092964_s11	This finding warrants prospective studies of RAD51 as a prognosticator and therapeutic target .	
20094029_s0	ATM(Tel1) and ATR(Rad3) checkpoint kinases phosphorylate the C-terminus of histone H2AX ( H2A in yeasts ) in chromatin flanking DNA damage , establishing a recruitment platform for checkpoint and repair proteins .	
20094029_s1	Phospho-H2A/X ( gammaH2A/X)-binding proteins at double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) have been characterized , but those required for replication stress responses are unknown .	
20094029_s2	Here , we present genetic , biochemical , small angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS ) , and X-ray structural studies of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Brc1 , a 6-BRCT-domain protein that is structurally related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rtt107 and mammalian PTIP .	
20094029_s3	Brc1 binds gammaH2A to form spontaneous and DNA damage-induced nuclear foci .	genomic instability and mutation
20094029_s4	Spontaneous Brc1 foci colocalize with ribosomal DNA repeats , a region prone to fork pausing and genomic instability , whereas DNA damage-induced Brc1 foci colocalize with DSB response factors. gammaH2A binding is critical for Brc1 function .	genomic instability and mutation
20094029_s5	The 1.45 A resolution crystal structure of Brc1-gammaH2A complex shows how variable BRCT insertion loops sculpt tandem-BRCT phosphoprotein-binding pockets to facilitate unique phosphoprotein-interaction specificities , and unveils an acidic DNA-mimicking Brc1 surface .	
20094029_s6	From these results , Brc1 docking to gammaH2A emerges as a critical chromatin-specific response to replication-associated DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
20094972_s0	Epidemiological studies exploring the connection between hypertension and cancer incidence find a higher cancer mortality in hypertensive patients , particularly elevated in hypertension associated with a stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system .	
20094972_s1	Primary aldosteronism , with plasma aldosterone levels between 0.5 and 1 nM ( 18-36 ng/dL ) and local aldosterone levels up to 500 nM ( 18,000 ng/dL ) , is now recognised as a more common cause for hypertension .	
20094972_s2	We recently found angiotensin II to be genotoxic due to its induction of oxidative stress .	
20094972_s3	Since aldosterone in higher concentrations also has oxidative effects , its potential genotoxic action in pig LLC-PK1 cells with properties of proximal tubules was analysed .	
20094972_s4	DNA damage was evaluated by two test systems : the comet assay , and the micronucleus frequency test .	
20094972_s5	The results showed that aldosterone concentrations starting from 10 nM ( 360 ng/dL ) caused a significant increase of DNA damage monitored with the comet assay in LLC-PK1 , while there was no change in cell vitality and proliferation .	genomic instability and mutation
20094972_s6	The micronucleus frequency test revealed that 10 nM aldosterone also leads to the formation of micronuclei .	genomic instability and mutation
20094972_s7	Furthermore , the formation of superoxide radicals in the cells by this aldosterone concentration could be detected with the superoxide-specific stain dihydroethidium .	
20094972_s8	Further evidence for oxidative stress-induced DNA damage was its reversibility by the antioxidants tempol and catalase .	genomic instability and mutation
20094972_s9	Addition of the steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone or the novel selective nonsteroidal antagonist ( R)-BR-4628 reduced the DNA damage and the amount of superoxide radicals indicating a receptor-dependent process .	genomic instability and mutation
20099325_s0	The purpose of this study was to combine a three-dimensional NMR-compatible bioreactor with hyperpolarized ( 13)C NMR spectroscopy in order to probe cellular metabolism in real time .	
20099325_s1	JM1 ( immortalized rat hepatoma ) cells were cultured in a three-dimensional NMR-compatible fluidized bioreactor .	
20099325_s2	( 31)P spectra were acquired before and after each injection of hyperpolarized [ 1-(13)C ] pyruvate and subsequent ( 13)C spectroscopy at 11.7 T .	
20099325_s3	( 1)H and two-dimensional ( 1)H-(1)H-total correlation spectroscopy spectra were acquired from extracts of cells grown in uniformly labeled ( 13)C-glucose , on a 16.4 T , to determine ( 13)C fractional enrichment and distribution of ( 13)C label .	
20099325_s4	JM1 cells were found to have a high rate of aerobic glycolysis in both two-dimensional culture and in the bioreactor , with 85% of the ( 13)C label from uniformly labeled ( 13)C-glucose being present as either lactate or alanine after 23 h .	cellular energetics
20099325_s5	Flux measurements of pyruvate through lactate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase in the bioreactor system were 12.18 +/- 0.49 nmols/sec/10(8) cells and 2.39 +/- 0.30 nmols/sec/10(8) cells , respectively , were reproducible in the same bioreactor , and were not significantly different over the course of 2 days .	
20099325_s6	Although this preliminary study involved immortalized cells , this combination of technologies can be extended to the real-time metabolic exploration of primary benign and cancerous cells and tissues prior to and after therapy .	
20100566_s0	Multivitamin preparation ( MVP ) is part of total parenteral nutrition given to premature infants .	
20100566_s1	Photoactivated MVP carries an important load in peroxides , but their cellular effects have not yet been determined .	
20100566_s2	We hypothesized that these peroxides may elicit a DNA-damage response .	
20100566_s3	We found that photoactivation of MVP and the resulting peroxide production were time-dependent and required the simultaneous presence of ascorbic acid and riboflavin .	
20100566_s4	Cells treated with photoactivated MVP showed strongly stimulated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation , an early DNA-damage response in mammals .	genomic instability and mutation
20100566_s5	Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation stimulation was dependent on the presence of ascorbic acid and riboflavin in the photoactivated MVP .	
20100566_s6	It did not occur in the presence of a specific PARP inhibitor nor in mouse fibroblasts deficient in PARP-1 .	
20100566_s7	Photoactivated MVP was able to induce single- and double-strand breaks in DNA , with a predominance of single-stand breaks .	genomic instability and mutation
20100566_s8	The presence of double-strand breaks was further confirmed using a 53PB1 focus analysis .	genomic instability and mutation
20100566_s9	Finally , photoactivated MVP was shown to be toxic to human cells and induced caspase-independent cell death .	resisting cell death
20100566_s10	These results suggest that photoactivated MVP carries an important toxic load able to damage DNA and induce cell death .	genomic instability and mutation
20100566_s11	This study also emphasizes the importance of protecting MVP solution from light before use in preterm infants .	
20100593_s0	It is thought that high linear energy transfer ( LET ) radiation induces more complex DNA damage than low-LET particles , specifically clustered DNA damage that causes cells to repair DNA double strand breaks ( DSB ) more slowly and leads to severe biological consequences .	
20100593_s1	The present study aimed to investigate the role of exogenously added glutathione ( GSH ) on ( 12)C-beam ( 287keV/mum ) and ( 7)Li-beam ( 60keV/mum ) induced chromosome aberration ( CA ) formation , particularly on exchange aberration formation .	
20100593_s2	In order to characterize the role of GSH in the joining of DNA DSBs , we induced DNA lesions with bleomycin ( Blem ) in conjunction with either high- or low-LET radiation ( X-rays ) since the chemistry of the free DNA ends created by Blem and X-rays is similar .	genomic instability and mutation
20100593_s3	CHO cells were exposed to reduced GSH at a concentration of 2mM for 3h before radiation .	
20100593_s4	Treatment with Blem ( 20mug/ml ) was carried out for 2h before the cells were exposed to radiation .	
20100593_s5	Our results show that the frequency of chromosomal aberration increases with increased LET .	genomic instability and mutation
20100593_s6	Heavy ion exposed cells show a higher frequency of CA over time than do X-irradiated cells .	genomic instability and mutation
20100593_s7	An analysis of the first post-irradiation mitosis of exposed CHO cells shows that high-LET radiation induces more breaks than exchange-type aberrations and exogenous GSH has no influence on high-LET radiation-induced DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
20100593_s8	The DNA lesions induced by low-LET radiation interact relatively strongly with Blem-induced lesions whereas interaction between Blem and high-LET radiations was poor .	
20100593_s9	This could be attributed to differences in repair kinetics and qualitative differences in the DNA lesions induced by Blem and high-LET radiation .	genomic instability and mutation
20101074_s0	Recently , the use of gold nanoparticles as potential tumor selective radiosensitizers has been proposed as a breakthrough in radiotherapy .	
20101074_s1	Experiments in living cells and in vivo have demonstrated the efficiency of the metal nanoparticles when combined with low energy x-ray radiations ( below conventional 1 MeV Linac radiation ) .	
20101074_s2	Further studies on DNA have been performed in order to better understand the fundamental processes of sensitization and to further improve the method .	
20101074_s3	In this work , we propose a new strategy based on the combination of platinum nanoparticles with irradiation by fast ions effectively used in hadron therapy .	
20101074_s4	It is observed in particular that nanoparticles enhance strongly lethal damage in DNA , with an efficiency factor close to 2 for double strand breaks .	genomic instability and mutation
20101074_s5	In order to disentangle the effect of the nano-design architecture , a comparison with the effects of dispersed metal atoms at the same concentration has been performed .	
20101074_s6	It is thus shown that the sensitization in nanoparticles is enhanced due to auto-amplified electronic cascades inside the nanoparticles , which reinforces the energy deposition in the close vicinity of the metal .	
20101074_s7	Finally , the combination of fast ion radiation ( hadron therapy ) with platinum nanoparticles should strongly improve cancer therapy protocols .	
20103683_s0	PURPOSE This study aims to investigate the role of the aberrant expression of Transkelolase-like 1 ( TKTL1 ) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) tumorigenesis and to characterize TKTL1 contribution to HNSCC tumorigenesis through aerobic glycolysis and HIF1alpha stabilization .	
20103683_s1	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN TKTL1 promoter hypomethylation and mRNA/protein aberrant expression were studied in human HNSCC tumor samples and normal mucosas .	
20103683_s2	Oncogenic functions of TKTL1 were examined in HNSCC cell line panels and tumor xenograft models with TKTL1 expression construct .	
20103683_s3	The metabolite levels of fructose-6-phosphate , glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate , pyruvate , lactate , and the levels of HIF1alpha protein and its downsteam glycolytic targets were compared between the TKTL1-expressing and vehicle-expressing HNSCC cells .	
20103683_s4	Meanwhile , the effects of HIF1alpha/glycolytic inhibitors were evaluated on the TKTL1 transfectants .	
20103683_s5	RESULTS TKTL1 exhibits high frequency of promoter hypomethylation in HNSCC tumors compared with the normal mucosas , correlating with its overexpression in HNSCC .	
20103683_s6	Overexpression of TKTL1 in HNSCC cells promoted cellular proliferation and enhanced tumor growth in vitro and in vivo .	
20103683_s7	Overexpression of TKTL1 increased the production of fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate , in turn elevating the production of pyruvate and lactate , resulting in the normoxic stabilization of the malignancy-promoting transcription factor HIF1alpha and the upregulation of downstream glycolytic enzymes .	cellular energetics
20103683_s8	Notably , the reduction of TKTL1 expression decreased HIF1alpha accumulation and inhibition with HIF1alpha and/or the glycolysis inhibitor could abrogate the growth effects mediated by TKTL1 overexpression .	
20103683_s9	CONCLUSION TKTL1 is a novel candidate oncogene that is epigenetically activated by aberrant hypomethlation and contributes to a malignant phenotype through altered glycolytic metabolism and HIF1alpha accumulation .	cellular energetics
20107607_s0	BRIT1 protein ( also known as MCPH1 ) contains 3 BRCT domains which are conserved in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and other important molecules involved in DNA damage signaling , DNA repair , and tumor suppression .	
20107607_s1	BRIT1 mutations or aberrant expression are found in primary microcephaly patients as well as in cancer patients .	
20107607_s2	Recent in vitro studies suggest that BRIT1/MCPH1 functions as a novel key regulator in the DNA damage response pathways .	
20107607_s3	To investigate its physiological role and dissect the underlying mechanisms , we generated BRIT1(-/-) mice and identified its essential roles in mitotic and meiotic recombination DNA repair and in maintaining genomic stability .	
20107607_s4	Both BRIT1(-/-) mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation .	genomic instability and mutation
20107607_s5	BRIT1(-/-) MEFs and T lymphocytes exhibited severe chromatid breaks and reduced RAD51 foci formation after irradiation .	genomic instability and mutation
20107607_s6	Notably , BRIT1(-/-) mice were infertile and meiotic homologous recombination was impaired .	genomic instability and mutation
20107607_s7	BRIT1-deficient spermatocytes exhibited a failure of chromosomal synapsis , and meiosis was arrested at late zygotene of prophase I accompanied by apoptosis .	
20107607_s8	In mutant spermatocytes , DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) were formed , but localization of RAD51 or BRCA2 to meiotic chromosomes was severely impaired .	genomic instability and mutation
20107607_s9	In addition , we found that BRIT1 could bind to RAD51/BRCA2 complexes and that , in the absence of BRIT1 , recruitment of RAD51 and BRCA2 to chromatin was reduced while their protein levels were not altered , indicating that BRIT1 is involved in mediating recruitment of RAD51/BRCA2 to the damage site .	
20107607_s10	Collectively , our BRIT1-null mouse model demonstrates that BRIT1 is essential for maintaining genomic stability in vivo to protect the hosts from both programmed and irradiation-induced DNA damages , and its depletion causes a failure in both mitotic and meiotic recombination DNA repair via impairing RAD51/BRCA2's function and as a result leads to infertility and genomic instability in mice .	genomic instability and mutation
20107609_s0	Topoisomerase inhibitors such as camptothecin and etoposide are used as anti-cancer drugs and induce double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in genomic DNA in cycling cells .	
20107609_s1	These DSBs are often covalently bound with polypeptides at the 3 ' and 5 ' ends .	
20107609_s2	Such modifications must be eliminated before DSB repair can take place , but it remains elusive which nucleases are involved in this process .	
20107609_s3	Previous studies show that CtIP plays a critical role in the generation of 3 ' single-strand overhang at " clean " DSBs , thus initiating homologous recombination ( HR)-dependent DSB repair .	
20107609_s4	To analyze the function of CtIP in detail , we conditionally disrupted the CtIP gene in the chicken DT40 cell line .	
20107609_s5	We found that CtIP is essential for cellular proliferation as well as for the formation of 3 ' single-strand overhang , similar to what is observed in DT40 cells deficient in the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex .	
20107609_s6	We also generated DT40 cell line harboring CtIP with an alanine substitution at residue Ser332 , which is required for interaction with BRCA1 .	
20107609_s7	Although the resulting CtIP(S332A/-/-) cells exhibited accumulation of RPA and Rad51 upon DNA damage , and were proficient in HR , they showed a marked hypersensitivity to camptothecin and etoposide in comparison with CtIP(+/-/-) cells .	
20107609_s8	Finally , CtIP(S332A/-/-)BRCA1(-/-) and CtIP(+/-/-)BRCA1(-/-) showed similar sensitivities to these reagents .	
20107609_s9	Taken together , our data indicate that , in addition to its function in HR , CtIP plays a role in cellular tolerance to topoisomerase inhibitors .	
20107609_s10	We propose that the BRCA1-CtIP complex plays a role in the nuclease-mediated elimination of oligonucleotides covalently bound to polypeptides from DSBs , thereby facilitating subsequent DSB repair .	genomic instability and mutation
20107790_s0	PURPOSE Monoclonal anti-CD33 antibodies conjugated with toxic calicheamicin derivative ( gemtuzumab ozogamicin , GO ) are a novel therapy option for acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) .	
20107790_s1	Key prognostic factors for patients with AML are high CD33 expression on the leukaemic cells and the ability to overcome mechanisms of resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapies , including drug efflux or other mechanisms decreasing apoptosis .	
20107790_s2	Alpha particle-emitting radionuclides overwhelm such anti-apoptotic mechanisms by producing numerous DNA double-stranded breaks ( DSBs ) accompanied by decreased DNA repair .	
20107790_s3	METHODS We labelled anti-CD33 antibodies with the alpha-emitter ( 211)At and compared survival of leukaemic HL-60 and K-562 cells treated with the ( 211)At-labelled antibodies , GO or unlabelled antibodies as controls .	
20107790_s4	We also measured caspase-3/7 activity , DNA fragmentation and necrosis in HL-60 cells after treatment with the different antibodies or with free ( 211)At .	
20107790_s5	RESULTS The mean labelling ratio of ( 211)At-labelled antibodies was 1:1,090 +/- 364 ( range : 1:738-1:1,722 ) in comparison to 2-3:1 for GO .	
20107790_s6	Tumour cell binding of ( 211)At-anti-CD33 was high in the presence of abundant CD33 expression and could be specifically blocked by unlabelled anti-CD33 .	
20107790_s7	( 211)At-anti-CD33 decreased survival significantly more than did GO at comparable dilution ( 1:1,000 ) .	
20107790_s8	No significant differences in induction of apoptosis or necrosis or DNA DSB or in decreased survival were observed after ( 211)At-anti-CD33 ( 1:1,090 ) versus GO ( 1:1 ) treatment .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
20107790_s9	CONCLUSION Our results suggest that ( 211)At is a promising , highly cytotoxic radioimmunotherapy in CD33-positive leukaemia and kills tumour cells more efficiently than does calicheamicin-conjugated antibody .	
20107790_s10	Labelling techniques leading to higher chemical yield and specific activities must be developed to increase ( 211)At-anti-CD33 therapeutic effects .	
20107801_s0	PURPOSE Anthracyclines have been widely used as antitumor agents , playing a crucial role in the successful treatment of many types of cancer , despite some side effects related to cardiotoxicity .	
20107801_s1	New anthracyclines have been designed and tested , but the first ones discovered , doxorubicin and daunorubicin , continue to be the drugs of choice .	
20107801_s2	Despite their extensive use in chemotherapy , little is known about the DNA repair mechanisms involved in the removal of lesions caused by anthracyclines .	
20107801_s3	The anthracycline cosmomycin D is the main product isolated from Streptomyces olindensis , characterized by a peculiar pattern of glycosylation with two trisaccharide rings attached to the A ring of the tetrahydrotetracene .	
20107801_s4	METHODS We assessed the induction of apoptosis ( Sub-G1 ) by cosmomycin D in nucleotide excision repair-deficient fibroblasts ( XP-A and XP-C ) as well as the levels of DNA damage ( alkaline comet assay ) .	
20107801_s5	RESULTS Treatment of XP-A and XP-C cells with cosmomycin D resulted in apoptosis in a time-dependent manner , with highest apoptosis levels observed 96 h after treatment .	resisting cell death
20107801_s6	The effects of cosmomycin D were equivalent to those obtained with doxorubicin .	
20107801_s7	The broad caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK strongly inhibited apoptosis in these cells , and DNA damage induced by cosmomycin D was confirmed by alkaline comet assay .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
20107801_s8	CONCLUSIONS Cosmomycin D induced time-dependent apoptosis in nucleotide excision repair-deficient fibroblasts .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
20107801_s9	Despite similar apoptosis levels , cosmomycin D caused considerably lower levels of DNA damage compared to doxorubicin .	
20107801_s10	This may be related to differences in structure between cosmomycin D and doxorubicin .	
20110254_s0	We have developed fluorescent probes for the detection of strand scission in the excision repair of oxidatively damaged bases .	
20110254_s1	They were hairpin-shaped oligonucleotides , each containing an isomer of thymine glycol or 5,6-dihydrothymine as a damaged base in the center , with a fluorophore and a quencher at the 5'- and 3'-ends , respectively .	
20110254_s2	Fluorescence was detected when the phosphodiester linkage at the damage site was cleaved by the enzyme , because the short fragment bearing the fluorophore could not remain in a duplex form hybridized to the rest of the molecule at the incubation temperature .	
20110254_s3	The substrate specificities of Escherichia coli endonuclease III and its human homolog , NTH1 , determined by using these probes agreed with those determined previously by gel electrophoresis using ( 32)P-labeled substrates .	
20110254_s4	Kinetic parameters have also been determined by this method .	
20110254_s5	Since different fluorophores were attached to the oligonucleotides containing each lesion , reactions with two types of substrates were analyzed separately in a single tube , by changing the excitation and detection wavelengths .	
20110254_s6	These probes were degraded during an incubation with a cell extract .	
20110254_s7	Therefore , phosphorothioate linkages were incorporated to protect the probes from nonspecific nucleases , and the base excision repair activity was successfully detected in HeLa cells .	genomic instability and mutation
20110356_s0	Cancer cells constantly adapt to oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) suppression resulting from hypoxia or mitochondria defects .	
20110356_s1	Under the OXPHOS suppression , AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) regulates global metabolism adjustments , but its activation has been found to be transient .	
20110356_s2	Whether cells can maintain cellular ATP homeostasis and survive beyond the transient AMPK activation is not known .	
20110356_s3	Here , we study the bioenergetic adaptation to the OXPHOS inhibitor oligomycin in a group of cancer cells .	cellular energetics
20110356_s4	We found that oligomycin at 100 ng/ml completely inhibits OXPHOS activity in 1 h and induces various levels of glycolysis gains by 6 h , from which we calculate the bioenergetic organizations of cancer cells .	cellular energetics
20110356_s5	In glycolysis-dominant cells , oligomycin does not induce much energy stress as measured by glycolysis acceleration , ATP imbalance , AMPK activation , AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation at Ser(79) , and cell growth inhibition .	cellular energetics
20110356_s6	In OXPHOS-dependent LKB1 wild type cells , oligomycin induces 5-8% ATP drops and transient AMPK activation during the initial 1-2 h .	
20110356_s7	After AMPK activation is completed , oligomycin-induced increase of acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation at Ser(79) is still detected , and cellular ATP is back at preoligomycin treatment levels by sustained elevation of glycolysis .	cellular energetics
20110356_s8	Cell growth , however , is inhibited without an increase in cell death and alteration in cell cycle distribution .	
20110356_s9	In OXPHOS-dependent LKB1-null cells , no AMPK activation by oligomycin is detected , yet cells still show a similar adaptation .	
20110356_s10	We also demonstrate that the adaptation to oligomycin does not invoke activation of hypoxia-induced factor .	
20110356_s11	Our data suggest that cancer cells may grow and survive persistent OXPHOS suppression through an as yet unidentified regulatory mechanism .	
20111042_s0	It is commonly believed that neurons remain in G(0) phase of the cell cycle indefinitely .	
20111042_s1	Cell-cycle re-entry , however , is known to contribute to neuronal apoptosis .	
20111042_s2	Moreover , recent evidence demonstrates the expression of cell-cycle proteins in differentiated neurons under physiological conditions .	
20111042_s3	The functional roles of such expression remain unclear .	
20111042_s4	Since DNA repair is generally attenuated by differentiation in most cell types , the cell-cycle-associated events in postmitotic cells may reflect the need to re-enter the cell cycle to activate DNA repair .	
20111042_s5	We show that cyclin-C-directed , pRb-dependent G(0) exit activates the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA repair ( NHEJ ) in postmitotic neurons .	genomic instability and mutation
20111042_s6	Using RNA interference , we found that abrogation of cyclin-C-mediated exit from G(0) compromised DNA repair but did not initiate apoptosis .	genomic instability and mutation
20111042_s7	Forced G(1) entry combined with prevention of G(1) --&gt ; S progression triggered NHEJ activation even in the absence of DNA lesions , but did not induce apoptosis in contrast to unrestricted progression through G(1) --&gt ; S. We conclude that G(0) --&gt ; G(1) transition is functionally significant for NHEJ repair in postmitotic neurons .	genomic instability and mutation
20111042_s8	These findings reveal the importance of cell-cycle activation for controlling both DNA repair and apoptosis in postmitotic neurons , and underline the particular role of G(1) --&gt ; S progression in apoptotic signaling , providing new insights into the mechanisms of DNA damage response ( DDR ) in postmitotic neurons .	genomic instability and mutation
20118229_s0	In response to DNA double strand breaks , the histone variant H2AX at the break site is phosphorylated at serine 139 by DNA damage sensor kinases such as ataxia telangiectasia-mutated , forming gamma-H2AX .	
20118229_s1	This phosphorylation event is critical for sustained recruitment of other proteins to repair the break .	
20118229_s2	After repair , restoration of the cell to a prestress state is associated with gamma-H2AX dephosphorylation and dissolution of gamma-H2AX-associated damage foci .	
20118229_s3	The phosphatases PP2A and PP4 have previously been shown to dephosphorylate gamma-H2AX .	
20118229_s4	Here , we demonstrate that the wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 ( WIP1 ) also dephosphorylates gamma-H2AX at serine 139 in vitro and in vivo .	genomic instability and mutation
20118229_s5	Overexpression of WIP1 reduces formation of gamma-H2AX foci in response to ionizing and ultraviolet radiation and blocks recruitment of MDC1 ( mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 ) and 53BP1 ( p53 binding protein 1 ) to DNA damage foci .	genomic instability and mutation
20118229_s6	Finally , these inhibitory effects of WIP1 on gamma-H2AX are accompanied by WIP1 suppression of DNA double strand break repair .	genomic instability and mutation
20118229_s7	Thus , WIP1 has a homeostatic role in reversing the effects of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated phosphorylation of H2AX .	
20118983_s0	The anti-apoptotic protein , BAX inhibitor-1 ( BI-1 ) , has a role in cancer/tumor progression .	
20118983_s1	BI-1-overexpressing HT1080 and B16F10 cells produced higher lung weights and tumor volumes after injection into the tail veins of mice .	
20118983_s2	Transfection of BI-1 siRNA into cells before injection blocked lung metastasis. in vitro , the overexpression of BI-1 increased cell mobility and invasiveness , with highly increased glucose consumption and cytosolic accumulation of lactate and pyruvate , but decreased mitochondrial O(2) consumption and ATP production .	activating invasion and metastasis,cellular energetics
20118983_s3	Glucose metabolism-associated extracellular pH also decreased as cells excreted more H(+) , and sodium hydrogen exchanger ( NHE ) activity increased , probably as a homeostatic mechanism for intracellular pH .	
20118983_s4	These alterations activated MMP 2/9 and cell mobility and invasiveness , which were reversed by the NHE inhibitor , 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride ( EIPA ) , suggesting a role for NHE in cancer metastasis .	
20118983_s5	In both in vitro and in vivo experiments , C-terminal deleted ( CDeltaBI-1 ) cells showed similar results to control cells , suggesting that the C-terminal motif is required for BI-1-associated alterations of glucose metabolism , NHE activation and cancer metastasis .	cellular energetics
20118983_s6	These findings strongly suggest that BI-1 reduces extracellular pH and regulates metastasis by altering glucose metabolism and activating NHE , with the C-terminal tail having a pivotal role in these processes .	activating invasion and metastasis,cellular energetics
20119958_s0	We investigated the mechanisms of DNA exit during single-cell gel electrophoresis ( the comet assay ) by measuring the kinetics of the comet tail formation .	
20119958_s1	In the neutral comet assay , the rate of DNA exit was found to be dependent on the topological state of DNA , which was influenced by either ethidium bromide or a low radiation dose .	
20119958_s2	The results clearly show that the comet tail is formed by extended DNA loops : the loop extension , being reversible when the DNA torsional constraint remains in the loops , is favored when the constraint is relaxed .	genomic instability and mutation
20119958_s3	The kinetics of the comet formation in the case of a high radiation dose points out that accumulation of the single-strand breaks causes DNA fragmentation .	genomic instability and mutation
20119958_s4	In contrast to the neutral comet assay , the alkaline comet assay is not related to the chromatin loops .	genomic instability and mutation
20119958_s5	Our results imply that the alkaline treatment induces detachment of the loops from the nuclear matrix , and the comet tail is formed by ssDNA fragments , the ends of which are pulled out from the comet head by electric force .	genomic instability and mutation
20119958_s6	We suggest that the kinetic approach can be considered as an important improvement of the comet assay .	genomic instability and mutation
20122407_s0	Homologous recombination ( HR ) is essential for repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) .	
20122407_s1	Although the mechanisms of RAD-51-DNA filament assembly and strand exchange are well characterized , the subsequent steps of HR are less well defined .	
20122407_s2	Here , we describe a synthetic lethal interaction between the C. elegans helicase helq-1 and RAD-51 paralog rfs-1 , which results in a block to meiotic DSB repair after strand invasion .	genomic instability and mutation
20122407_s3	Whereas RAD-51-ssDNA filaments assemble at meiotic DSBs with normal kinetics in helq-1 , rfs-1 double mutants , persistence of RAD-51 foci and genetic interactions with rtel-1 suggest a failure to disassemble RAD-51 from strand invasion intermediates .	genomic instability and mutation
20122407_s4	Indeed , purified HELQ-1 and RFS-1 independently bind to and promote the disassembly of RAD-51 from double-stranded , but not single-stranded , DNA filaments via distinct mechanisms in vitro .	
20122407_s5	These results indicate that two compensating activities are required to promote postsynaptic RAD-51 filament disassembly , which are collectively essential for completion of meiotic DSB repair .	genomic instability and mutation
20123696_s0	Diphenyl ditelluride ( DPDT ) is a potential prototype for the development of novel biologically active molecules .	
20123696_s1	Thus , it is important to evaluate the toxic effects of this compound .	
20123696_s2	In the present study , we evaluated the cytotoxic , genotoxic and mutagenic properties of DPDT in Chinese hamster fibroblast ( V79 ) cells , in strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae both proficient and deficient in several DNA repair pathways and in Salmonella typhimurium .	
20123696_s3	DPDT induced frameshift mutations in both S.typhimurium and a haploid wild-type strain of S.cerevisiae .	
20123696_s4	Mutants of S.cerevisiae defective in base excision repair and recombinational repair were more sensitive to DPDT .	
20123696_s5	The results of a lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay suggest that DPDT is cytotoxic to V79 cells .	
20123696_s6	At cytotoxic concentrations , this compound increased thiobarbituric reactive species levels and decreased the glutathione:GSSH ratio in yeast and V79 cells .	
20123696_s7	DPDT generated single- and double-strand DNA breaks in V79 cells , both with and without metabolic activation , as revealed by alkaline and neutral comet assays .	genomic instability and mutation
20123696_s8	Moreover , an induction of oxidative DNA base damage was indicated by a modified comet assay using formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase and endonuclease III .	genomic instability and mutation
20123696_s9	Treatment with DPDT also induced micronucleus formation in V79 cells .	
20123696_s10	Pre-incubation with N-acetylcysteine reduced DPDT's oxidative , genotoxic and mutagenic effects in yeast and V79 cells .	genomic instability and mutation
20123696_s11	Our results suggest that the toxic and mutagenic properties of DPDT may stem from its ability to disturb the redox balance of the cell , which leads to oxidative stress and the induction of DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
20126263_s0	DNA damage checkpoints arrest cell cycle progression to facilitate DNA repair .	
20126263_s1	The ability to survive genotoxic insults depends not only on the initiation of cell cycle checkpoints but also on checkpoint maintenance .	
20126263_s2	While activation of DNA damage checkpoints has been studied extensively , molecular mechanisms involved in sustaining and ultimately inactivating cell cycle checkpoints are largely unknown .	
20126263_s3	Here , we explored feedback mechanisms that control the maintenance and termination of checkpoint function by computationally identifying an evolutionary conserved mitotic phosphorylation network within the DNA damage response .	
20126263_s4	We demonstrate that the non-enzymatic checkpoint adaptor protein 53BP1 is an in vivo target of the cell cycle kinases Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 and Polo-like kinase-1 ( Plk1 ) .	
20126263_s5	We show that Plk1 binds 53BP1 during mitosis and that this interaction is required for proper inactivation of the DNA damage checkpoint. 53BP1 mutants that are unable to bind Plk1 fail to restart the cell cycle after ionizing radiation-mediated cell cycle arrest .	
20126263_s6	Importantly , we show that Plk1 also phosphorylates the 53BP1-binding checkpoint kinase Chk2 to inactivate its FHA domain and inhibit its kinase activity in mammalian cells .	evading growth suppressors
20126263_s7	Thus , a mitotic kinase-mediated negative feedback loop regulates the ATM-Chk2 branch of the DNA damage signaling network by phosphorylating conserved sites in 53BP1 and Chk2 to inactivate checkpoint signaling and control checkpoint duration .	evading growth suppressors
20133803_s0	Class switch recombination ( CSR ) in B lymphocytes is initiated by introduction of multiple DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) into switch ( S ) regions that flank immunoglobulin heavy chain ( IgH ) constant region exons .	
20133803_s1	CSR is completed by joining a DSB in the donor S mu to a DSB in a downstream acceptor S region ( e.g. , S gamma1 ) by end-joining .	
20133803_s2	In normal cells , many CSR junctions are mediated by classical nonhomologous end-joining ( C-NHEJ ) , which employs the Ku70/80 complex for DSB recognition and XRCC4/DNA ligase 4 for ligation .	
20133803_s3	Alternative end-joining ( A-EJ ) mediates CSR , at reduced levels , in the absence of C-NHEJ , even in combined absence of Ku70 and ligase 4 , demonstrating an A-EJ pathway totally distinct from C-NHEJ .	
20133803_s4	Multiple DSBs are introduced into S mu during CSR , with some being rejoined or joined to each other to generate internal switch deletions ( ISDs ) .	
20133803_s5	In addition , S-region DSBs can be joined to other chromosomes to generate translocations , the level of which is increased by absence of a single C-NHEJ component ( e.g. , XRCC4 ) .	
20133803_s6	We asked whether ISD and S-region translocations occur in the complete absence of C-NHEJ ( e.g. , in Ku70/ligase 4 double-deficient B cells ) .	
20133803_s7	We found , unexpectedly , that B-cell activation for CSR generates substantial ISD in both S mu and S gamma1 and that ISD in both is greatly increased by the absence of C-NHEJ .	genomic instability and mutation
20133803_s8	IgH chromosomal translocations to the c-myc oncogene also are augmented in the combined absence of Ku70 and ligase 4 .	
20133803_s9	We discuss the implications of these findings for A-EJ in normal and abnormal DSB repair .	genomic instability and mutation
20133837_s0	Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose by aerobic glycolysis , characterized by increased lactate production .	
20133837_s1	This distinctive metabolism involves expression of the embryonic M2 isozyme of pyruvate kinase , in contrast to the M1 isozyme normally expressed in differentiated cells , and it confers a proliferative advantage to tumor cells .	
20133837_s2	The M1 and M2 pyruvate-kinase isozymes are expressed from a single gene through alternative splicing of a pair of mutually exclusive exons .	
20133837_s3	We measured the expression of M1 and M2 mRNA and protein isoforms in mouse tissues , tumor cell lines , and during terminal differentiation of muscle cells , and show that alternative splicing regulation is sufficient to account for the levels of expressed protein isoforms .	
20133837_s4	We further show that the M1-specific exon is actively repressed in cancer-cell lines--although some M1 mRNA is expressed in cell lines derived from brain tumors--and demonstrate that the related splicing repressors hnRNP A1 and A2 , as well as the polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein PTB , contribute to this control .	
20133837_s5	Downregulation of these splicing repressors in cancer-cell lines using shRNAs rescues M1 isoform expression and decreases the extent of lactate production .	
20133837_s6	These findings extend the links between alternative splicing and cancer , and begin to define some of the factors responsible for the switch to aerobic glycolysis .	cellular energetics
20140245_s0	Aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction are common features of aggressive cancer growth .	
20140245_s1	We observed promoter methylation and loss of expression in neurofilament heavy polypeptide ( NEFH ) in a significant proportion of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) samples that were of a high tumor grade and advanced stage .	
20140245_s2	RNA interference-mediated knockdown of NEFH accelerated ESCC cell growth in culture and increased tumorigenicity in vivo , whereas forced expression of NEFH significantly inhibited cell growth and colony formation .	
20140245_s3	Loss of NEFH caused up-regulation of pyruvate kinase-M2 type and down-regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase , via activation of the Akt/beta-catenin pathway , resulting in enhanced aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction .	cellular energetics
20140245_s4	The acceleration of glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction in NEFH-knockdown cells was suppressed in the absence of beta-catenin expression , and was decreased by the treatment of 2-Deoxyglucose , a glycolytic inhibitor , or API-2 , an Akt inhibitor .	cellular energetics
20140245_s5	Loss of NEFH activates the Akt/beta-catenin pathway and increases glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction .	cellular energetics
20140245_s6	Cancer cells with methylated NEFH can be targeted for destruction with specific inhibitors of deregulated downstream pathways .	cellular energetics
20145304_s0	The relationship between DNA damage and repair of peripheral blood leukocytes , liver , kidney and brain cells was investigated in Swiss albino mice ( Mus musculus L. ) after exposure to sevoflurane ( 2.4 vol% for 2 h daily , for 3 days ) .	
20145304_s1	Genetic damage of mouse cells was investigated by the comet assay and micronucleus test .	
20145304_s2	To perform the comet assay , mice were divided into a control group and 4 groups of exposed mice sacrificed on day 3 of the experiment , at 0 , 2 , 6 or 24 h after the last exposure to sevoflurane .	
20145304_s3	Mean tail length ( TL ) , tail moment ( TM ) , and tail intensity ( TI ) values were significantly higher in exposed mice ( all examined organs ) than in the control group .	
20145304_s4	Significant DNA damage immediately after exposure to sevoflurane was observed in leukocytes .	genomic instability and mutation
20145304_s5	Damage induction in the liver , kidney , and brain occurred 6 h later than in leukocytes , as expected according to the toxicokinetics of the drug , where blood is the first compartment to absorb sevoflurane .	
20145304_s6	However , none of the tested tissues revealed signs of repair until 24 h after the exposure .	genomic instability and mutation
20145304_s7	To distinguish the unrepaired genome damage in vivo , the micronucleus test was applied .	
20145304_s8	Number of micronuclei in reticulocytes showed a statistically significant increase , as compared with the control group at all observed times after the treatment .	
20147338_s0	Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) arises as the consequence of progressive changes from normal epithelial cells through polyp to tumor , and thus is an useful model for studying metabolic shift .	
20147338_s1	In the present study , we studied the metabolomic profiles using high analyte specific gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ( GC/MS ) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC/MS/MS ) to attain a systems-level view of the shift in metabolism in cells progressing along the path to CRC .	
20147338_s2	Colonic tissues including tumor , polyps and adjacent matched normal mucosa from 26 patients with sporadic CRC from freshly isolated resections were used for this study .	
20147338_s3	The metabolic profiles were obtained using GC/MS and LC/MS/MS .	
20147338_s4	Our data suggest there was a distinct profile change of a wide range of metabolites from mucosa to tumor tissues .	
20147338_s5	Various amino acids and lipids in the polyps and tumors were elevated , suggesting higher energy needs for increased cellular proliferation .	
20147338_s6	In contrast , significant depletion of glucose and inositol in polyps revealed that glycolysis may be critical in early tumorigenesis .	cellular energetics
20147338_s7	In addition , the accumulation of hypoxanthine and xanthine , and the decrease of uric acid concentration , suggest that the purine biosynthesis pathway could have been substituted by the salvage pathway in CRC .	
20147338_s8	Further , there was a step-wise reduction of deoxycholic acid concentration from mucosa to tumors .	
20147338_s9	It appears that to gain a growth advantage , cancer cells may adopt alternate metabolic pathways in tumorigenesis and this flexibility allows them to adapt and thrive in harsh environment .	
20150366_s0	Although the etiology of primary brain tumors is largely unknown , prior studies suggest that DNA repair polymorphisms may influence risk of glioma .	
20150366_s1	Altered DNA repair is also likely to affect the risk of meningioma and acoustic neuroma , but these tumors have not been well studied .	
20150366_s2	We estimated the risk of glioma ( n = 362 ) , meningioma ( n = 134 ) , and acoustic neuroma ( n = 69 ) in non-Hispanic whites with respect to 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 26 genes involved in DNA repair in a hospital-based , case-control study conducted by the National Cancer Institute .	genomic instability and mutation
20150366_s3	We observed significantly increased risk of meningioma with the T variant of GLTSCR1 rs1035938 ( OR(CT/TT) = 3.5 ; 95% confidence interval : 1.8-6.9 ; P(trend) .0006 ) , which persisted after controlling for multiple comparisons ( P = .019 ) .	
20150366_s4	Significantly increased meningioma risk was also observed for the minor allele variants of ERCC4 rs1800067 ( P(trend) .01 ) ; MUTYH rs3219466 ( P(trend) .02 ) , and PCNA rs25406 ( P(trend) .03 ) .	
20150366_s5	The NBN rs1805794 minor allele variant was associated with decreased meningioma risk ( P(trend) .006 ) .	
20150366_s6	Risk of acoustic neuroma was increased for the ERCC2 rs1799793 ( P(trend) .03 ) and ERCC5 rs17655 ( P(trend) .05 ) variants and decreased for the PARP1 rs1136410 ( P(trend) .03 ) .	
20150366_s7	Decreased glioma risk was observed with the XRCC1 rs1799782 variant ( P(trend) .04 ) .	
20150366_s8	Our results suggest that common DNA repair variants may affect the risk of adult brain tumors , especially meningioma .	genomic instability and mutation
20154721_s0	The neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) tumor suppressor gene encodes merlin , a membrane/cytoskeleton protein necessary for the maintenance of contact inhibition of growth in cells .	
20154721_s1	Bi-allelic inactivation of NF2 is known to cause multiple cancers in both humans and mice .	
20154721_s2	However , the mechanism through which merlin exerts its tumor-suppressive function remains obscure .	
20154721_s3	In this report , we show that NF2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts lost contact inhibition of cell proliferation and contained significantly increased canonical Wnt signaling .	evading growth suppressors
20154721_s4	Inhibition of Rac1 , the activity of which is inversely regulated by NF2 , through the use of a dominant-negative mutant , small hairpin RNA or a small molecule inhibitor in NF2-deficient cells , was able to suppress elevated Wnt signals as shown by reduced activity of the T-cell factor 4 ( TCF4 ) transcription factor .	
20154721_s5	Dominant-negative TCF4 or Rac1 mutant , as well as a small molecule inhibition of Wnt , were able to curb NF2 deficiency-elicited cell proliferation at the confluent state .	
20154721_s6	Thus , Rac1-mediated canonical Wnt signaling is essential for the loss of contact inhibition in NF2-deficient cells .	evading growth suppressors
20156803_s0	The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K)/Akt oncogenic pathway is critical in glioblastomas .	
20156803_s1	Loss of PTEN , a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway or activated PI3K/Akt pathway that drive increased proliferation , survival , neovascularization , glycolysis , and invasion is found in 70%-80% of malignant gliomas .	
20156803_s2	Thus , PI3K is an attractive therapeutic target for malignant glioma .	
20156803_s3	We report that a new irreversible PI3K inhibitor , PX-866 , shows potent inhibitory effects on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in glioblastoma .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20156803_s4	PX-866 did not induce any apoptosis in glioma cells ; however , an increase in autophagy was observed .	resisting cell death
20156803_s5	PX-866 inhibited the invasive and angiogenic capabilities of cultured glioblastoma cells .	
20156803_s6	In vivo , PX-866 inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth and increased the median survival time of animals with intracranial tumors .	
20156803_s7	We also assessed the potential of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) as a noninvasive method to monitor response to PX-866 .	
20156803_s8	Our findings show that PX-866 treatment causes a drop in the MRS-detectable choline-to-NAA , ratio and identify this partial normalization of the tumor metabolic profile as a biomarker of molecular drug action .	
20156803_s9	Our studies affirm that the PI3K pathway is a highly specific molecular target for therapies for glioblastoma and other cancers with aberrant PI3K/PTEN expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20160030_s0	Overexpression of the adverse prognostic marker ERBB2 occurs in 30% of breast cancers ; however , therapies targeting this gene have not proved to be as effective as was initially hoped .	
20160030_s1	Transcriptional profiling meta-analyses have shown that there are approximately 150 genes co-overexpressed with ERBB2 , suggesting that these genes may represent alternative factors influencing ERBB2-positive tumors .	
20160030_s2	Here we describe an RNA interference-based analysis of these genes that identifies transcriptional regulators of fat synthesis and storage as being critical for the survival of these cells .	
20160030_s3	These transcription factors , nuclear receptor subfamily 1 , group D , member 1 ( NR1D1 ) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma binding protein ( PBP ) , both reside on ERBB2-containing 17q12-21 amplicons and are part of the ERBB2 expression signature .	
20160030_s4	We show that NR1D1 and PBP act through a common pathway in upregulating several genes in the de novo fatty acid synthesis network , which is highly active in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells .	
20160030_s5	Malate dehydrogenase 1 and malic enzyme 1 , enzymes that link glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis , are also regulated by NR1D1 .	
20160030_s6	The resulting high-level fat production from increased expression of these genes likely contributes to an abnormal cellular energy metabolism based on aerobic glycolysis .	cellular energetics
20160030_s7	Together , these results show that the cells of this aggressive form of breast cancer are genetically preprogrammed to depend on NR1D1 and PBP for the energy production necessary for survival .	
20160076_s0	Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) is a cellular damage sensor that coordinates the cell cycle with damage-response checkpoints and DNA repair to preserve genomic integrity .	
20160076_s1	However , ATM also has been implicated in metabolic regulation , and ATM deficiency is associated with elevated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .	
20160076_s2	ROS has a central role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes including inflammation and chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer , underscoring the importance of cellular pathways involved in redox homeostasis .	
20160076_s3	We have identified a cytoplasmic function for ATM that participates in the cellular damage response to ROS .	
20160076_s4	We show that in response to elevated ROS , ATM activates the TSC2 tumor suppressor via the LKB1/AMPK metabolic pathway in the cytoplasm to repress mTORC1 and induce autophagy .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20160076_s5	Importantly , elevated ROS and dysregulation of mTORC1 in ATM-deficient cells is inhibited by rapamycin , which also rescues lymphomagenesis in Atm-deficient mice .	
20160076_s6	Our results identify a cytoplasmic pathway for ROS-induced ATM activation of TSC2 to regulate mTORC1 signaling and autophagy , identifying an integration node for the cellular damage response with key pathways involved in metabolism , protein synthesis , and cell survival .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20167975_s0	BACKGROUND &amp ; OBJECTIVE Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC or Lynch syndrome ) , is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that is believed to account for 2-10 per cent of all the colorectal cancer cases .	
20167975_s1	The disease follows autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with high penetrance ( 85% ) and younger age of onset when compared to patients with sporadic tumours .	
20167975_s2	HNPCC is associated with germ-line mutations in the DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) genes namely MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , and PMS2 .	
20167975_s3	The present study was aimed at analyzing mismatch repair gene(s) in an extended Indian family satisfying the Amsterdam criteria , and extending the analysis to general population to estimate frequency of the mutations/polymorphisms observed .	
20167975_s4	METHODS A total 12 members of the HNPCC family were studied for genetic investigation .	
20167975_s5	Ethnically matched 250 normal individuals were also included as controls to study the observed mutations/polymorphisms at population level .	
20167975_s6	RESULTS The analysis resulted in identification of a 1975C&gt;T mutation in exon 17 , resulting in substitution of arginine residue with stop codon at codon 659. 655A&gt;G substitution was also observed , resulting in replacement of isoleucine with valine at codon 219 .	genomic instability and mutation
20167975_s7	Similar analysis on 250 ethnically matched control subjects revealed complete absence of R659X mutation , while I219V variant was found in 9.8 per cent of the controls .	genomic instability and mutation
20167975_s8	INTERPRETATION &amp ; CONCLUSION R659X mutation correlates with disease phenotype , and 655A&gt;G locus is highly polymorphic .	
20167975_s9	Our study suggested that R659X substitution was prime cause for the disease phenotype in this family .	
20167975_s10	I219V substitution is a polymorphism having no association with the disease onset or segregation .	
20167975_s11	The family members harbouring this mutation were advised to be under regular medical surveillance .	
20184723_s0	BACKGROUND Lung cancer often develops in association with chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases with an influx of neutrophils .	
20184723_s1	More detailed information on inflammatory pathways and the role of neutrophils herein is a prerequisite for understanding the mechanism of inflammation associated cancer .	
20184723_s2	METHODS In the present study , we used microarrays in order to obtain a global view of the transcriptional responses of the lung to LPS in mice , which mimics an acute lung inflammation .	
20184723_s3	To investigate the influence of neutrophils in this process , we depleted mice from circulating neutrophils by treatment with anti-PMN antibodies prior to LPS exposure .	
20184723_s4	RESULTS A total of 514 genes was greater than 1.5-fold differentially expressed in the LPS induced lung inflammation model. 394 of the 514 were up regulated genes mostly involved in cell cycle and immune/inflammation related processes , such as cytokine/chemokine activity and signalling .	tumor promoting inflammation
20184723_s5	Down regulated genes represented nonimmune processes , such as development , metabolism and transport .	
20184723_s6	Notably , the number of genes and pathways that were differentially expressed , was reduced when animals were depleted from circulating neutrophils , confirming the central role of neutrophils in the inflammatory response .	tumor promoting inflammation
20184723_s7	Furthermore , there was a significant correlation between the differentially expressed gene list and the promutagenic DNA lesion M1dG , suggesting that it is the extent of the immune response which drives genetic instability in the inflamed lung .	tumor promoting inflammation
20184723_s8	Several genes that were specifically regulated by the presence of activated neutrophils could be identified and these were mostly involved in interferon signalling , oxidative stress response and cell cycle progression .	tumor promoting inflammation
20184723_s9	The latter possibly refers to a higher rate of cell turnover in the inflamed lung with neutrophils , suggesting that the neutrophil influx is associated with a higher risk for the accumulation and fixation of mutations .	genomic instability and mutation
20184723_s10	CONCLUSION Gene expression profiling identified specific genes and pathways that are related to neutrophilic inflammation and could be associated to cancer development and indicate an active role of neutrophils in mediating the LPS induced inflammatory response in the mouse lung .	tumor promoting inflammation
20185912_s0	AIM Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer in the industrial countries .	
20185912_s1	Due to advances regarding the treatments , primarily development of improved surgical methods and the ability to make the earlier diagnosis , the mortality has remained constant during the past decades even though the incidence in fact has increased .	
20185912_s2	To improve chemotherapy and enable personalised treatment , the need of biomarkers is of great significance .	
20185912_s3	In this study , we evaluated the gene expression profiles of the colon cancer cell lines treated with SN-38 , the active metabolite of topoisomerase-1 inhibitor irinotecan which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis .	
20185912_s4	MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 3 colon cancer cell lines : KM12C , KM12SM and KM12l4a .	
20185912_s5	The 3 cell lines were treated with SN-38 , and samples were obtained after 24 and 48 hour treatments .	
20185912_s6	The gene expression analyses were performed using oligonucleotide microarrays comprising of approximately 27,000 spots where the untreated controls were compared to the SN-38-treated samples .	
20185912_s7	RESULTS Unsupervised clustering clearly distinguished the treated cell lines from the untreated .	
20185912_s8	Supervised analysis identified 3,974 significant genes ( p = 0.05 ) differentiating the treated samples from the untreated , majority of which were down-regulated after treatment .	
20185912_s9	The top-ranked down-regulated genes in the treated cell lines included those related to receptor and kinase activity , signal transduction , apoptosis , RNA processing , protein metabolism and transport , cell cycle and transcription .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20185912_s10	A smaller number of genes were up-regulated in the cell lines after treatment and included genes involved in apoptosis , transcription , development and differentiation .	
20185912_s11	CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that the expression of the genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as RNA , DNA and protein metabolism were affected by SN-38 .	
20185912_s12	The impact of certain genes on colorectal cancer development needs to be further evaluated ; however , these results could serve as a basis for further studies in order to find targets for irinotecan treatment .	
20187579_s0	Hypoxia is widespread in solid tumors as a consequence of poorly structured tumor-derived neovasculature , which is recognized to play a role in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy .	
20187579_s1	Etoposide ( VP-16 ) , a drug commonly used in chemotherapy , leads to enhanced accumulation of cell populations in G2/M phase and increases levels of apoptosis as a topoisomerase II inhibitor .	
20187579_s2	We evaluated the effects of hypoxia on the response of the neuroblastoma cell line CHP126 to VP-16 , in order to delineate the mechanisms responsible for the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance of this clinically conventional anti-cancer agent , with an insight to determining potential indications in neuroblastoma therapy .	
20187579_s3	In this study , physiological hypoxia was shown to attenuate G2/M arrest and apoptosis induced in CHP126 cells by VP-16 .	
20187579_s4	It suppressed drug-related Cdk1 activity with a less elevation of regulator proteins such as cyclin B1 , Cdk7 and reduced caspase activation and PARP cleavage compared to the efficiency observed in normoxic condition , which were significantly relative with hypoxia-driven inhibition of p53 and p-ERK1/2 activation .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20187579_s5	These results clearly demonstrated that hypoxia had a protective effect against VP-16-induced cytotoxicity , which is likely to provide a further therapeutic knowledge in neuroblastomas .	
20190398_s0	The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates a spectrum of toxic and biological effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related compounds .	
20190398_s1	Several reports have shown that the AhR plays an important role in the control of cell-cycle progression , and this function is thought to be partly associated with the tumor promotion activity of dioxin .	
20190398_s2	However , the underling mechanisms are not fully understood .	
20190398_s3	We have previously shown that overexpression of AhR , as well as AhR ligand treatment , stimulates cell proliferation of human lung cancer A549 cells .	
20190398_s4	In AhR-activated cells , the expression levels of DNA synthesis-related genes such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) and RFC38 are notably increased .	
20190398_s5	Expression of these genes is mainly regulated by E2F1 , a transcription factor that is crucial for transition of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase .	
20190398_s6	We show here that the transcriptional activity of E2F1 is increased by the AhR agonist treatment and that this effect depends on the presence of AhR .	
20190398_s7	Functional mapping of AhR showed that the Per-Arnt-Sim ( PAS ) B domain is required for promotion of E2F1 activity .	
20190398_s8	The mechanism involves formation of a complex of AhR and E2F1 on the regulatory region in the E2F1 target gene , followed by recruitment of coactivator activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors ( ACTR ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20190398_s9	Consequently , the results in this study indicate the physiological function of AhR as a potent transcriptional coactivator of E2F1-dependent transcription and implicate the AhR-E2F1 interaction as a part of the mechanism by which AhR/Arnt promotes cell proliferation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20190402_s0	Although anticancer effect of gambogic acid ( GA ) and its potential mechanisms were well documented in past decades , limited information is available on the anticancer effect of gambogenic acid ( GNA ) , another major active component of Gamboge .	
20190402_s1	Here we performed a study to determine whether GNA possesses anticancer effect and find its potential mechanisms .	
20190402_s2	The results suggested that GNA significantly inhibited the proliferation of several tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo .	
20190402_s3	Treatment with GNA dose and time dependently induced A549 cells apoptosis , arrested the cells to G0/G1 phase in vitro and down-regulated the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclooxygenase ( COX)-2 in mRNA level .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling,tumor promoting inflammation
20190402_s4	In addition , anticancer effect was further demonstrated by applying xenografts in nude mice coupled with the characteristic of apoptosis in the GNA treated group .	
20190402_s5	Taken together , these observations might suggest that GNA inhibits tumor cell proliferation via apoptosis-induction and cell cycle arrest .	
20190804_s0	Cancer cells upregulate glycolysis , increasing glucose uptake to meet energy needs .	
20190804_s1	A small fraction of a cell's glucose enters the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway ( HBP ) , which regulates levels of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine ( O-GlcNAc ) , a carbohydrate posttranslational modification of diverse nuclear and cytosolic proteins .	
20190804_s2	We discovered that breast cancer cells upregulate the HBP , including increased O-GlcNAcation and elevated expression of O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT ) , which is the enzyme catalyzing the addition of O-GlcNAc to proteins .	
20190804_s3	Reduction of O-GlcNAcation through RNA interference of OGT in breast cancer cells leads to inhibition of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo and is associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and increased expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) .	evading growth suppressors
20190804_s4	Elevation of p27(Kip1) was associated with decreased expression and activity of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 , a known regulator of p27(Kip1) stability through transcriptional control of Skp2 .	evading growth suppressors
20190804_s5	Reducing O-GlcNAc levels in breast cancer cells decreased levels of FoxM1 protein and caused a decrease in multiple FoxM1-specific targets , including Skp2 .	
20190804_s6	Moreover , reducing O-GlcNAcation decreased cancer cell invasion and was associated with the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 , a known FoxM1 target .	
20190804_s7	Finally , pharmacological inhibition of OGT in breast cancer cells had similar anti-growth and anti-invasion effects .	
20190804_s8	These findings identify O-GlcNAc as a novel mechanism through which alterations in glucose metabolism regulate cancer growth and invasion and suggest that OGT may represent novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer .	cellular energetics
20197645_s0	Ataxia telangiectasia ( AT ) cells , with their defective double-strand break ( DSB ) repair processes , exhibit high sensitivity to low-LET radiation such as X-rays irradiation and gamma beams .	
20197645_s1	Since heavy ion beam treatment for cancer is becoming increasingly common in Japan and elsewhere , it is important to also determine their sensitivity to high-LET radiation .	
20197645_s2	For this purpose we irradiated AT and normal human cells immortalized with the human telomerase gene using high- ( 24-60 keV/microm carbon and 200 keV/microm iron ions ) or low-LET ( X-rays ) radiation in non-proliferative conditions .	
20197645_s3	In normal cells the RBE ( relative biological effectiveness ) of carbon and iron ions increased from 1.19 to 1.81 in proportion to LET .	
20197645_s4	In contrast , their RBE in AT cells increased from 1.32 at 24 keV/microm to 1.59 at 40 keV/microm , and exhibited a plateau at over 40 keV/microm .	
20197645_s5	In normal cells most gamma-H2AX foci induced by both carbon- and iron-ion beams had disappeared at 40 h .	
20197645_s6	In AT cells , however , a significant number of gamma-H2AX foci were still observed at 40 h .	genomic instability and mutation
20197645_s7	The RBEs found in the AT cells after heavy-ion irradiation were consistent with the effects predicted from the presence of non-homologous end joining defects .	genomic instability and mutation
20197645_s8	The DSBs remaining after heavy-ion irradiation suggested defects in the AT cells ' DSB repair ability .	genomic instability and mutation
20200432_s0	Previous epidemiologic observational and experimental studies investigated the potential of antioxidant micronutrients to modulate cancer risk , but these studies produced inconsistent results .	
20200432_s1	In this pilot , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial ( n = 47 ) , we assessed the effects of an antioxidant micronutrient combination ( 800 mg dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate , 24 mg beta-carotene , 1.0 g vitamin C , 200 microg l-selenomethionine , 7.2 mg riboflavin , 80 mg niacin , 60 mg zinc , 5 mg manganese ) given daily over 4 months on oxidative and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with a history of sporadic colorectal adenoma .	
20200432_s2	Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , interleukin-6 , and F2-isoprostane concentrations were measured using ELISAs , and cystine ( CySS ) was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography .	
20200432_s3	Plasma TNF-alpha concentration decreased in the active treatment group by 37% relative to the placebo group ( P = 0.002 ) , and CySS decreased by 19% ( P = 0.03 ) ; however , interleukin-6 and F2-isoprostane concentrations decreased in antioxidant-treated nonsmokers but increased in smokers , although these findings were not statistically significant .	
20200432_s4	The decreases of TNF-alpha and CySS were more pronounced in nonsmokers .	
20200432_s5	These data suggest that ( a ) an antioxidant micronutrient cocktail can modulate biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in humans and ( b ) the effects of antioxidant micronutrient supplementation on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress may differ according to smoking status .	tumor promoting inflammation
20200484_s0	The tumor suppressor p27(Kip1) is an inhibitor of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) complexes and plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation .	
20200484_s1	Nevertheless , p27 function in the tumorigenesis of the uterine cervix has been poorly defined .	
20200484_s2	Some phenomenon hints that HPV E7 protein can enhance p27 expression , which is contradictory to HPV E7's property of increasing cell proliferation rate .	
20200484_s3	So , in the present study , we have examined the effect of E7 on p27 expression .	
20200484_s4	Though the levels of p27 are increased after HPV E7 expression , most of the p27 protein localized in the cytoplasm and have no function on cell cycle arrest and contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
20200484_s5	The cell migration rate is elevated when p27 is high expression and located in cytoplasm .	
20200484_s6	The results indicated that E7-p27 interaction not only abolished the p27's cell cycle inhibitory function by sequestering it to the cytoplasm , but also endow the cell with invasive property which is the feature of malignant cells .	evading growth suppressors
20204363_s0	Bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax is a rare occurrence in patients with both primary and metastatic lung cancer .	
20204363_s1	Pneumothorax occurring as a complication of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) inhibitor therapy has not been previously described in the medical literature .	
20204363_s2	Sunitinib malate is a VEGFR inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma .	
20204363_s3	We present a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma manifested as bilateral pulmonary nodules who developed a bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax 3 weeks after initiation of sunitinib therapy .	
20204363_s4	We believe that sunitinib therapy resulted in necrosis of multiple pleural-based pulmonary nodules with central cavernization and ultimately rupture with bronchopleural fistula formation .	resisting cell death
20204363_s5	Based on this experience , we advise that practitioners exercise caution when prescribing anti-VEGFR therapy in patients with pleural-based pulmonary metastases and recognize that the efficacy and toxicity of these agents may be closely linked .	
20205718_s0	INTRODUCTION Various agents used in breast cancer chemotherapy provoke DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) .	
20205718_s1	DSB repair competence determines the sensitivity of cells to these agents whereby aberrations in the repair machinery leads to apoptosis .	
20205718_s2	Proteins required for this pathway can be detected as nuclear foci at sites of DNA damage when the pathway is intact .	
20205718_s3	Here we investigate whether focus formation of repair proteins can predict chemosensitivity of breast cancer .	
20205718_s4	METHODS Core needle biopsy specimens were obtained from sixty cases of primary breast cancer before and 18-24 hours after the first cycle of neoadjuvant epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide ( EC ) treatment .	
20205718_s5	Nuclear focus formation of DNA damage repair proteins was immunohistochemically analyzed and compared with tumor response to chemotherapy .	
20205718_s6	RESULTS EC treatment induced nuclear foci of gammaH2AX , conjugated ubiquitin , and Rad51 in a substantial amount of cases .	genomic instability and mutation
20205718_s7	In contrast , BRCA1 foci were observed before treatment in the majority of the cases and only decreased after EC in thirteen cases .	
20205718_s8	The presence of BRCA1- , gammaH2AX- , or Rad51-foci before treatment or the presence of Rad51-foci after treatment was inversely correlated with tumor response to chemotherapy .	
20205718_s9	DNA damage response ( DDR ) competence was further evaluated by considering all four repair indicators together .	
20205718_s10	A high DDR score significantly correlated with low tumor response to EC and EC + docetaxel whereas other clinicopathological factors analyzed did not .	
20205718_s11	CONCLUSIONS High performing DDR focus formation resulted in tumor resistance to DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy .	
20205718_s12	Our results suggested an importance of evaluation of DDR competence to predict breast cancer chemosensitivity , and merits further studying into its usefulness in exclusion of non-responder patients .	
20205737_s0	BACKGROUND Astaxanthin modulates immune response , inhibits cancer cell growth , reduces bacterial load and gastric inflammation , and protects against UVA-induced oxidative stress in in vitro and rodent models .	
20205737_s1	Similar clinical studies in humans are unavailable .	
20205737_s2	Our objective is to study the action of dietary astaxanthin in modulating immune response , oxidative status and inflammation in young healthy adult female human subjects .	
20205737_s3	METHODS Participants ( averaged 21.5 yr ) received 0 , 2 , or 8 mg astaxanthin ( n = 14/diet ) daily for 8 wk in a randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled study .	
20205737_s4	Immune response was assessed on wk 0 , 4 and 8 , and tuberculin test performed on wk 8 .	
20205737_s5	RESULTS Plasma astaxanthin increased ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) dose-dependently after 4 or 8 wk of supplementation .	
20205737_s6	Astaxanthin decreased a DNA damage biomarker after 4 wk but did not affect lipid peroxidation .	genomic instability and mutation
20205737_s7	Plasma C-reactive protein concentration was lower ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) on wk 8 in subjects given 2 mg astaxanthin .	tumor promoting inflammation
20205737_s8	Dietary astaxanthin stimulated mitogen-induced lymphoproliferation , increased natural killer cell cytotoxic activity , and increased total T and B cell subpopulations , but did not influence populations of Thelper , Tcytotoxic or natural killer cells .	
20205737_s9	A higher percentage of leukocytes expressed the LFA-1 marker in subjects given 2 mg astaxanthin on wk 8 .	
20205737_s10	Subjects fed 2 mg astaxanthin had a higher tuberculin response than unsupplemented subjects .	
20205737_s11	There was no difference in TNF and IL-2 concentrations , but plasma IFN-gamma and IL-6 increased on wk 8 in subjects given 8 mg astaxanthin .	
20205737_s12	CONCLUSION Therefore , dietary astaxanthin decreases a DNA damage biomarker and acute phase protein , and enhances immune response in young healthy females .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
20208138_s0	BACKGROUND The pTalpha/preTCR regulates the beta-selection , a crucial T-cell developmental checkpoint , providing a most potent survival advantage to thymocytes mediated by the src-kinase p56(Lck) .	
20208138_s1	METHODS To define the relevance of pTalpha in human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) , we analyzed in T-ALL cell lines ( n=14 ) pTalpha and p56(Lck) mRNA and protein expression as also the tyrosine-phosphorylation .	
20208138_s2	The p56(Lck) specific src-protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( PTK-I ) PP1 was used in growth inhibition assays .	
20208138_s3	IC(50) value determination , cell cycle- and apoptosis analyses were performed in T-ALL- , non-T-ALL- and murine transgenic cell lines .	
20208138_s4	RESULTS pTalpha expression patterns were markedly different in T-ALL cell lines as compared to those reported for normal lymphoid counterparts .	
20208138_s5	PP1 induced in 6/11 T-ALL cell lines a survival disadvantage resulting from a cell cycle arrest in the G(1/0) phase in thymic lymphoblastic cells and apoptosis induction in the immature cell line HSB-2 , respectively .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20208138_s6	PP1 sensitive cell lines expressed the target protein p56(Lck) and showed a corresponding P-Tyr signal .	
20208138_s7	CONCLUSION Sensitivity of thymic T-ALLs to PP1 clearly underlines the impact of pTalpha mediated proliferation in this leukemic sub-type .	
20208138_s8	In addition , p56(Lck) represents also independently of pTalpha a promising therapeutical target for the src-kinase inhibitors in neoplastic lymphoid diseases .	
20208355_s0	Prostate cancer ( PCA ) is the most common invasive malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in males .	
20208355_s1	The present study investigated the effects of fangchinoline ( Fan ) , an important compound in Stephania Tetradra S. Moore ( Fenfangji ) with pain-relieving , blood pressure-depressing , and antibiotic activities , on human PCA .	
20208355_s2	It was found that Fan inhibited human prostate cancer cell lines ( PC3 ) cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner .	
20208355_s3	Studies of cell-cycle progression showed that the anti-proliferative effect of Fan was associated with an increase in the G1/S phase of PC3 cells .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20208355_s4	Western blot results indicated that Fan-induced G1/S phase arrest was mediated through inhibition of cyclin-regulated signaling pathways .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20208355_s5	Fan induced p27 expression and inhibited cyclin D and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) expression in PC3 cells .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20208355_s6	Increased exposure time to Fan caused apoptosis of PC3 cells , which was associated with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase 3 , and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 .	resisting cell death
20208355_s7	Furthermore , Fan had anti-tumorigenic activity in vivo , including reduction of tumor volume and pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in a PC3 nude mouse xenograft .	
20208355_s8	Taking all this together , it can be concluded that Fan is an effective anti-proliferative agent that modulates cell growth regulators in prostate cancer cells .	
20211058_s0	OBJECTIVE To study the effects of genistein on the proliferation , apoptosis induction and expression of related gene proteins of human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo , and its mechanisms of action .	
20211058_s1	METHODS MTT colorimetric assay was used to detect the effects of genistein on the proliferation of human colon adenocarcinoma SW480 cells .	
20211058_s2	Light and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the histological and ultrastructural changes .	
20211058_s3	Flow cytometry was used to determine the effects of genistein on cell cycle and apoptosis .	
20211058_s4	Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the effects of genistein on apoptosis induction and expression of related gene proteins of colon cancer cells .	
20211058_s5	RESULTS The MTT colorimetric assay showed that genistein inhibited the proliferation of SW480 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner , and the highest inhibition rate was 60.2% after 80 microg/ml genistein treatment for 72 h .	
20211058_s6	The light microscopy revealed that many genistein-treated cancer cells were shrunken , disrupted , or showing cytoplasmic vacuolization .	
20211058_s7	The electron microscopic examination showed cell shrinkage , nuclear fragmentation and pronounced chromatin condensation , sometimes formed crescent chromatin condensation attached to the nuclear membrane .	resisting cell death
20211058_s8	The results of flow cytometry showed that : after SW480 cells were treated with 0 , 20 , 40 , 80 microg/ml genistein for 48 h , the FI values of PCNA were 1.49 +/- 0.02 , 1.28 +/- 0.04 , 1.14 +/- 0.03 , and 0.93 +/- 0.08 ; the FI values of VEGF were 1.75 +/- 0.02 , 1.34 +/- 0.06 , 1.32 +/- 0.04 , and 1.23 +/- 0.04 ; the fluorescence index ( FI ) values of p21 were 1.26 +/- 0.05 , 1.36 +/- 0.06 , 1.61 +/- 0.03 , and 1.73 +/- 0.03 , respectively .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20211058_s9	There were statistically significant differences between the control group and each treatment group ( P &lt ; 0.05 or P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	evading growth suppressors
20211058_s10	The scores of immunohistochemical staining of PCNA and VEGF proteins were decreased , while p21 increased .	evading growth suppressors,inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
20211058_s11	There were statistically significant differences between the control group and each treatment group ( P &lt ; 0.05 or P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	
20211058_s12	CONCLUSION Genistein can inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells via apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20211058_s13	The anti-tumor mechanisms of genistein may be related with the down-regulation of expression of VEGF and PCNA , and up-regulation of the expression of p21 .	evading growth suppressors,inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
20214814_s0	BACKGROUND Dendritic cells ( DCs ) isolated from tumor bearing animals or from individuals with solid tumors display functional abnormalities and the DC impairment has emerged as one mechanism for tumor evasion from the control of the immune system .	
20214814_s1	Ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) , the most common pancreatic cancer , is recognized as a very aggressive cancer type with a mortality that almost matches the rate of incidence .	
20214814_s2	METHODS We examined the systemic influence ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) exerted on levels of peripheral blood DCs and inflammatory mediators in comparison to the effects exerted by other pancreatic tumors , chronic pancreatitis , and age-matched controls .	
20214814_s3	RESULTS All groups examined , including PDAC , had decreased levels of myeloid DCs ( MDC ) and plasmacytoid DCs ( PDC ) and enhanced apoptosis in these cells as compared to controls .	
20214814_s4	We found elevated levels of PGE2 and CXCL8 in subjects with PDAC , and chronic pancreatitis .	
20214814_s5	Levels of these inflammatory factors were in part restored in PDAC after tumor resection , whereas the levels of DCs were impaired in the majority of these patients approximately 12 weeks after tumor removal .	tumor promoting inflammation
20214814_s6	Our results prove that solid pancreatic tumors , including PDAC , systemically affect blood DCs .	
20214814_s7	The impairments do not seem to be tumor-specific , since similar results were obtained in subjects with chronic pancreatitis .	
20214814_s8	Furthermore , we found that PDAC patients with a survival over 2 years had significant higher levels of blood DCs compared to patients with less than one year survival .	
20214814_s9	CONCLUSIONS Our findings points to the involvement of inflammation in the destruction of the blood MDCs and PDCs .	tumor promoting inflammation
20214814_s10	Furthermore , the preservation of the blood DCs compartment in PDAC patients seems to benefit their ability to control the disease and survival .	
20215500_s0	Targeting cancer cell metabolism is a new promising strategy to fight cancer .	
20215500_s1	Metformin , a widely used antidiabetic agent , exerts antitumoral and antiproliferative action .	
20215500_s2	In this study , the addition of metformin to 2-deoxyglucose ( 2DG ) inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in prostate cancer cells leading to a severe depletion in ATP .	cellular energetics
20215500_s3	The combination of the two drugs was much more harmful for cancer cells than the treatment with metformin or 2DG alone , leading to 96% inhibition of cell viability in LNCaP prostate cancer cells .	
20215500_s4	In contrast , a moderate effect on cell viability was observed in normal prostate epithelial cells .	
20215500_s5	At the cellular level , the combination of metformin and 2DG induced p53-dependent apoptosis via the energy sensor pathway AMP kinase , and the reexpression of a functional p53 in p53-deficient prostate cancer cells restored caspase-3 activity .	resisting cell death
20215500_s6	In addition to apoptosis , the combination of metformin and 2DG arrested prostate cancer cells in G(2)-M .	
20215500_s7	This G(2)-M arrest was independent of p53 and correlated with a stronger decrease in cell viability than obtained with either drug .	
20215500_s8	Finally , metformin inhibited 2DG-induced autophagy , decreased beclin 1 expression , and triggered a switch from a survival process to cell death .	resisting cell death
20215500_s9	Our study reinforces the growing interest of metabolic perturbators in cancer therapy and highlights the potential use of the combination of metformin and 2DG as an anticancerous treatment .	
20223135_s0	OBJECTIVE To analyze histological factors not routinely assessed as potential prognostic factors in renal cell carcinoma , such as tumor necrosis , microscopic vascular invasion , and sinus fat invasion .	
20223135_s1	MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective , analytical study was conducted of surgical specimens from 139 patients with localized renal cell carcinoma who underwent nephrectomy from 1993 to 2005 .	
20223135_s2	Tumor necrosis , microscopic vascular invasion , and sinus fat invasion were analyzed and compared to the classical factors : TNM classification , Fuhrman grade , and tumor size .	
20223135_s3	For statistical analysis , variables analyzed were categorized as pT1 , 2 vs pT3 , 4 ; Fuhrman grade 1 , 2 vs 3 , 4 ; tumor size &lt ; 7 cm vs &gt;or= 7cm ; tumor necrosis vs no tumor necrosis ; microvascular invasion of sinus fat vs no invasion .	
20223135_s4	Cancer-specific survival probability and disease-free survival were calculated .	
20223135_s5	A descriptive and analytical statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression for univariate and multivariate analyses .	
20223135_s6	Dependent variables were used to analyze cancer-specific survival rates .	
20223135_s7	Disease-free survival was estimated using a Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves .	
20223135_s8	RESULTS In the univariate analysis , all variables analyzed had a significant influence on death for renal cell carcinoma .	
20223135_s9	In the multivariate analysis , the variable having the greatest influence was Fuhrman grade ( p = 0,032 ) .	
20223135_s10	The variables significantly influencing disease-free survival , estimated by the Cox method , were the pT stage ( p = 0.038 ) and Fuhrman grade ( p = 0.048 ) .	
20223135_s11	CONCLUSIONS In patients with clinically localized renal cell carcinoma undergoing nephrectomy , pT stage and Fuhrman grade are the most important prognostic factors for survival and disease-free survival .	
20223135_s12	Tumor necrosis , microscopic vascular invasion , and sinus fat invasion are prognostic factors for death from renal carcinoma which are associated to TNM classification , Fuhrman grade , and tumor size .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
20223349_s0	BACKGROUND Adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) of the Breast is a rare tumour ( less than 1 % of all breast carcinomas ) .	
20223349_s1	The aim of this study was to determine the clinical , histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of these tumours .	
20223349_s2	METHODS From the database of the BergoniÃ© Institute of Bordeaux , 30 cases of ACC were identified .	
20223349_s3	The clinical and histological features of these carcinomas were characterized .	
20223349_s4	An immunohistochemical study was performed with the following antibodies : ER , PR , HER-2-neu , Vimentin , EGFR , P63 , SMA , CK5/6 , CK8/18 , CK14 , cKIT , MIB1 , CD44 and CD24 .	
20223349_s5	RESULTS Thirty patients were included ( median age 60.7 years ) .	
20223349_s6	The 10 axillary lymph node dissections and two sentinel lymph procedures were negative .	
20223349_s7	The architecture was frequently of a mixed type ( 26/30 ) and less often solid ( 4/30 ) .	
20223349_s8	Among the 23 patients for whom follow up was available ( median follow-up : 84 months [ 2-288] ) , there were three local recurrences and three metastatic events .	
20223349_s9	The tumors with recurrence and metastasis showed more necrosis , a mitotic count greater than 4/10hpf , and in one case perineural infiltration .	resisting cell death
20223349_s10	All the tumours were ER , PR and Her-2-neu negative .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20223349_s11	Morphological and immunophenotypical analysis disclosed in each tumor , a basaloid and a luminal cell population with divergent immunophenotypical patterns .	
20223349_s12	CONCLUSIONS The mammary ACC is made of two cell types and is of good prognosis despite its triple negative phenotype , similar to the basal-like infiltrating carcinoma NOS .	
20223349_s13	Axillary lymph node dissection is not recommended .	
20223349_s14	Good local control by at least large lumpectomy with long-term follow-up is necessary .	
20223503_s0	OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of the category of unclassified renal cell carcinoma ( URCC ) on survival following nephrectomy .	
20223503_s1	METHODS Patients with clear cell RCC ( ccRCC , n = 3048 ) and URCC ( n = 38 ) were identified .	
20223503_s2	Patients with URCC were matched 4:1 with ccRCC patients based on year of surgery , symptoms at presentation , tumor size , stage , regional lymph node involvement , metastases , grade , coagulative tumor necrosis , and sarcomatoid differentiation .	
20223503_s3	Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between ccRCC and URCC patients using log-rank tests .	
20223503_s4	RESULTS Patients with URCC were more likely to have regional lymph node involvement ( P &lt;.001 ) , higher grade ( P &lt;.001 ) , tumor necrosis ( P &lt;.001 ) , and sarcomatoid differentiation ( P &lt;.001 ) as compared to patients with ccRCC .	resisting cell death
20223503_s5	Overall survival was not significantly different between URCC and ccRCC patients in either the unmatched ( P = .337 ) or matched ( P = .345 ) cohorts .	
20223503_s6	Cancer-specific survival was significantly worse for URCC patients compared with unmatched ccRCC patients ( P = .020 ) .	
20223503_s7	However , this difference was not statistically significant when the URCC patients were compared with the matched cohort ( P = .688 ) .	
20223503_s8	Distant metastases-free survival was somewhat worse for M0 URCC patients compared with unmatched M0 ccRCC patients ( P = .063 ) , but not in the matched cohort ( P = .788 ) .	
20223503_s9	CONCLUSIONS Although URCC is more likely to present with advanced clinicopathologic features compared with ccRCC , no statistically significant differences in outcome were noted after adjusting for these features in a matched analysis .	
20223881_s0	Pilocytic astrocytoma is commonly viewed as a benign lesion .	
20223881_s1	However , disease onset is most prevalent in the first two decades of life , and children are often left with residual or recurrent disease and significant morbidity .	
20223881_s2	The Hedgehog ( Hh ) pathway regulates the growth of higher WHO grade gliomas , and in this study , we have evaluated the activation and operational status of this regulatory pathway in pilocytic astrocytomas .	
20223881_s3	Expression levels of the Hh pathway transcriptional target PTCH were elevated in 45% of tumor specimens analyzed ( ages 1-22 years ) and correlated inversely with patient age .	
20223881_s4	Evaluation of a tissue array revealed oligodendroglioma-like features , pilomyxoid features , infiltration , and necrosis more commonly in specimens from younger patients ( below the median patient age of 10 years ) .	resisting cell death
20223881_s5	Immunohistochemical staining for the Hh pathway components PTCH and GLI1 and the proliferation marker Ki67 demonstrated that patients diagnosed before the age of 10 had higher staining indices than those diagnosed after the age of 10 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20223881_s6	A significant correlation between Ki67 and PTCH and GLI1 staining indices was measured , and 86% of Ki67-positive cells also expressed PTCH .	
20223881_s7	The operational status of the Hh pathway was confirmed in primary cell culture and could be modulated in a manner consistent with a ligand-dependent mechanism .	
20223881_s8	Taken together , these findings suggest that Hh pathway activation is common in pediatric pilocytic astrocytomas and may be associated with younger age at diagnosis and tumor growth .	
20225150_s0	The BLM helicase is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family and is mutated in the cancer-prone disorder Bloom syndrome .	
20225150_s1	BLM plays a role in a number of cellular processes including DNA double-strand break repair , Holliday junction dissolution , and chromosome segregation .	
20225150_s2	In Drosophila melanogaster , the BLM ortholog ( DmBlm ) is encoded by the mus309 gene .	
20225150_s3	To study the role of DmBlm in double-strand break repair , we utilized a genetic assay in which a targeted DNA double-strand gap is created through excision of a P transposable element .	
20225150_s4	By recovering and molecularly analyzing individual repair products from wild-type and mus309 male pre-meiotic germline cells , we demonstrated that the DmBlm helicase is involved in homologous recombination downstream of strand invasion .	genomic instability and mutation
20225150_s5	This assay can be adapted to test the roles of numerous DNA metabolic factors in DNA double-strand gap repair .	genomic instability and mutation
20234124_s0	OBJECTIVES To investigate the effects of serotonin and melatonin ( MLT ) on the regulation of malignant growth and the activity of serotonin receptors ( 5HTR1a/-1b ) in prostate cancer ( PCa ) cell lines .	
20234124_s1	MATERIALS AND METHODS In four PCa cell lines ( LNCaP , 22RV1 , PC3 , DU145 ) and two reference cell lines 5HTR1a and -1b , relative mRNA expression levels were assessed .	
20234124_s2	Different serotonin and MLT receptor agonists and antagonists were used in stimulation and inhibition experiments .	
20234124_s3	RESULTS mRNA expression of 5HTR1b was higher than that of 5HTR1a in all PCa cell lines .	
20234124_s4	Serotonin showed a significant growth stimulatory effect in all PCa lines .	
20234124_s5	The 5HTR1a and -1b agonists/antagonists did not significantly affect viability .	
20234124_s6	MLT inhibited viability only in PC3 cells .	
20234124_s7	Similarly , the 5HTR1a antagonist induced apoptotic changes in PC3 cells only at 10(-4)M , while the 5HTR1b antagonist induced necrosis at 10(-4)M in all cell lines .	resisting cell death
20234124_s8	Cell cycle alterations were seen in PC3 and DU145 cells under the influence of the 5HTR1a antagonist .	
20234124_s9	CONCLUSIONS Serotonin receptor antagonists and agonists as well as MLT influence viability and apoptosis of PCa cell lines at supraphysiologic concentrations .	resisting cell death
20234124_s10	In contrast to other reports , our results do not support a regulatory role of serotonin or MLT receptor activation or inhibition in PCa growth .	
20237987_s0	Paragangliomas are relatively uncommon neoplasms that arise in adrenal and extra-adrenal paraganglia of the autonomic nervous system .	
20237987_s1	Parasympathetic paraganglioma develop predominantly in the head and neck .	
20237987_s2	It is exceedingly uncommon to develop a primary intraparathyroid paraganglioma .	
20237987_s3	There is only a single case report in the English literature .	
20237987_s4	The information from the single previous case report ( Medline 1960-2009 ) was combined with this case report .

20237987_s16	The patient showed no stigmata of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia ( MEN ) and has no paraganglioma in any other anatomic site .	
20237987_s17	She is alive without any additional findings 12 months after surgery .	
20237987_s18	Isolated paraganglioma within the parathyroid is rare , and should be separated from parathyroid adenoma , hyperplasia or metastatic disease to assure appropriate management .	
20300433_s0	Stannous chloride ( SnCl(2) ) and UVA induce DNA lesions through ROS .	
20300433_s1	The aim of this work was to study the toxicity induced by UVA preillumination , followed by SnCl(2) treatment .	
20300433_s2	E. coli BER mutants were used to identify genes which could play a role in DNA lesion repair generated by these agents .	
20300433_s3	The survival assays showed ( i ) The nfo mutant was the most sensitive to SnCl(2) ; ( ii ) lethal synergistic effect was observed after UVA pre-illumination , plus SnCl(2) incubation , the nfo mutant being the most sensitive ; ( iii ) wild type and nfo mutants , transformed with pBW21 plasmid ( nfo(+) ) had their survival increased following treatments .	
20300433_s4	The alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis assays pointed that ( i ) UVA induced DNA breaks and fpg mutant was the most sensitive ; ( ii ) SnCl(2)-induced DNA strand breaks were higher than those from UVA and nfo mutant had the slowest repair kinetics ; ( iii ) UVA + SnCl(2) promoted an increase in DNA breaks than SnCl(2) and , again , nfo mutant displayed the slowest repair kinetics .	genomic instability and mutation
20300433_s5	In summary , Nfo protects E. coli cells against damage induced by SnCl(2) and UVA + SnCl(2) .	
20303261_s0	PURPOSE Tamoxifen , a selective oestrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) , and brivanib alaninate , a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) inhibitor , are two target specific agents that result in a substantial decrease in tumour growth when given alone .	
20303261_s1	Tamoxifen activates SERM stimulated breast and endometrial tumour growth .	
20303261_s2	Tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate have side-effects that can affect therapeutic outcomes .	
20303261_s3	The primary goal of the current study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of lower doses of both agents when given in combination to mice with SERM sensitive , oestrogen stimulated tumour xenografts ( MCF-7 E2 tumours ) .	
20303261_s4	Experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of SERM stimulated breast ( MCF-7 Tam , MCF-7 Ral ) and endometrial tumours ( EnCa 101 ) to demonstrate the activity of brivanib alaninate in SERM resistant models .	
20303261_s5	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In the current study , tumour xenografts were minced and bi-transplanted into the mammary fat pads of athymic , ovariectomised mice .	
20303261_s6	Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine an effective oral dose of tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate that had minimal effect on tumour growth .	
20303261_s7	Doses of 125 microg of tamoxifen and 0.05 mg/g of brivanib alaninate were evaluated .	
20303261_s8	An experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of the two agents together when started at the time of tumour implantation .	
20303261_s9	An additional experiment was done in which tumours were already established and then treated , to obtain enough tumour tissue for molecular analysis .	
20303261_s10	RESULTS Brivanib alaninate was effective at inhibiting tumour growth in SERM sensitive ( MCF-7 E2 ) and SERM stimulated ( EnCa 101 , MCF-7 Ral , MCF-7 Tam ) models .	
20303261_s11	The effect of the low dose drug combination as an anti-tumour strategy for SERM sensitive ( MCF-7 E2 ) in early treatment was as effective as higher doses of either drug used alone .	
20303261_s12	In established tumours , the combination is successful at decreasing tumour growth , while neither agent alone is effective .	
20303261_s13	Molecular analysis revealed a decreased phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in tumours that were treated with brivanib alaninate and an increase in VEGFA transcription to compensate for the blockade of VEGFR-2 by increasing the transcription of VEGFA .	
20303261_s14	Tamoxifen increases the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and this effect is abrogated by brivanib alaninate .	
20303261_s15	There was also increased necrosis in tumours treated with brivanib alaninate .	resisting cell death
20303261_s16	CONCLUSION Historically , tamoxifen has a role in blocking angiogenesis as well as the blockade of the ER .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
20303261_s17	Tamoxifen and a low dose of an angiogenesis inhibitor , brivanib alaninate , can potentially be combined not only to maximise therapeutic efficacy but also to retard SERM resistant tumour growth .	
20307623_s0	Exposure to benzo[a]pyrene ( BaP ) can induce inflammatory skin diseases and skin cancer , which are both associated to oxidative stress .	
20307623_s1	BaP is known to bind with high specificity to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) , modifying the expression of CYP1A1 , involved both in cancer and inflammation .	
20307623_s2	While the current knowledge is based on murine skin and cell culture data , in this study human healthy skin has been treated with 5muM BaP in conditions simulating occupational and environmental exposure .	
20307623_s3	AhR and CYP1A1 expression was evaluated by Western blotting , which revealed their presence even in control untreated skin ; both enzyme and receptor increased more than twofold after exposure to BaP .	
20307623_s4	AhR expression level was lower than CYP1A1 in basal conditions and following induction .	
20307623_s5	Oxidative stress was evaluated in terms of MTT reduction , protein peroxidation and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) formation .	tumor promoting inflammation
20307623_s6	A significant increase in ROS and carbonyl compound production , as well as reduced tissue viability have been determined by BaP .	
20307623_s7	The results of this experiment indicate that BaP , an AhR agonist , can significantly increase receptor and CYP1A1 expression and induce oxidative stress in human skin , confirming the involvement of this pathway in the pathogenesis of tissue damage due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .	tumor promoting inflammation
20331621_s0	Cantharidin is an active constituent of mylabris , a traditional Chinese medicine .	
20331621_s1	It is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) that plays an important role in control of cell cycle , apoptosis , and cell-fate determination .	
20331621_s2	Owing to its antitumor activity , cantharidin has been frequently used in clinical practice .	
20331621_s3	In the present study , we investigated the therapeutic potential of cantharidin in pancreatic cancer .	
20331621_s4	Cantharidin efficiently inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells , but presented a much lighter toxicity effect against normal pancreatic duct cells .	
20331621_s5	It caused G2/M cell-cycle arrest that was accompanied by the down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 ) and up-regulation of p21 expression .	evading growth suppressors
20331621_s6	It induced apoptosis and elevated the expressions of pro-apoptotic factors tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , TNF-related apoptosis inducing receptor 1 ( TRAILR1 ) , TRAILR2 , Bad , Bak , and Bid , and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 .	resisting cell death
20331621_s7	Activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 suggested that both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are involved in the induction of apoptosis .	resisting cell death
20331621_s8	Interestingly , unlike previous studies on other cancer cells , we found that the inhibitory role of cantharidin is independent of oxidative stress in pancreatic cancer cells .	
20331621_s9	Mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , including ERK , JNK , and p38 , were activated after treatment with cantharidin .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20331621_s10	Inhibition of JNK , but not ERK or p38 , alleviated the cytotoxity effect of cantharidin , suggesting cantharidin exerted its anticancer effect through the JNK-dependent way .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20331621_s11	Hence , in addition to being an attractive candidate compound with therapeutic potential , cantharidin also highlighted the possibility of using PP2A as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer treatment .	
20332242_s0	" Reactive " or activated stroma characterizes many malignancies including breast cancers .	
20332242_s1	Recently , we isolated a reactive mouse mammary gland stromal cell line called BJ3Z .	
20332242_s2	These cells express alpha-smooth muscle actin and stromal cell-derived factor 1 ( SDF-1 ) and are tumorigenic when injected into mice .	
20332242_s3	Here we show that , in vivo , BJ3Z cells influence the angiogenesis and proliferation of xenografted estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell-derived solid tumors .	
20332242_s4	The growth-promoting effects of BJ3Z cells are equivalent to those of estradiol ( E(2) ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20332242_s5	BJ3Z cells also increase the proliferation of normal mouse mammary luminal cells adjacent to tumors .	
20332242_s6	In vitro , BJ3Z cells reorganize and increase the proliferation of cocultured malignant MCF-7 and normal human breast MCF10A cells grown as organoids in three-dimensional culture .	
20332242_s7	The effects of BJ3Z cells on MCF-7 cells are equivalent to those of E(2) .	
20332242_s8	In contrast , BJ3Z cells do not alter the growth of highly aggressive ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells .	
20332242_s9	We show that BJ3Z cells secrete vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) .	inducing angiogenesis
20332242_s10	The growth of MCF-7 organoids induced by BJ3Z can be inhibited by antagonists of VEGF and SDF-1 .	
20332242_s11	Conversely , recombinant VEGF stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 , but not MDA-MB-231 , organoids .	
20332242_s12	We conclude that , in addition to angiogenesis , VEGF released by activated stroma increases the growth of ER-positive malignant epithelial cells and of adjacent normal epithelium .	
20332242_s13	Because activated stroma can substitute for E(2) and fosters hormone-independent growth of ER-positive tumors , we suggest that breast cancers exhibiting intrinsic hormone resistance may respond to antiangiogenic therapies .	
20332304_s0	Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol that exhibits pleiotropic health beneficial effects , including anti-inflammatory , cardio-protective , and cancer-protective activities .	
20332304_s1	It is recognized as one of the more promising natural molecules in the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders .	
20332304_s2	Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic , chronic inflammatory disease of the colon associated with a high colon cancer risk .	
20332304_s3	Here , we used a dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) mouse model of colitis , which resembles human ulcerative colitis pathology .	
20332304_s4	Resveratrol mixed in food ameliorates DSS-induced colitis in mice in a dose-dependent manner .	
20332304_s5	Resveratrol significantly improves inflammation score , downregulates the percentage of neutrophils in the mesenteric lymph nodes and lamina propria , and modulates CD3(+) T cells that express tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IFN-gamma .	tumor promoting inflammation
20332304_s6	Markers of inflammation and inflammatory stress ( p53 and p53-phospho-Ser(15) ) are also downregulated by resveratrol .	tumor promoting inflammation
20332304_s7	Because chronic colitis drives colon cancer risk , we carried out experiments to determine the chemopreventive properties of resveratrol .	
20332304_s8	Tumor incidence is reduced from 80% in mice treated with azoxymethane ( AOM ) + DSS to 20% in mice treated with AOM + DSS + resveratrol ( 300 ppm ) .	
20332304_s9	Tumor multiplicity also decreased with resveratrol treatment .	
20332304_s10	AOM + DSS-treated mice had 2.4 +/- 0.7 tumors per animal compared with AOM + DSS + 300 ppm resveratrol , which had 0.2 +/- 0.13 tumors per animal .	
20332304_s11	The current study indicates that resveratrol is a useful , nontoxic complementary and alternative strategy to abate colitis and potentially colon cancer associated with colitis .	
20333571_s0	BACKGROUND The current staging system provides an anatomical classification of lung tumors ; its secondary purpose is to allow the prognostic stratification of patients into homogeneous groups after surgery .	
20333571_s1	In this work , intratumoral perineural invasion , lymphatic and blood vessel invasion together with the necrosis content of the tumor exclusive of the non-small cell cancer staging system were studied .	
20333571_s2	METHODS During a 4-year period , 152 patients operated for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) at our hospital were analyzed .	
20333571_s3	Mean age of patients was 55.7 +/- 10.1 years .	
20333571_s4	RESULTS Overall 5-year survival was 42.2 % .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
20333571_s5	Mediastinal lymph node involvement , tumor size , incomplete resection , pneumonectomy , presence of necrosis and perineural invasion were significant prognosticators ( P = 0.03 , 0.04 , 0.0001 , 0.046 , 0.0246 , &lt ; 0.0001 , respectively ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
20333571_s6	Multivariate analysis revealed that N status , perineural invasion , and the presence of necrosis were independent prognostic factors ( P = 0.006 , P = 0.001 , P = 0.001 , respectively ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
20333571_s7	Patients who had stage I tumor with necrosis and perineural invasion had a lower survival rate than those with stage IIIA tumor without these histopathological features ( P = 0.04 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
20333571_s8	The presence of these histopathological characteristics in stage IIIA patients was a sign of a poorer prognosis ( P = 0.0001 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
20333571_s9	CONCLUSIONS Perineural invasion and the presence of necrosis independently indicated a dismal prognosis and their prognostic power is comparable to those of the TNM classification .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
20333571_s10	These factors could be candidates for better survival stratification and the indicators of the need for adjuvant therapy in early stage lung cancer patients .	
20333679_s0	It has been shown that injecting a suspension of IFN-Î³-secreting tumor cells results in their rejection .	
20333679_s1	This effect has been attributed to IFN-Î³ preventing tumor stroma formation but not to a direct effect on the cancer cells .	
20333679_s2	However , it is not known , which influence IFN-Î³ has on tumors with an established stroma .	
20333679_s3	To address this question , the plasmacytoma cell line J558L was transduced with a vector allowing doxycycline-inducible IFN-Î³ gene expression .	
20333679_s4	After the injection of the tumor cells into mice , IFN-Î³ was induced at different time points .	
20333679_s5	Tumors did not grow when inducing IFN-Î³ immediately after tumor cell inoculation , while approximately half of the tumors were rejected when IFN-Î³ was induced in early established tumors within 2 weeks .	
20333679_s6	Induction of IFN-Î³ 2-3 weeks after tumor cell inoculation was less efficient ( 0-17% rejection ) .	
20333679_s7	IFN-Î³ induction in established tumors led to a reduction of CD146(+) endothelial cells and massive necrosis .	resisting cell death
20333679_s8	Together , we show that vascularized tumors can be rejected by local IFN-Î³ expression , but that rejection of established tumors was less efficient over time .	inducing angiogenesis
20333679_s9	This suggests that transplanted tumors became less susceptible to local IFN-Î³ treatment the better they are established .	
20334580_s0	Palmitoylation is required for the activities of several cancer-associated proteins , making the palmitoyl acyltransferase ( PAT ) enzymes that catalyze these reactions potential targets for anticancer therapeutics .	
20334580_s1	In this study , we sought to identify and characterize a human PAT with activity toward N-terminally myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins .	
20334580_s2	NIH/3t3 cells were stably transfected with vectors containing no insert , wild type human DHHC20 , or a serine-substituted DHHS20 mutant .	
20334580_s3	Compared with control cells , cells overexpressing wild-type DHHC20 displayed an increase in palmitoylation activity toward a peptide that mimics the N-terminus of myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins , but had no change in activity toward a peptide that mimics the C-terminus of farnesylated and palmitoylated proteins .	
20334580_s4	Cells expressing DHHS20 had no significant change in activity toward either peptide .	
20334580_s5	Overexpression of DHHC20 also caused phenotypic changes consistent with cellular transformation , including colony formation in soft agar , decreased contact inhibition of growth , and increased proliferation under low-serum conditions .	evading growth suppressors
20334580_s6	Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses of human tissues demonstrated that DHHC20 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner , and is overexpressed in several types of human tumors , including ovarian , breast and prostate .	
20334580_s7	Overall , these results demonstrate that DHHC20 is a human N-terminal-myristoyl-directed PAT involved in cellular transformation , that may play a role in cancer .	
20336315_s0	PURPOSE Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 ( PKM2 ) is a key enzyme in aerobic glycolysis ; inhibition of PKM2 leads to the tumor growth inhibition .	
20336315_s1	In this study , the effects of combined treatment with cisplatin ( DDP ) and a plasmid that expresses a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) targeting PKM2 on the growth of human A549 xenograft lung cancer model were investigated .	
20336315_s2	METHODS The expression of PKM2 in A549 cells was determined by immunofluorescence .	
20336315_s3	PKM2 expression levels were evaluated by Western blot analysis .	
20336315_s4	In a human A549 lung cancer xenograft model , the effects of treatment with shRNA , with or without cisplatin , on tumor volume were determined .	
20336315_s5	Apoptosis and cell proliferation status were examined to determine the mechanisms of tumor growth inhibition .	
20336315_s6	RESULTS Expression of shRNA targeting PKM2 resulted in inhibition of PKM2 expression in A549 cells .	
20336315_s7	In the lung cancer xenograft model , average tumor volume in the group treated with both cisplatin and shRNA was statistically lower than those of other groups ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
20336315_s8	The levels of apoptotic cells were significantly higher in samples from animals in the combined treatment group than those from untreated animals ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	resisting cell death
20336315_s9	The cell proliferation rate , as determined by counting cells labeled with an anti-phospho-histone H3 , a marker for mitosis , was lower in samples from animals treated with both cisplatin and shRNA than in samples from other groups ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
20336315_s10	CONCLUSIONS Use of RNA interfering ( RNAi ) targeting PKM2 significantly inhibited tumor growth when combined with cisplatin in a human A549 lung cancer xenograft model .	
20336315_s11	The enhanced antitumor activity of the combined treatment compared to treatment with shRNA alone may result in part from increased induction of apoptosis and augmented inhibition of cancer cell proliferation .	
20336777_s0	Certain hexavalent chromium ( Cr(VI) ) compounds are well established occupational respiratory tract carcinogens .	
20336777_s1	However , despite extensive studies , the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Cr(VI)-induced lung cancer remain poorly understood .	
20336777_s2	In fact , the models used were often suboptimal and yielded conflicting results that were heavily dependent upon the system and experimental conditions employed .	
20336777_s3	Here , we investigated the effects of chronic subcytotoxic and mildly cytotoxic ( 0.1-2 microM ) Cr(VI) exposures on cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells , the main targets of Cr(VI) carcinogenicity .	
20336777_s4	Our studies with the nontumorigenic BEAS-2B cell line suggest that relatively short exposures ( h ) to sublethal Cr(VI) doses ( 0.1-1 microM ) may render these cells less sensitive to contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
20336777_s5	We have also observed a reduced sensitivity to Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis shortly after the beginning of exposure to a mildly cytotoxic Cr(VI) dose ( 2 microM ) .	resisting cell death
20336777_s6	Further studies are needed to determine whether these two phenotypes are involved in the Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenic process .	
20336777_s7	Additionally , evidence gathered in this study strongly points to a Cr(VI) interference with cell adhesion to the substratum and with cell-cell interactions .	
20336777_s8	Finally , by chronically exposing BEAS-2B cells to mildly cytotoxic Cr(VI) doses ( 1 and 2 microM ) , we were able to induce changes in cell morphology and pattern of growth characteristic of an early phase of pre-malignant progression .	
20339477_s0	To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying altered T cell response in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) patients , we compared autologous and allogeneic CD8(+) T cell responses against RCC line from RCC patients and their HLA-matched donors , using mixed lymphocyte/tumor cell cultures ( MLTCs ) .	
20339477_s1	In addition , we analyzed the expression of molecules associated with cell cycle regulation .	
20339477_s2	Autologous MLTC responder CD8(+) T cells showed cytotoxic activity against RCC cell lines ; however the analysis of the distribution of CD8(+) T-cell subsets revealed that allogenic counterparts mediate superior antitumor efficacy .	
20339477_s3	In RCC patients , a decreased proliferative response to tumor , associated with defects in JAK3/STAT5/6 expression that led to increased p27KIP1 expression and alterations in the cell cycle , was observed .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20339477_s4	These data define a molecular pathway involved in cell cycle regulation that is associated with the dysfunction of tumor-specific CD8(+) effector cells .	
20339477_s5	If validated , this may define a therapeutic target in the setting of patients with RCC .	
20347380_s0	This research aims to give a new insight to the relationship between host local immune response and the biological behaviour of the tumor by evaluating of intratumoral natural killer ( NK ) cells and tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) expressions in oral squamous cell carcinomas .	
20347380_s1	New paraffin sections of the deepest parts of the 46 cases of oral squamous cell carcinomas were immunohistochemically treated by CD57 , selected as NK cell indicator , and TNFalpha monoclonal antibodies .	
20347380_s2	The tumors were graded according to histopathologic grading scores of invasive margins and categorized into 2 groups as " good " and " poor " prognostic groups .	
20347380_s3	Fifteen cases , from which could be obtained full clinical data , were clinically staged and because of the scarcity of the cases in each group were divided , again , two groups as group 1 : stage I+stage II and group 2 : stage III+stage IV .	
20347380_s4	The expression levels of CD57 and TNFalpha were evaluated according to histopathologic grading groups and clinical staging groups .	
20347380_s5	The results showed that the density of CD57+cells ( NK cells ) was statistically lower in tumors graded as poor prognostic group compared to the cases in good prognostic group .	
20347380_s6	On the contrary , expression level of TNFalpha was statistically higher in poor prognostic group .	
20347380_s7	These findings suggested that increased secretion of TNFalpha in the tumors , which show high invasive potential , may be one of the facilitating factors for tumor invasion and be responsible from suppression of NK cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
20347380_s8	Withdrawal of NK cells in the high invasive tumor areas also reminds the necessity of certain shared genetic rearrangements in tumor cells for getting protected from NK cell attacks and moving ahead within the extracellular matrix .	
20349282_s0	We report that all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) in combination with zoledronic acid has strong synergistic cytotoxic and apoptotic effects against human hormone- and drug-refractory prostate cancer cells , PC-3 and DU-145 , in a time- and dose-dependent manner .	
20349282_s1	We further investigated the effect of the combination treatment on the apoptotic process by both oligoarray and protein array analysis in DU-145 cells , in which the drug combination shows much more strong synergistic effects , as compared to PC-3 cells .	
20349282_s2	Moreover , we have also performed real time-PCR array analysis to validate oligoarray results .	
20349282_s3	We demonstrated that the combination of ATRA and zoledronic acid is a strong inducer of apoptotic related cell death in human androgen-and drug refractory prostate cancer cells DU-145 , at either transcriptional or translational levels .	resisting cell death
20349282_s4	While expression of proapoptotic genes such as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily ( TNFRSF ) , Bad , Bax , Fas , FADD are induced with the exposure of the combination , expression of antiapoptotic genes or proteins such as members of inhibitor apoptosis family ( IAPs ) , MCL-1 , LTBR , p53 and bcl-2 are reduced .	resisting cell death
20349282_s5	Because this novel combination treatment has fewer side effects than is generally the case with conventional cytotoxic agents , this regimen may be a good option for treatment of elderly prostate cancer patients .	
20350779_s0	The transcription factor NF-kappaB is constitutively active in pancreatic adenocarcinoma .	
20350779_s1	Here we explore the contribution of NF-kappaB to the malignant phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells in addition to its anti-apoptotic role .	
20350779_s2	Block of NF-kappaB signalling by non-destructible IkappaBalpha rendered cells resistant to TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
20350779_s3	In contrast , NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha or expression of constitutively active IKK2 induced an EMT-phenotype with up-regulation of vimentin and ZEB1 , and down-regulation of E-cadherin .	
20350779_s4	EMT could also be induced in cells with defective TGF-beta signalling .	
20350779_s5	Functional assays demonstrated reduced or strongly enhanced migration and invasion upon NF-kappaB inhibition or activation , respectively .	activating invasion and metastasis
20351312_s0	Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are key regulators of innate and acquired immunity .	
20351312_s1	The maturation of DCs is directed by signal transduction events downstream of toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) and other pattern recognition receptors .	
20351312_s2	Here , we demonstrate that , in mouse DCs , TLR agonists stimulate a profound metabolic transition to aerobic glycolysis , similar to the Warburg metabolism displayed by cancer cells .	cellular energetics
20351312_s3	This metabolic switch depends on the phosphatidyl inositol 3'-kinase/Akt pathway , is antagonized by the adenosine monophosphate ( AMP)-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , and is required for DC maturation .	
20351312_s4	The metabolic switch induced by DC activation is antagonized by the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 .	tumor promoting inflammation
20351312_s5	Our data pinpoint TLR-mediated metabolic conversion as essential for DC maturation and function and reveal it as a potential target for intervention in the control of excessive inflammation and inappropriately regulated immune responses .	tumor promoting inflammation
20352345_s0	We have investigated the possibility that photoexcited titanium dioxide ( TiO2 ) could inhibit the growth of malignant cells .	
20352345_s1	We studied the anti-glioma effects of nano-TiO2 excited with ultraviolet A ( UVA ) irradiation both in vitro and in vivo .	
20352345_s2	Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that glioma cells take up TiO2 by phagocytosis , and vital staining revealed that TiO2 alone has no effect on glioma cell proliferation .	
20352345_s3	However , if TiO2 was combined with UVA irradiation the proliferation rate was decreased significantly compared to controls ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	
20352345_s4	RT-PCR suggested that TiO2 induction of glioma cell apoptosis is associated with changes in the expression of genes encoding Bcl-2 family members .	
20352345_s5	We then investigated the in vivo antitumor effects of combined TiO2 plus UVA treatment of established glioma tumors .	
20352345_s6	TiO2 plus UVA led to pronounced areas of necrosis , elevated indices of apoptosis , delayed tumor growth , and increased survival compared with the TiO2-alone control group ( P&lt;0.001 ) .	resisting cell death
20352345_s7	Log-rank survival analysis showed that median survival duration was prolonged ( P&lt;0.001 ) .	
20352345_s8	These findings suggest that nano-TiO2 based photodynamic therapy has potential in the treatment of glioma .	
20353033_s0	OBJECTIVE To study the effect of Zilongjin ( ZLJ , a composite Chinese drug ) on proliferation and apoptosis of human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 .	
20353033_s1	METHODS MCF-7 cells were randomly divided into four groups depending on the culture solution used , the control group , cultured with 1640 medium not contained ZLJ ; and the three ZJL groups cultured with medium contained low ( 1.5 mg/mL ) , moderate ( 3 mg/mL ) and high ( 6 mg/mL ) dosage of ZLJ crude drug respectively .	
20353033_s2	The changes of cell proliferation were assessed by cell growth curve assay and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) assay .	
20353033_s3	And the cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry , Hoechst 33342 staining and DNA ladder assay .	
20353033_s4	RESULTS Compared with that in the normal control , the counts of cells in the three ZLJ groups were decreased significantly ( P&lt;0.05 ) at such time point as 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 , and 144 h .	
20353033_s5	Furthermore , apart from the comparison of the growth inhibition rate between the low and moderate dosage group at 24 and 72 h which were found to be no significant difference ( P&gt;0.05 ) , the comparison f that among the three ZLJ groups appeared to be significant difference ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	
20353033_s6	The inhibitory effect of ZLJ on cell proliferation of MCF-7 was time- and dose-dependent ; it could retard cells in G0/G1 cell phase ; apoptosis of MCF-7 cell was induced by moderate and high dosage of ZLJ with revealing of apoptotic body and DNA ladder formation .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20353033_s7	CONCLUSION ZLJ shows cell proliferation inhibitory and apoptosis inducing effects on human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 , and thus to realize its anti-tumor action .	
20354270_s0	Chronic inflammation , increased reactivity to self-antigens and incidences of cancer are hallmarks of aging .	
20354270_s1	However , the underlying mechanisms are not well understood .	
20354270_s2	Age-associated alterations in the DNA either due to oxidative damage , defects in DNA repair or epigenetic modifications such as methylation that lead to mutations and changes in the expression of genes are thought to be partially responsible .	
20354270_s3	Here we report that epigenetic modifications in aged DNA also increase its immunogenicity rendering it more reactive to innate immune system cells such as the dendritic cells .	avoiding immune destruction
20354270_s4	We observed increased upregulation of costimulatory molecules as well as enhanced secretion of IFN-alpha from dendritic cells in response to DNA from aged donors as compared to DNA from young donors when it was delivered intracellularly via Lipofectamine .	
20354270_s5	Investigations into the mechanisms revealed that DNA from aged subjects is not degraded , neither is it more damaged compared to DNA from young subjects .	
20354270_s6	However , there is significantly decreased global level of methylation suggesting that age-associated hypomethylation of the DNA may be the cause of its increased immunogenicity .	avoiding immune destruction
20354270_s7	Increased immunogenicity of self DNA may thus be another mechanism that may contribute to the increase in age-associated chronic inflammation , autoimmunity and cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
20354842_s0	Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) and agonistic anti-DR4/TRAIL-R1 and anti-DR5/TRAIL-R2 antibodies are currently under clinical investigation for treatment of different malignancies .	
20354842_s1	TRAIL activates DR4 and DR5 and thereby triggers apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling pathways , but possible different roles of DR4 or DR5 in these responses has poorly been addressed so far .	
20354842_s2	In the present work , we analyzed cell viability , DISC formation as well as IL-8 and NF-kappaB activation side by side in responses to TRAIL and agonistic antibodies against DR4 ( mapatumumab ) and against DR5 ( lexatumumab ) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells .	
20354842_s3	We found that all three reagents are able to activate cell death and pro-inflammatory signaling .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20354842_s4	Death-inducing signaling complex ( DISC ) analysis revealed that mapatumumab and lexatumumab induce formation of homocomplexes of either DR4 or DR5 , whereas TRAIL additionally stimulated the formation of heterocomplexes of both receptors .	
20354842_s5	Notably , blocking of receptors using DR4- and DR5-specific Fab fragments indicated that TRAIL exerted its function predominantly via DR4 .	
20354842_s6	Interestingly , inhibition of PKC by Goe6983 enabled DR5 to trigger apoptotic signaling in response to TRAIL and also strongly enhanced lexatumumab-mediated cell death .	resisting cell death
20354842_s7	Our results suggest the existence of mechanisms that silence DR5 for TRAIL- but not for agonistic-antibody treatment .	
20355335_s0	Ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) kinase is a central player in cellular response to DNA damage .	
20355335_s1	Phosphorylation of the histone H2AX by ATM is required for the accumulation of repair proteins at the sites of double-strand breaks .	
20355335_s2	Recently , it was reported that the histone acetyltransferase Tat interactive protein-60 ( IPP60 ) is required to acetylate ATM prior to its activation .	
20355335_s3	The RuvB-like proteins TIP48 and TIP49 are known to be necessary for the assembly and functional activity of the TIP60 acetyltransferase complex .	
20355335_s4	In the present communication , we investigated the requirements of IIP48 and IIP49 for ATM activation by monitoring the cell cycle distribution and H2AX phosphorylation after irradiation of IIP48- and IIP49-depleted cells .	
20355335_s5	We found that neither the cell cycle norgammay-H2AX were affected in IIP48- and IIP49-silenced cells , suggesting that the IIP60 chromatin modification complex is not engaged in DNA damage signaling upstream of ATM .	genomic instability and mutation
20356387_s0	BACKGROUND Autotaxin ( ATX ) is an extracellular lysophospholipase D that generates lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) from lysophosphatidylcholine ( LPC ) .	
20356387_s1	Both ATX and LPA have been shown to be involved in many cancers .	
20356387_s2	However , the functional role of ATX and the regulation of ATX expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) remain elusive .	
20356387_s3	RESULTS In this study , ATX expression was evaluated in tissues from 38 human HCC and 10 normal control subjects .	
20356387_s4	ATX was detected mainly in tumor cells within tissue sections and its over-expression in HCC was specifically correlated with inflammation and liver cirrhosis .	
20356387_s5	In addition , ATX expression was examined in normal human hepatocytes and liver cancer cell lines .	
20356387_s6	Hepatoma Hep3B and Huh7 cells displayed stronger ATX expression than hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells and normal hepatocytes did .	
20356387_s7	Proinflammtory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) promoted ATX expression and secretion selectively in Hep3B and Huh7 cells , which led to a corresponding increase in lysophospholipase-D activity .	tumor promoting inflammation
20356387_s8	Moreover , we explored the mechanism governing the expression of ATX in hepatoma cells and established a critical role of nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-kappaB ) in basal and TNF-alpha induced ATX expression .	
20356387_s9	Further study showed that secreted enzymatically active ATX stimulated Hep3B cell invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
20356387_s10	CONCLUSIONS This report highlights for the first time the clinical and biological evidence for the involvement of ATX in human HCC .	
20356387_s11	Our observation that links the TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB axis and the ATX-LPA signaling pathway suggests that ATX is likely playing an important role in inflammation related liver tumorigenesis .	tumor promoting inflammation
20357441_s0	BACKGROUND Paclitaxel and pirarubicin exhibit cytotoxic and antitumor activities .	
20357441_s1	However , little is known about the apoptosis-inducing effects of paclitaxel and pirarubicin on human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells .	
20357441_s2	METHODS The effects of paclitaxel and pirarubicin on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were studied in MG-63 cells using flow cytometry .	
20357441_s3	PCNA , Bcl-2 , Bax , cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression was assessed by Western blotting .	
20357441_s4	RESULTS Paclitaxel and pirarubicin caused G2/M and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in MG-63 cells , respectively .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20357441_s5	Apoptosis of MG-63 cells mediated by paclitaxel was dependent on treatment duration .	resisting cell death
20357441_s6	Interestingly , in cells treated with pirarubicin , apoptosis was related to treatment duration at concentrations of 10(2)-10(3) nM , whereas the effect of treatment duration was less marked at concentrations &gt;10(4)-10(5) nM .	resisting cell death
20357441_s7	Furthermore , paclitaxel and pirarubicin suppressed the expression of PCNA , cyclin D1 , cyclin E and Bcl-2 , and increased Bax expression .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20357441_s8	CONCLUSION These results suggest that the G2/M or G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by paclitaxel and pirarubicin are Bcl-2/Bax dependent , suggesting favorable effects of combination therapy with paclitaxel and pirarubicin in the treatment of osteosarcoma .	
20358470_s0	Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable ( F&amp;V ) consumption and the risk of cancer .	
20358470_s1	Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed , such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities ; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate .	
20358470_s2	We investigated , in a randomized , controlled , crossover feeding trial , the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&amp;V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage ; resistance to gamma -irradiation damage ; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes , measured by the Comet assay .	
20358470_s3	We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures .	
20358470_s4	Healthy men ( n = 11 ) and women ( n = 17 ) , age 20 to 40 yr , provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period .	
20358470_s5	Overall , F&amp;V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes .	genomic instability and mutation
20358470_s6	The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma -irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity , but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear .	genomic instability and mutation
20358470_s7	A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
20358470_s8	With inconsistent findings in the literature , additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&amp;V on DNA damage and repair are needed .	genomic instability and mutation
20363723_s0	OBJECTIVE As we previously demonstrated , the inhibitory effect of iodine on thyroid cell growth is mediated by iodolactones , especially 6-iodo-5-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid ( delta-iodolactone ) .	
20363723_s1	In this communication we compare the effect of iodide , molecular iodine and delta-iodolactone on growth inhibition and apoptosis on three human thyroid carcinoma cell lines ( B-CPAP cells , FTC-133 cells and 8505C cells ) as well as on human breast cancer cells ( MCF 7 ) .	
20363723_s2	METHODS Thyroid carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium ( DMEM ) and MCF 7 cells in Rowswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) culture medium , both containing 10% ( v/v ) Fetal Calf Serum ( FCS ) , until they were confluent .	
20363723_s3	Around 2000 cells were then distributed in 12-well plates and grown for 48 h in either DMEM ( thyroid cancer cells ) or in RPMI medium ( MCF 7 cells ) both containing 5% FCS .	
20363723_s4	Thereafter , different concentrations of iodide , iodine or delta-iodolactone were added for 24 h .	
20363723_s5	Growth rate was estimated by cell counting in a Coulter Counter adapted for epithelial cells .	
20363723_s6	Apoptosis was determined by a mitochondrial potential assay .	
20363723_s7	RESULTS The growth rate of B-CPAP cells was unaffected by iodide , but was reduced by high concentreations of molecular iodine ( 100 and 500 microM ) .	
20363723_s8	However , delta-iodolactone significantly reduced cell proliferation already with low concentrations ( 5 microM and 10 microM ) and further in a dose-dependent manner up to 82% .	
20363723_s9	FTC-133 and 8505C cells were unaffected by iodide , iodine or delta-iodolactone .	
20363723_s10	In contrast , in MCF 7 cells , molecular iodine ( 100 microM ) inhibited growth from 100% to 83% but delta-iodolactone ( 1 , 5 and 10 microM ) dose-dependently decreased growth rate from 100% to 82% and 62% , respectively .	
20363723_s11	The inhibition of growth was through apoptosis , and not necrosis , as the amount of apoptotic cells corresponded to the growth inhibition .	resisting cell death
20363723_s12	CONCLUSION delta-Iotaodolactone seems to be the main iodocompound which can inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in B-CPAP cells as well as in MCF 7 breast cancer cells .	
20363913_s0	NKX3.1 is a homeodomain protein that functions as a dosage sensitive prostate-specific transcription factor .	
20363913_s1	Diminished NKX3.1 expression is associated with prostate epithelial cell proliferation in vitro and with increasing Gleason grade in patient samples .	
20363913_s2	Mouse Nkx3.1 also functions as a negative regulator of prostate cell growth in prostate cancer models .	
20363913_s3	Identifying biological and environmental factors that modulate NKX3.1 accumulation is therefore central to efforts aimed at elucidating prostate growth control mechanisms .	
20363913_s4	To determine the effect of inflammation on Nxk3.1 accumulation , bacterial prostatitis was induced by intraurethral inoculation of a uropathogenic E. coli strain in mice .	
20363913_s5	Nkx3.1 expression was profoundly reduced in infected prostate lobes and correlated with increased expression of a proliferation marker .	
20363913_s6	Androgen receptor levels were also reduced in concert with Nkx3.1 , and a marked increase in the basal cell marker p63 was observed .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20363913_s7	Analyses of the inflammatory infiltrate revealed a classic acute inflammatory response that attained characteristics of a chronic state within fourteen days postinoculation .	tumor promoting inflammation
20363913_s8	Comparison of the four prostate lobes revealed clear differences in the extent of inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
20363913_s9	These data demonstrate that acute inflammation in response to a bacterial agent in the prostate is associated with a significant diminution in the level of a key regulator of prostate cell proliferation .	tumor promoting inflammation
20363913_s10	These observations provide a plausible mechanism whereby prostate inflammation may establish a local environment conducive to epithelial cell growth .	tumor promoting inflammation
20364579_s0	OBJECTIVE To clarify the relationship between the expression of pol beta and DNA damage /repair induced by Benzo(a)pyrene ( BaP ) .	
20364579_s1	METHODS pol beta wild-type cells ( pol beta +/+ ) , pol beta null cells ( pol beta -/- ) and wild-type pol beta overexpressed cells ( pol beta oe ) which had the same genetic background were studied .	
20364579_s2	Firstly , RT-PCR and Western blot targeting to pol beta were carried out to measure the expression of pol beta mRNA and protein in above three kinds of cells , then MTT test and single cell gel electrophoresis ( comet assay ) were used to compare cell viability and DNA damage/repair of the three kinds of cells when exposed to BaP .	
20364579_s3	RESULTS There was pol beta deletion in pol beta -/- cells and the level of pol beta mRNA and protein in pol beta oe cells was twice higher than that in pol beta +/+ cells .	
20364579_s4	BaP could induce DNA damage and reduce cell viability , when compared with pol beta +/+ cells , IC50 of pol beta -/- cells was remarkably lower , DNA was prone to damage and more difficult to be repaired , on the other hand , IC50 of pol beta oe cells was obviously higher and the damage effect on DNA was weaker and prone to be repaired .	genomic instability and mutation
20364579_s5	CONCLUSION Pol beta played an important role in the repair of DNA damage induced by BaP , deficiency of pol beta could decrease the DNA repair capability of cells , and overexpression of pol beta could help cells response to DNA damage and protect cells from death in a certain degree .	genomic instability and mutation
20368693_s0	The tumor suppressor LKB1 is inactivated in 90% of Peutz-Jeghers cancer syndrome , 30-40% of non-small cell lung carcinoma , and a variety of other cancers , indicating the loss of LKB1 activity is a critical step in oncogenesis .	
20368693_s1	However , current understanding of LKB1 function is largely limited to the results from cancer cells , and how LKB1 inactivation initiates malignant transformation in normal cells remains unclear .	
20368693_s2	Here we ablated endogenous expression of LKB1 in two normal cell lines : human embryonic kidney 293T cells ( HEK-293T cells ) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) by LKB1-specific short hairpin RNAs .	
20368693_s3	Downregulation of endogenous LKB1 lead to a facilitated G(1)/S transition , accompanied by a concomitant increase in Rb phosphorylation ( Ser(807/811) ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20368693_s4	Furthermore , reduced expression of p53 and p16 was observed in LKB1 ablated cells , while no differences were detected for cyclin D1 and cyclin E. These results jointly suggest that endogenous LKB1 knockdown accelerates cell cycle progression through G(1)/S checkpoint in HEK-293T cells and HUVECs , which is at least in part , mediated by decline of p53 and p16 pathways .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20368693_s5	Our findings provided a plausible mechanism by which loss of LKB1 expression in normal cells contributes to the formation of malignancies .	
20372058_s0	Although contact inhibition is a fundamental process for multicellular organisms , how proliferation is inhibited at high cellular densities remains poorly characterized .	
20372058_s1	Here we show that 4E-BP1 , one major repressor of cap-dependent translation , plays a critical role in density-mediated cell cycle arrest. 4E-BP1 promoter is activated and 4E-BP1 protein amount increases as cells reach confluence .	
20372058_s2	Conversely , a much less marked density-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation is observed upon 4E-BP1 silencing .	
20372058_s3	We further show that at high density , progression through the Gâ phase of the cell cycle is faster and Cyclin D1 protein is induced in different cell types where 4E-BP1 has been either downregulated ( stable shRNA expression or transient siRNA transfection ) or removed ( knock-out ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20372058_s4	Thus 4E-BP1 appears as an important mediator of contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
20378992_s0	The development and progression of esophageal cancer is associated with multiple alterations in the genome , including loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from the chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) gene .	
20378992_s1	The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of adenovirus-mediated MMAC/PTEN expression on the growth and survival of human esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo .	
20378992_s2	We found that compared to control cells , overexpression of PTEN significantly suppressed growth and induced apoptosis in esophageal cancer cell lines Eca-109 and TE-1 via downregulation of Bcl-2 expression and changes in cell-cycle progression .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20378992_s3	Adenovirus PTEN also inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumor xenografts by significantly reducing tumor size in vivo .	
20378992_s4	Thus our results confirm the proposed functional role of MMAC/PTEN as a regulator of esophageal cancer progression in vivo and in vitro .	
20378992_s5	PTEN might be an important biological marker and potential therapeutic target in the treatment of human esophageal cancer .	
20380798_s0	OBJECTIVE To study the effect of anandamide ( AEA ) on necrosis in HepG2 cells and to explore the role of AEA in progression of liver cancer .	
20380798_s1	METHODS Localization of the fatty acid hydrolytic enzyme ( FAAH ) , cannabinoid receptors 1(CB1) and cannabinoid receptors 2 ( CB2 ) proteins was detected in L02 and HepG2 cells using immunofluorescence .	
20380798_s2	L02 and HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations of AEA and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin , and the rates of cells necrosis were examined by PI stain .	
20380798_s3	Meanwhile , the expression levels of FAAH , CB1 and CB2 receptor proteins , as well as P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p-P38 MAPK ) and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase ( p-JNK ) proteins , were analyzed by Western blot .	
20380798_s4	RESULTS The FAAH , CB1 and CB2 receptor proteins were observed both in cytoplasm and on membrane in L02 and HepG2 cells .	
20380798_s5	The expression level of FAAH protein was higher in HepG2 than in L02 cells .	
20380798_s6	The expression level of CB1 receptor protein was very low in both L02 and HepG2 cells .	
20380798_s7	The expression level of CB2 receptor protein was high in both L02 and HepG2 cells .	
20380798_s8	AEA treatment induced necrosis in HepG2 cells but not in L02 cells .	resisting cell death
20380798_s9	Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin treatment prevented necrosis in HepG2 cells ( t = 3.702 ; 5.274 ; 3.503 , P less than 0.05 ) .	resisting cell death
20380798_s10	The expression patterns of FAAH , CB1 and CB2 receptor protein in L02 and HepG2 cells were confirmed by western blot , which were consistent with the immunofluorescence results .	
20380798_s11	AEA treatment increased the levels of p-P38MAPK and p-JNK proteins in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells ( F = 11.908 ; 26.054 , P less than 0.05 ) and the increase can be partially by prevented by MCD ( t = 2.801 ; t = 12.829 , P less than 0.05 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20380798_s12	CONCLUSION AEA treatment induces necrosis in HepG2 cells via CB1 and CB2 receptors and lipid rafts .	resisting cell death
20385015_s0	BACKGROUND Elevated levels of air pollution are associated with increased risk of lung cancer .	
20385015_s1	Particulate matter ( PM ) contains transition metals that may potentiate neoplastic development through the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation , a lung cancer risk factor .	
20385015_s2	Vanadium pentoxide ( V2O5 ) is a component of PM derived from fuel combustion as well as a source of occupational exposure in humans .	
20385015_s3	In the current investigation we examined the influence of genetic background on susceptibility to V2O5-induced inflammation and evaluated whether V2O5 functions as a tumor promoter using a 2-stage ( initiation-promotion ) model of pulmonary neoplasia in mice .	
20385015_s4	RESULTS A/J , BALB/cJ ( BALB ) , and C57BL/6J ( B6 ) mice were treated either with the initiator 3-methylcholanthrene ( MCA ; 10 microg/g ; i.p. ) or corn oil followed by 5 weekly aspirations of V2O5 or PBS and pulmonary tumors were enumerated 20 weeks following MCA treatment .	
20385015_s5	Susceptibility to V2O5-induced pulmonary inflammation was assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) , and chemokines , transcription factor activity , and MAPK signaling were quantified in lung homogenates .	
20385015_s6	We found that treatment of animals with MCA followed by V2O5 promoted lung tumors in both A/J ( 10.3 +/- 0.9 tumors/mouse ) and BALB ( 2.2 +/- 0.36 ) mice significantly above that observed with MCA/PBS or V2O5 alone ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
20385015_s7	No tumors were observed in the B6 mice in any of the experimental groups .	
20385015_s8	Mice sensitive to tumor promotion by V2O5 were also found to be more susceptible to V2O5-induced pulmonary inflammation and hyperpermeability ( A/J&gt;BALB&gt;B6 ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
20385015_s9	Differential strain responses in inflammation were positively associated with elevated levels of the chemokines KC and MCP-1 , higher NFkappaB and c-Fos binding activity , as well as sustained ERK1/2 activation in lung tissue .	tumor promoting inflammation
20385015_s10	CONCLUSIONS In this study we demonstrate that V2O5 , an occupational and environmentally relevant metal oxide , functions as an in vivo lung tumor promoter among different inbred strains of mice .	
20385015_s11	Further , we identified a positive relationship between tumor promotion and susceptibility to V2O5-induced pulmonary inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
20385015_s12	These findings suggest that repeated exposures to V2O5 containing particles may augment lung carcinogenesis in susceptible individuals through oxidative stress mediated pathways .	tumor promoting inflammation
20389038_s0	The mechanisms of formation of sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs ) and chromosome aberrations following inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by 3-aminobenzamide were studied in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines deficient in different repair pathways .	
20389038_s1	The results confirm earlier findings that ( a ) the ' spontaneous ' SCEs are formed due to the incorporated BrdU in the DNA , ( b ) ' spontaneous ' and induced SCEs originate from different mechanisms , and ( c ) SCEs and chromatid exchanges are formed by different pathways .	genomic instability and mutation
20389043_s0	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) such as dibenzo[a,l]pyrene ( DBP ) are wide-spread environmental pollutants most probably mutagenic and carcinogenic to humans .	
20389043_s1	Detailed data on the cytogenetic effects of anti-11,12-dihydroxy-13,14-epoxy-11,12,13,14-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,l]pyrene ( DBPDE ) in mammalian cells are not available in the literature .	
20389043_s2	The aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the induction of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs ) by DBPDE in mammalian cells .	
20389043_s3	In order to achieve this a parental ( AA8 ) and different DNA repair-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell lines such as UV4 , UV5 , UV61 ( nucleotide excision repair , NER ) , EM9 ( base excision repair , BER ) , irs1SF ( homologous recombination repair , HRR ) and V3-3 ( non-homologous end joining , NHEJ ) were used .	
20389043_s4	The most sensitive cell lines for DBPDE-induced chromosome aberrations were EM9 and irs1SF , while EM9 and V3-3 cell lines were the most sensitive in terms of SCEs induction .	
20389043_s5	It can be suggested that the BER pathway plays an important role in the repair of lesions induced by DBPDE , affecting both chromosomal aberrations and SCEs induction .	genomic instability and mutation
20389043_s6	Moreover , the HRR pathway seems to play a role in cellular resistance to DBPDE mainly in terms of chromosomal aberration induction while the NHEJ pathway takes part affecting only the induction of SCEs .	genomic instability and mutation
20391138_s0	Bulky DNA adducts are considered a potential biomarker of cancer risk .	
20391138_s1	In this study , the association between various lifestyle , environmental , and genetic factors and the levels of bulky DNA adducts in peripheral leukocytes was examined in a study group nested within a population-based prospective Danish cohort .	
20391138_s2	At enrollment , blood samples were collected and information on lifestyle , including dietary and smoking habits , obtained .	
20391138_s3	Previously , bulky DNA adducts were measured in 245 individuals who developed lung cancer and 255 control members of the cohort .	
20391138_s4	Of these 500 individuals , data on 375 individuals were included in this study , excluding 125 cases , which developed lung cancer within the first 3 yr after blood sampling .	
20391138_s5	Bulky DNA adduct levels were measured by 32P-postlabeling technique and polymorphisms in carcinogen metabolism and DNA repair genes were determined .	
20391138_s6	Potential predictors of bulky DNA adduct levels were analyzed by univariate and multivariate regression analyses .	
20391138_s7	Women tended to have higher adduct levels than men .	genomic instability and mutation
20391138_s8	Living in central Copenhagen and surface darkness of fried meat and fish were associated with quantitative higher adduct levels .	genomic instability and mutation
20391138_s9	No significant associations were found between dietary factors or smoking and DNA adduct levels .	genomic instability and mutation
20391138_s10	Further , the results showed no prominent associations between any of 12 genetic polymorphisms and adduct levels .	genomic instability and mutation
20391138_s11	Overall , our study showed only few associations between dietary , environmental , and genetic factors and levels of bulky DNA adducts measured in peripheral leukocytes in a general Danish population .	genomic instability and mutation
20392992_s0	BACKGROUND AND AIM The importance of glycolysis in cancer cells is well documented .	
20392992_s1	The effects of inhibiting glycolysis using metabolic inhibitors iodoacetate ( IAA ) , an inhibitor of GAPDHase , and 3-bromopyruvate ( 3BP ) , an inhibitor of hexokinase-II , on survival and signaling of pancreatic cancer cells ( Panc-1 ) were investigated .	
20392992_s2	MATERIALS AND METHODS Cellular survival was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay .	
20392992_s3	Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) assay was used to analyze the induced necrosis and protein levels were evaluated using Western blot analysis .	
20392992_s4	RESULTS The results show that the inhibitors lowered cellular survival and increased cellular necrosis .	resisting cell death
20392992_s5	Mitogenic signaling pathways were affected by 3BP but not by IAA .	
20392992_s6	CONCLUSION We conclude that there may be a cross-talk between signaling pathways and glycolysis in regulating pancreatic cancer cell survival and signaling .	cellular energetics
20392992_s7	Thus , a combination of agents that inhibit both energy production and cell signaling may provide a novel and effective approach to target pancreatic cancer effectively .	
20398195_s0	Thyroid-like low-grade nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma ( LGNPPA ) is extremely rare ; only four cases have been reported .	
20398195_s1	Herein are presented the case reports of two Japanese male patients with thyroid-like LGNPPA .	
20398195_s2	Macroscopically , these tumors were pedunculated polypoid masses on the roof of the nasopharynx .	
20398195_s3	Microscopically , they were characterized by papillary and glandular epithelial proliferation .	
20398195_s4	The papillae were complex and tightly packed with hyalinized fibrovascular cores and lined by columnar and pseudostratified cells with intervening spindle-shaped cells .	
20398195_s5	Both cell types had round to oval vesicular nuclei with tiny nucleoli and mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm .	
20398195_s6	Mitotic figures were not evident and necrosis was not observed .	resisting cell death
20398195_s7	Psammoma bodies were seen focally in one of the patients .	
20398195_s8	Transition from normal surface epithelium to tumor cells was identified in both cases .	
20398195_s9	On immunohistochemistry the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin ( CK)7 , CK19 , thyroid transcription factor-1 ( TTF-1 ) and vimentin .	
20398195_s10	They were negative for CK5/6 , CK20 , thyroglobulin , S-100 protein and CD15 .	
20398195_s11	In situ hybridization for EBV was negative .	
20398195_s12	Nasopharyngeal tumors with similar morphological appearance should be examined for TTF-1 immunoreactivity , and patients should be clinically followed to determine the course of this unusual disease and the significance of TTF-1 expression .	
20406967_s0	We studied the effect of the immune system on two differentially aggressive melanomas developing in mice on conditional deletion of the INK4A/ARF tumor suppressor gene , with concomitant expression of oncogene H-Ras(G12V) and a natural cancer-germline tumor antigen ( TA ) .	
20406967_s1	" Slow progressor " melanomas contained no activated T lymphocytes ( TL ) .	
20406967_s2	In contrast , " aggressive " melanomas were infiltrated by activated TLs lacking effector molecules and expressing high levels of PD-1 , indicating an exhausted phenotype .	
20406967_s3	Aggressive melanomas were also infiltrated by immature myeloid cells ( IMC ) .	
20406967_s4	Infiltration was associated with local inflammation and systemic Th2/Th17-oriented chronic inflammation that seemed to impair further activation of TLs , as tumor-specific T cells adoptively transferred into mice bearing aggressive melanomas were poorly activated and failed to infiltrate the melanoma .	tumor promoting inflammation
20406967_s5	This immunosuppression also led to the incapacity of these mice to reject inoculated TA-positive tumors , in contrast to slow-progressing melanoma-bearing mice , which were responsive .	avoiding immune destruction
20406967_s6	To test the role of adaptive immunity in tumor progression , we induced melanomas in immunodeficient RagKO compound mice .	tumor promoting inflammation
20406967_s7	These mice developed aggressive but not slow-progressing melanomas at a higher frequency and with a shorter latency than immunocompetent mice .	
20406967_s8	Immunodeficient mice also developed abnormal inflammation and infiltration of IMCs in a manner similar to immunocompetent mice , indicating that this phenotype was not dependent on adaptive immunity .	tumor promoting inflammation
20406967_s9	Therefore , tumor-intrinsic factors distinguishing the two melanoma types control the initiation of inflammation , which was independent of adaptive immunity .	tumor promoting inflammation
20406967_s10	The latter delayed development of aggressive melanomas but was overridden by inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
20417553_s0	Polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) are ubiquitous contaminants in the marine environment .	
20417553_s1	Their toxicity is mainly linked to the ability of marine species to biotransform them into reactive metabolites .	
20417553_s2	PAHs are thus often detected at trace levels in animal tissues .	
20417553_s3	For biomonitoring purposes , this findings have two main consequences , ( i ) the determination of the PAH tissue concentration is not suitable for the evaluation of individual exposure to PAHs ( ii ) it can explain sometimes the lack of correlations obtained with relevant markers of toxicity such as genotoxicity biomarkers .	
20417553_s4	The aim of the present study was to better investigate the link between PAH exposure and genotoxicity in marine flatfish .	
20417553_s5	During a laboratory experiment , juvenile soles were exposed for four weeks to a mixture of three PAHs , namely benzo[a]pyrene , fluoranthene and pyrene , followed by one week of depuration .	
20417553_s6	Fish were exposed via the trophic route to a daily PAH concentration of 120 Î¼g/g food .	
20417553_s7	Fish were sampled at different time points .	
20417553_s8	The bioavailability and the biotransformation of PAHs were assessed by the measurement of biliary metabolites using a sensitive UPLC MS/MS method .	
20417553_s9	The 7-ethoxyresorufine-O-deethylase was also measured in liver subcellular fractions as a biomarker of phase I biotransformation activities .	
20417553_s10	Genotoxicity was assessed in parallel by the measurement of DNA strand breaks in fish erythrocytes by the alkaline comet assay .	genomic instability and mutation
20417553_s11	During this study , the high amount of PAH metabolites produced in sole demonstrated the bioavailability of PAHs and their biotransformation by fish enzymes .	
20417553_s12	A positive correlation was observed between the level of hydroxylated PAH metabolites and genotoxicity as measured by the alkaline comet assay .	genomic instability and mutation
20420190_s0	Oxazaphosphorines are a class of DNA alkylating agents .	
20420190_s1	The aim of the present study was to compare the possible influence of three new generation oxazaphosphorines , D-17272 ( mafosfamide cyclohexylamine salt ) , D-18864 ( 4-hydro-peroxy-cyclophosphamide ) , and D-19575 ( glufosfamide , beta-D-glucose-isophosphoramide mustard ) on DNA damage induction in the human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells .	
20420190_s2	The flow cytometry APO-BRDU assay , based on the TUNEL method , was used for the in situ detection of DNA strand breaks .	
20420190_s3	After exposure of U937 cells to the oxazaphosphorines , the patterns of temporary changes in the frequency of TUNEL positive U937 cells , expressing DNA breakage , were determined .	genomic instability and mutation
20420190_s4	The effects of the oxazaphosphorines on U937 cells were dependent on the agent tested and its dose , and the time intervals after the drug application .	
20420190_s5	The different potential of D-17272 , D-18864 and D-19575 to induce DNA strand breakage in the human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells was shown .	genomic instability and mutation
20422865_s0	BACKGROUND/AIMS Adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder is a highly malignant neoplasm. p16 is a tumor suppressor gene protein , which is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that regulates the G1-S phase of the cell cycle .	
20422865_s1	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the expression of p16 in gallbladder carcinoma and its precancerous conditions and to examine the relationship between p16 expression and clinicopathological parameters .	
20422865_s2	METHODOLOGY Formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 20 cases of normal gallbladder , 20 cases of chronic cholecystitis , 20 cases of gallbladder adenoma , 20 cases of dysplasia , and 58 cases of adenocarcinoma were examined .	
20422865_s3	The expression of p16 was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis .	
20422865_s4	RESULTS In normal gallbladder , no expression of p16 was found .	
20422865_s5	In chronic cholecystitis , expression of p16 was not found .	
20422865_s6	In gallbladder adenomas , expression of p16 was found in 20% ( 4/20 ) .	
20422865_s7	In low grade dyspalsias , expression of p16 was not found .	
20422865_s8	In high grade dysplasias , p16 expression was present in 45.0% ( 9/20 ) .	evading growth suppressors
20422865_s9	In gallbladder adenocarcinomas , p16 expression was found in 27.6% ( 16/58 ) .	evading growth suppressors
20422865_s10	Expression of p16 correlated significantly with histologic grade ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	evading growth suppressors
20422865_s11	No correlation was found between p16 expression and age , gender , tumor size , gross type , location , vascular invasion , lymph node metastasis , and TNM stage , respectively .	evading growth suppressors
20422865_s12	CONCLUSIONS P16 protein overexpression is an early and relatively common event in carcinogenesis of gallbladder carcinoma .	evading growth suppressors
20422865_s13	Expression of p16 protein is absent in normal or chronic cholecystitis .	
20422865_s14	Expression of p16 may be an ancillary diagnostic marker of gallbladder carcinoma and its precancerous conditions .	
20422883_s0	BACKGROUND/AIMS The use of chemotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma is still controversial .	
20422883_s1	The aim of this study was to investigate whether the combined use of epirubicin and progesterone has a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis in HepG2 cells .	
20422883_s2	METHODOLOGY Different concentrations of epirubicin ( 0.1 microg/ml , 0.25 microg/ml and 0.5microg/ml ) or progesterone ( 12.5 microM , 25 microM and 50 microM ) were added to HepG2 cells either alone or in combinations consisting of different concentrations of the two .	
20422883_s3	Their effects on HepG2 cells were studied by ( 1 ) XTT assay for analysis of cell proliferation , ( 2 ) 3H-Thymidine incorporation for DNA synthesis , ( 3 ) annexin V-FITC/ propidium iodide ( PI ) flowcytometery for cell apoptosis , ( 4 ) flowcytometry for cell cycle distributions , and ( 5 ) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for expression of cell cycle modulator , cyclin D1 .	
20422883_s4	RESULTS 50 microM progesterone increased both the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of 0.1 microg/ml epirubicin on HepG2 cells at 48 hr culture due to 50 microM progesterone accumulated cells in S phase of the cell cycle and subsequently reduced cyclin D1 expression .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20422883_s5	These effects on HepG2 cells induced by this combination were comparable to those induced by 0.5 microg/ml epirubicin alone .	
20422883_s6	CONCLUSIONS In vitro , progesterone can increase the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by epirubicin on HepG2 cells .	
20423312_s0	Among several types of DNA lesions , the DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) are one of the most deleterious and harmful .	
20423312_s1	Mammalian cells mount a coordinated response to DSBs with the aim of appropriately repair the DNA damage .	
20423312_s2	Indeed , failure of the DNA damage response ( DDR ) can lead to the development of cancer-prone genetic diseases .	
20423312_s3	The identification and development of drugs targeting proteins involved in the DDR is even more investigated , as it gives the possibility to specifically target cancer cells .	
20423312_s4	Indeed , the administration of DNA repair inhibitors could be combined with chemo- and radiotherapy , thus improving the eradication of tumor cells .	
20423312_s5	Here , we provide an overview about DSBs damage response , focusing on the role of the DSBs repair mechanisms , of chromatin modifications , and of the cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 which plays a multifunctional role in controlling genome integrity .	genomic instability and mutation
20423312_s6	Moreover , the most investigated DSBs enzyme inhibitors tested as potential therapeutic agents for anti-cancer therapy are reported .	
20429312_s0	OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to examine the expression of MCM-2 and conventional proliferation marker Ki-67 in breast carcinoma by stereologic technique and to compare it with various clinicopathologic parameters .	
20429312_s1	METHODS The expression of MCM-2 and Ki-67 on paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections of patients with invasive breast carcinoma was analyzed immunohistochemically .	
20429312_s2	Stereologic method was used for evaluation of the percentage of positively stained tumor cells .	
20429312_s3	RESULTS Significant positive correlation was found between the expression of MCM-2 and that of Ki-67 ( r = 0.74 , p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20429312_s4	MCM-2 and Ki-67 expression was significantly associated with histologic grade ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) , and negative correlation was observed between MCM-2 or Ki-67 expression and estrogen status ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20429312_s5	No significant association was observed between MCM-2 or Ki-67 expression and patient age , tumor size , lymph node status , clinical stage and menopausal status .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20429312_s6	CONCLUSION Our results suggest that MCM-2 expression is significantly associated with histologic grade of breast carcinoma and with cell proliferation capacity ( Ki-67 labelling index ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20429312_s7	Additional studies are required using the stereologic method to compare and understand the utility of Ki-67 and MCM-2 expression in invasive breast carcinoma ( Tab. 1 , Fig. 4 , Ref. 34 ) .

20432174_s0	Recent surveys indicate that Pi intake has increased steadily as Pi-containing foods have increased .	
20432174_s1	Our previous study demonstrated that high dietary Pi strongly stimulated lung tumorigeneis .	
20432174_s2	In order to answer the issue whether low Pi may be chemopreventive , we examined the effects of low Pi on lung cancer .	
20432174_s3	Eighteen 5-wk-old male K-ras(LA1) lung cancer model mice were randomly allocated to 2 groups .	
20432174_s4	One group was fed a normal diet ( 0.5% Pi ) and other group was fed low Pi ( 0.1% Pi ) diet for 4 wk .	
20432174_s5	Lung cancer development was evaluated by histopathological examination , Western blot , kinase assay , and immunohistochemistry .	
20432174_s6	Low Pi increased the expression of sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporter 2b , and activated Akt signal with decreased PTEN expression in the lungs of K-ras(LA1) mice .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20432174_s7	Low Pi increased the Akt/mTOR-mediated protein translation through upregulating the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20432174_s8	In addition , low Pi stimulated cell cycling as evidenced by altered cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1 and D3 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20432174_s9	Finally , low Pi increased lung tumorigenesis in K-ras(LA1) mice compared to the normal diet group .	
20432174_s10	Our results clearly demonstrated that low Pi also promoted lung tumorigenesis , thus suggesting that an appropriate intake of dietary Pi may be critical for lung cancer prevention as well as treatment .	
20442453_s0	Caveolin-1 ( -/- ) null stromal cells are a novel genetic model for cancer-associated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts .	
20442453_s1	Here , we used an unbiased informatics analysis of transcriptional gene profiling to show that Cav-1 ( -/- ) bone-marrow derived stromal cells bear a striking resemblance to the activated tumor stroma of human breast cancers .	
20442453_s2	More specifically , the transcriptional profiles of Cav-1 ( -/- ) stromal cells were most closely related to the primary tumor stroma of breast cancer patients that had undergone lymph-node ( LN ) metastasis .	
20442453_s3	This is consistent with previous morphological data demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 protein ( by immuno-histochemical staining in the fibroblast compartment ) is significantly associated with increased LN-metastasis .	
20442453_s4	We also provide evidence that the tumor stroma of human breast cancers shows a transcriptional shift towards oxidative stress , DNA damage/repair , inflammation , hypoxia , and aerobic glycolysis , consistent with the " Reverse Warburg Effect " .	cellular energetics,genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
20442453_s5	Finally , the tumor stroma of " metastasis-prone " breast cancer patients was most closely related to the transcriptional profiles derived from the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease .	
20442453_s6	This suggests that certain fundamental biological processes are common to both an activated tumor stroma and neuro-degenerative stress .	
20442453_s7	These processes may include oxidative stress , NO over-production ( peroxynitrite formation ) , inflammation , hypoxia , and mitochondrial dysfunction , which are thought to occur in Alzheimer?s disease pathology .	
20442453_s8	Thus , a loss of Cav-1 expression in cancer-associated myofibroblasts may be a protein biomarker for oxidative stress , aerobic glycolysis , and inflammation , driving the " Reverse Warburg Effect " in the tumor micro-environment and cancer cell metastasis .	cellular energetics,tumor promoting inflammation
20448329_s0	BACKGROUND CDC4/FBXW7 , encoding a ubiquitin ligase , maps to 4q32 and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene and therapeutic target in many tumor types .	
20448329_s1	Mutations in colonic adenomas , and the frequent losses on 4q described in gastric cancer prompt speculation about the role of CDC4/FBXW7 in gastric carcinogenesis .	
20448329_s2	METHODS We assessed the role of CDC4/FBXW7 in gastric cancer , through loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ( MLPA ) on 47 flow-sorted gastric carcinomas including early-onset gastric cancers ( EOGC ) and xenografted conventional gastric carcinomas .	
20448329_s3	Ploidy analysis was carried out on 39 EOGCs and immunohistochemistry of CDC4/FBXW7 and its substrates c-myc , c-jun , Notch and cyclin E was performed on 204 gastric carcinomas using tissue microarrays ( TMAs ) .	
20448329_s4	Sequence analysis of CDC4/FBXW7 was carried out on gastric carcinoma cell lines and xenografts .	
20448329_s5	RESULTS Loss of heterozygosity of CDC4/FBXW7 occurred in 32% of EOGCs , and correlated with loss of expression in 26% .	genomic instability and mutation
20448329_s6	Loss of expression was frequent in both EOGC and conventional gastric cancers .	genomic instability and mutation
20448329_s7	No CDC4/FBXW7 mutations were found and loss of CDC4/FBXW7 did not correlate with ploidy status .	genomic instability and mutation
20448329_s8	There was a significant correlation between loss of CDC4/FBXW7 expression and upregulation of c-myc .	genomic instability and mutation
20448329_s9	CONCLUSION Loss of CDC4/FBXW7 appears to play a role in both EOGC and conventional gastric carcinogenesis , and c-myc overexpression is likely to be an important oncogenic consequence of CDC4/FBXW7 loss .	
20448413_s0	XRCC4 , in association with DNA ligase IV , is thought to play a critical role in the ligation of two DNA ends in DNA double-strand break ( DSB ) repair through non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) pathway .	
20448413_s1	In the present study , we captured radiation-induced chromatin-recruitment of XRCC4 by biochemical fractionation using detergent Nonidet P-40 .	
20448413_s2	A subpopulation of XRCC4 changed into a form that is resistant to the extraction with 0.5% Nonidet P-40-containing buffer after irradiation .	
20448413_s3	This form of XRCC4 was liberated by micrococcal nuclease treatment , indicating that it had been tethered to chromatin DNA .	
20448413_s4	This chromatin-recruitment of XRCC4 could be seen immediately ( &lt ; 0.1 hr ) after irradiation and remained up to 4 hr after 20 Gy irradiation .	
20448413_s5	It was seen even after irradiation of small doses , i.e. , 2 Gy , but the residence of XRCC4 on chromatin was very transient after 2 Gy irradiation , returning to near normal level in 0.2-0.5 hr after irradiation .	
20448413_s6	The chromatin-bound XRCC4 represented only approximately 1% of total XRCC4 molecules even after 20 Gy irradiation and the quantitative analysis using purified protein as the reference suggested that only a few XRCC4-DNA ligase IV complexes were recruited to each DNA end .	genomic instability and mutation
20448413_s7	We further show that the chromatin-recruitment of XRCC4 was not attenuated by wortmannin , an inhibitor of DNA-PK , or siRNA-mediated knockdown of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit ( DNA-PKcs ) , indicating that this process does not require DNA-PKcs .	
20448413_s8	These results would provide us with useful experimental tools and important insights to understand the DNA repair process through NHEJ pathway .	genomic instability and mutation

20450762_s2	Immunohistochemical study for vimentin , MSA , SMA , calponin , h-caldesmon , desmin , ALK , fibronectin , CK , S-100 and Ki-67 was carried out .	
20450762_s3	Ultrastructural examination was also performed in two of the cases .	
20450762_s4	RESULTS The patients age ranged from 28 to 62 years ( mean = 43 years ) .	
20450762_s5	The male-to-female ratio was 2:3 .	
20450762_s6	The clinical presentation included nasal obstruction , nasal discharge , nasal bleeding , facial pain , facial swelling , toothache and tear overflow .	
20450762_s7	All of the 5 patients suffered from disease relapses ; and 4 of them had recurrences for more than 5 times .	
20450762_s8	One patient had lymph node metastasis and 3 patients died of the disease .	activating invasion and metastasis
20450762_s9	Histologically , the tumor cells were arranged in interlacing fascicles and sometimes haphazard in fashion .	
20450762_s10	They were spindly in shape , cytoplasm eosinophilic with mild nuclear atypia and a low mitotic activity .	
20450762_s11	The intervening stroma was myxoid in appearance accompanied by lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration , abundant blood vessels and focal collagenized areas .	
20450762_s12	In 3 of the recurrent cases , the tumor cells displayed increased nuclear atypia and mitotic activity ( average about 5 to 6 per 10 high-power fields ) , accompanied by patchy necrosis , less inflammatory cell infiltration and focal sarcomatous changes .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20450762_s13	Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for vimentin .	
20450762_s14	SMA , MSA , calponin and fibronectin were variably expressed .	
20450762_s15	Desmin was weakly positive in 1 case .	
20450762_s16	The staining for h-caldesmon , ALK , S-100 and CK was negative .	
20450762_s17	The Ki-67 proliferation index increased with tumor recurrences .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20450762_s18	Electron microscopy revealed abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and dense body formation in the cytoplasm .	
20450762_s19	There were an increased amount of collagen fibers in the stroma .	
20450762_s20	CONCLUSIONS IMT rarely occurs in nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses .	
20450762_s21	The tumor is prone to local invasion and recurrences , with subsequent progression to frank malignancy and distant metastasis , resulting in high mortality and poor prognosis .	
20450762_s22	Complete surgical resection remains the main modality of treatment .	
20460749_s0	Recent research has shown that the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit is a novel anti-cancer target , which plays pivotal roles in malignant cell ion transport , metabolism , migration and signal transduction .	
20460749_s1	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the anti-cancer effects of ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 small interfering ribonucleic acid ( siRNA ) on HepG2 cell proliferation , apoptosis and cell cycle , and to explore the molecular mechanisms .	
20460749_s2	The expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , normal liver tissues and human HCC line ( HepG2 , SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402 ) has been investigated .	
20460749_s3	Using the ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit siRNA , which target the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase , we have evaluated the effects of inhibiting Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 in human HepG2 cells with respect to cell proliferation , morphology , cell cycle , impact on intracellular Ca2++ , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) concentration , and correlated gene expression level on messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) and protein .	
20460749_s4	Our data showed that the expression Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in HCC tissues is higher than that in normal liver tissues .	
20460749_s5	Ouabain and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 siRNA could inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation .	
20460749_s6	Ouabain could induce HepG2 cell apoptosis and generate S phase arrest , and siRNA could enhance the anti-cancer effect of ouabain that induced HepG2 cells apoptosis via an intracellular Ca(2+) and ROS increase-mediated , and generated cell cycle S phase arresting by decreasing the CyclinA1/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2)/proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) complex product and increasing the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A ( P21(CIP1) ) .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20460749_s7	We believe that targeting of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in human HCC cells could provide new sight into the treatment of HCC .	
20463594_s0	Squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) is the most frequent cancer in organ transplant recipients ( OTRs ) .	
20463594_s1	The immune system plays a major role in the fight against SCC , however , little is known about the local inflammatory response in SCC at all .	
20463594_s2	We analyzed quantity and quality of the perineoplastic inflammatory SCC microenvironment in immunocompetent patients and immmunosuppressed OTRs .	
20463594_s3	RNA expression profile of SCC patients was analyzed for 8 different sets of genes relating to Th1 versus Th2 response using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis .	
20463594_s4	SCC from immunocompetent patients and OTRs were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reactions for CD4 , CD8 , TBET , GATA-3 , FOXP3 , RORC , IFN-gamma , IL-4 , TGF-beta , IL-10 , and IL-17A mRNA expression .	
20463594_s5	Immunohistochemistry was carried out in SCC for CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , and FOXP3 expression .	
20463594_s6	Considerable inflammation was seen in both patient groups .	tumor promoting inflammation
20463594_s7	SCC in immunocompetent patients and OTRs was associated with a mixed Th1 and Th2 gene expression signature .	avoiding immune destruction
20463594_s8	CD4(+) mRNA was diminished in immunosuppression .	avoiding immune destruction
20463594_s9	Skin adjacent to SCC in OTRs showed Th2 expression pattern as compared with immunocompetent patients .	avoiding immune destruction
20463594_s10	T-BET and IFN-gamma mRNA expression were decreased in the OTR group .	
20463594_s11	Although Th17-weighted inflammation was unchanged , IL-17A mRNA level was markedly decreased with immunosuppression .	avoiding immune destruction,tumor promoting inflammation
20463594_s12	Regulatory T cells , characterized by FOX-P3 and TGF-beta mRNA level , were decreased in OTRs .	
20463594_s13	Our findings support the hypothesis that nontumor-bearing skin adjacent to SCC in OTRs is not necessarily normal and that the local microenvironment may contribute to a field effect contributing to higher recurrence rates and more aggressive behavior observed in these patients .	
20464641_s0	Oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) is the most common malignant tumor in the oral and maxillofacial region .	
20464641_s1	The mechanism of carcinogenesis of OSCC is still unclear .	
20464641_s2	Based on the previous cell line , HIOEC-B(a)P-96 ( HB96 ) , which we obtained by HPV16 E6/E7-immortalized human oral epithelial cells ( HIOEC ) and benzo(a)pyrene inducement , we prepared a new HB-second generation cancer cell line ( HB-2 ) by continuous passage .	
20464641_s3	Its characteristics such as morphology , proliferation activity , karyotype , and tumorigenesis were studied .	
20464641_s4	The HB-2 cells displayed uncontrolled cell division and lost contact inhibition leading to cell overlap .	evading growth suppressors
20464641_s5	Cells were polygonal and unevenly shaped , with an increased nucleus versus plasma ratio .	
20464641_s6	Increased proliferative activity was confirmed by MTT assays .	
20464641_s7	The tumorigenicity was confirmed by tumor growth experiments in nude mice .	
20464641_s8	Therefore , the HB-2 and HB96 cell lines are useful tools to study the mechanism of carcinogenesis of OSCC in vitro for future genomic and proteomic analyses .	
20468007_s0	Regulation of adaptive immunity by innate immune cells is widely accepted .	
20468007_s1	Conversely , adaptive immune cells can also regulate cells of the innate immune system .	
20468007_s2	Here , we report for the first time the essential role of B cells in regulating macrophage ( MÏ ) phenotype .	
20468007_s3	In vitro B cell/MÏ co-culture experiments together with experiments in transgenic mice models for B-cell deficiency or overexpression showed B1 cells to polarize MÏ to a distinct phenotype .	
20468007_s4	This was characterized by downregulated TNF-Î± , IL-1Î² and CCL3 , but upregulated IL-10 upon LPS stimulation ; constitutive expression of M2 MÏ markers ( e.g .	
20468007_s5	Ym1 , Fizz1 ) and overexpression of TRIF-dependent cytokines ( IFN-Î² , CCL5 ) .	
20468007_s6	Mechanistically , this phenotype was linked to a defective NF-ÎºB activation , but a functional TRIF/STAT1 pathway .	
20468007_s7	B1-cell-derived IL-10 was found to be instrumental in the polarization of these MÏ .	
20468007_s8	Finally , in vivo relevance of B1-cell-induced MÏ polarization was confirmed using the B16 melanoma tumor model where adoptive transfer of B1 cells induced an M2 polarization of tumor-associated MÏ .	
20468007_s9	Collectively , our results define a new mechanism of MÏ polarization wherein B1 cells play a key role in driving MÏ to a unique , but M2-biased phenotype .	
20468007_s10	Future studies along these lines may lead to targeting of B1 cells to regulate MÏ response in inflammation and cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
20471162_s0	The effect of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) on Vero cell proliferation was investigated , with the attempts to assess the possible hormetic dose-response and to compare their structure-dependent toxicity .	
20471162_s1	Both PCB congeners revealed low doses stimulation in our experiment .	
20471162_s2	However , significant cytotoxicity was only observed in PCB 52 concentrations larger than 0.1 microg ml(-1) , while there was no significant inhibition in PCB 77-treated cells at concentrations selected .	
20471162_s3	Furthermore , the time-dependent cytotoxic trends were different .	
20471162_s4	The comparison between PCB 52 and PCB 77 indicated that the cytotoxic mechanisms involved in coplanar or non-coplanar PCB congener exposure were different , and this difference might be associated with individual genotoxicity and the release of contact inhibition , respectively .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
20482528_s0	Abstract The use of immunotherapeutics in melanoma has received much attention , and recent advances to further characterize the regulatory components of the immune system and the importance of co-stimulatory molecules have opened a new area for clinical investigation .	
20482528_s1	Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ) serves as a negative regulator of immunity .	
20482528_s2	Recent trials administering fully human anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies to melanoma patients have demonstrated clinically meaningful responses .	
20482528_s3	Treatment with CTLA-4 blocking antibodies , however , is not without potential toxicities .	
20482528_s4	Autoimmune side-effects , the most common being colitis-associated diarrhea , are frequently associated with clinical responses .	
20482528_s5	In efforts to build upon prior vaccination efforts as well as attempt to offer patients clinically meaningful immune responses with a CTLA-4 blockade but without significant toxicities , we conducted a clinical trial in patients who previously received autologous tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GVAX ; Cell Genesys , South San Francisco , CA , USA ) with periodic infusions of CTLA-4 blocking antibodies .	
20482528_s6	This sequential treatment resulted in clinically significant anti-tumor immunity without grade 3 or 4 toxicity in most patients .	
20482528_s7	Pathological analyses following treatment of pre-existing tumors revealed a linear correlation between tumor necrosis and the ratio of intra-tumoral CD8+ effector cells to FoxP3+ regulatory cells ( T(regs) ) .	avoiding immune destruction,resisting cell death
20482528_s8	Effective anti-tumor immunity and serious autoimmunity can be disassociated .	
20482528_s9	Further targeting of anti-tumor T(regs)in combinatorial therapy approaches may be a rich avenue of future investigation .	
20483759_s0	Pam3CSK4 , a synthetic TLR2 ligand , has been shown to expand CD4+ regulatory T cells ( Treg cells ) .	
20483759_s1	Less is known about the function of CD8+ Treg cells than about the function of CD4+ Treg cells generated during allergen-specific immunotherapy ( IT ) .	
20483759_s2	This study investigated whether Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus-specific IT could expand the CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg population and whether Pam3CSK4 could enhance the Treg population .	
20483759_s3	PBMCs were isolated from healthy control subjects and from mite-sensitive asthmatic patients during IT at three specific times : before IT and 6 mo and 1 y after the maximum-tolerated dose .	
20483759_s4	This study was performed without a placebo-controlled group .	
20483759_s5	D. pteronyssinus-specific IT induced a significant increase in CD8+Foxp3+ Treg cells expressing intracellular IL-10 and granzyme B. Costimulation of PBMCs with Pam3CSK4 and D. pteronyssinus 2 expanded the CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg population and inhibited D. pteronyssinus 2-induced IL-4 production .	
20483759_s6	Pam3CSK4-treated CD8+CD25+ Treg cells directly suppressed CD4+ T cell proliferation by cell-contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
20483759_s7	TUNEL revealed that CD8+CD25+ Treg cells , but not CD4+CD25+ Treg cells , directly induced CD4+CD45ROhi+ apoptosis .	resisting cell death
20483759_s8	Our results provide direct evidence that Pam3CSK4 induces an immunomodulatory effect by inducing CD8+ Treg cells ; therefore , it may be a good adjuvant for the treatment of mite allergies .	
20487216_s0	OBJECTIVES Toxicity caused by pharmacological and chemical substances , including carbon tetrachloride ( CCl(4) ) , is a major pathological factor for liver injury .	
20487216_s1	Therefore , strategies to prevent toxicity are needed for maintaining a healthy liver .	
20487216_s2	This study was designed to determine whether recombinant bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor ( rBPTI ) , a non-specific serine protease inhibitor , prevents CCl(4)-induced liver injury in mice .	
20487216_s3	METHODS Mice were treated with CCl(4) in the presence or absence of co-treatment with rBPTI .	
20487216_s4	Liver sections were prepared for histopathological assessment .	
20487216_s5	Liver function was evaluated by detecting serum levels of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and liver index .	
20487216_s6	Liver oxidative stress and inflammation were examined by detecting the liver malondialdehyde level and glutathione and superoxide dismutase activity , and serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha level , respectively .	
20487216_s7	KEY FINDINGS CCl(4) induced hepatocyte necrosis , inflammatory cell infiltration and fatty degeneration , which were ameliorated by co-treatment with rBPTI in a concentration-dependent manner .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20487216_s8	Furthermore , rBPTI prevented CCl(4)-induced disruption of liver function .	
20487216_s9	Importantly , rBPTI reduced CCl(4)-induced liver oxidative stress response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production .	tumor promoting inflammation
20487216_s10	CONCLUSIONS These results indicated that rBPTI exerted a protective effect on CCl(4)-induced liver injury in mice .	
20487216_s11	Thus , rBPTI may have potential application for prevention of liver injury induced by metabolism of drugs and toxic substances .	
20497549_s0	INTRODUCTION Necrosis at the tumor center is a common feature of aggressive breast cancers and has been associated with poor prognosis .	
20497549_s1	It is commonly identified by means of invasive histopathology , which often correlates with morbidity and potential tumor cell dissemination , and limits the reconstruction of the whole necrotic domain .	
20497549_s2	In this study we hypothesized that non covalent association to serum albumin ( SA ) and covalent binding to ligands for tumor-abundant cell receptors should synergistically drive selective accumulation and prolonged retention of imaging and therapeutic agents in breast tumor necrotic domains enabling in vivo identification , imaging and possibly treatment of such tumors .	
20497549_s3	METHODS Cyclo-Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys ( c(RGDfK) ) were conjugated to bacteriochlorophyll-derivatives ( Bchl-Ds ) , previously developed as photodynamic agents , fluorescent probes and metal chelators in our lab .	
20497549_s4	The c(RGDfK) component drives ligation to alphaVbeta3 integrin receptors over-expressed by tumor cells and neo-vessels , and the Bchl-D component associates to SA in a non-covalent manner .	
20497549_s5	STL-6014 , a c(RGDfK)-Bchl-D representative , was i.v. injected to CD-1 , nude female mice bearing necrotic and non-necrotic human MDA-MB-231-RFP breast cancer tumors .	
20497549_s6	The fluorescence signals of the Bchl-Ds and RFP were monitored over days after treatment , by quantitative whole body imaging and excised tumor/tissue samples derived thereof .	
20497549_s7	Complementary experiments included competitive inhibition of STL-6014 uptake by free c(RGDfK) , comparative pharmacokinetics of nonconjugated c(RGDfK) Bchl-D ( STL-7012 ) and of two human serum albumin ( HSA ) conjugates : HSA-STL-7012 and HSA-STL-6014 .	
20497549_s8	RESULTS STL-6014 and STL-7012 formed complexes with HSA ( HSA/STL-6014 , HSA/STL-7012 ) .	
20497549_s9	STL-6014 , HSA-STL-7012 and HSA-STL-6014 , selectively accumulated at similar rates , in tumor viable regions over the first 8 h post administration .	
20497549_s10	They then migrated into the necrotic tumor domain and presented tumor half lifetimes ( T1/2 ) in the range of days where T1/2 for HSA-STL-6014 &gt ; STL-6014 &gt ; HSA-STL-7012 .	
20497549_s11	No accumulation of STL-7012 was observed .	
20497549_s12	Pre-injection of c(RGDfK) excess , prevented the uptake of STL-6014 in the small , but not in the large tumors .	
20497549_s13	CONCLUSIONS Non-covalent association to SA and covalent binding to c(RGDfK) , synergistically enable the accumulation and prolonged retention of Bchl-Ds in the necrotic regions of tumors .	
20497549_s14	These findings provide novel guidelines and strategy for imaging and treatment of necrotic tumors .	resisting cell death
20501860_s0	Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , one of the most frequent and deadliest cancers , has been increasing considerably in the United States .	
20501860_s1	In the absence of a proven effective therapy for HCC , novel chemopreventive strategies are urgently needed to lower the current morbidity and mortality of HCC .	
20501860_s2	Recently , we have reported that resveratrol , a compound present in grapes and red wine , significantly prevents diethylnitrosamine ( DENA)-induced liver tumorigenesis in rats , although the mechanism of action is not completely understood .	
20501860_s3	In the present study , we have examined the underlying mechanisms of resveratrol chemoprevention of hepatocarcinogenesis by investigating the effects of resveratrol on oxidative damage and inflammatory markers during DENA-initiated rat liver carcinogenesis .	
20501860_s4	There was a significant increase in hepatic lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in carcinogen control animals compared with their normal counterparts at the end of the study ( 20 weeks ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
20501860_s5	Elevated expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase and 3-nitrotyrosine were noticed in the livers of the same animals .	
20501860_s6	Dietary resveratrol ( 50-300 mg/kg ) administered throughout the study reversed all the aforementioned markers in a dose-responsive fashion in rats challenged with DENA .	
20501860_s7	Resveratrol also elevated the protein and mRNA expression of hepatic nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) .	
20501860_s8	Results of the present investigation provide evidence that attenuation of oxidative stress and suppression of inflammatory response mediated by Nrf2 could be implicated , at least in part , in the chemopreventive effects of this dietary agent against chemically induced hepatic tumorigenesis in rats .	
20501860_s9	The outcome of this study may benefit the development of resveratrol in the prevention and intervention of human HCC .	
20511723_s0	By intravenous ( but not oral ) application of ascorbate , millimolar serum concentrations can be reached , which are preferentially cytotoxic to cancer cells .	
20511723_s1	Cytotoxicity is mediated by transition metal-dependent generation of H(2)O(2) in the interstitial space .	
20511723_s2	In this study , the sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells ( Kelly , SK-N-SH ) to ascorbate and H(2)O(2) and their defense mechanisms against H(2)O(2) were investigated .	
20511723_s3	Since aerobic glycolysis ( the Warburg effect ) is a feature of many tumour cells , their glucose consumption and lactate production were monitored .	
20511723_s4	Furthermore , synthesis and release of ferritin by neuroblastoma cells were analysed in order to examine whether ferritin is possibly an iron source for H(2)O(2) generation .	
20511723_s5	Ascorbate ( 0.6-5.0 mM ) and H(2)O(2) ( 25-100 muM ) were found to be similarly cytotoxic to Kelly and SK-N-SH cells .	
20511723_s6	In each case , cytotoxicity increased if cell concentrations decreased , in accordance with low cell concentrations having lower capacities to detoxify H(2)O(2) .	
20511723_s7	Kelly and SK-N-SH cells produced and released remarkable amounts of lactate and ferritin .	
20511723_s8	We propose the selective cytotoxicity of high dose ascorbate to tumour cells to be due to the preferential generation of H(2)O(2) in the acidic and ferritin-rich tumour microenvironment , combined with reduced defense systems against H(2)O(2) as a consequence of aerobic glycolysis .	cellular energetics
20514026_s0	The Ras-assocation domain family ( RASSF ) of tumor suppressor proteins until recently contained six proteins named RASSF1-6 .	
20514026_s1	Recently , four novel family members , RASSF7-10 , have been identified by homology searches for RA-domain-containing proteins .	
20514026_s2	These additional RASSF members are divergent and structurally distinct from RASSF1-6 , containing an N-terminal RA domain and lacking the Sav/RASSF/Hpo ( SARAH ) domain .	
20514026_s3	Here , we show that RASSF8 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the murine embryo and in normal human adult tissues .	
20514026_s4	Functionally , RNAi-mediated knockdown of RASSF8 in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines , increased anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and enhanced tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice .	
20514026_s5	Furthermore , EdU staining of RASSF8-depleted cells showed growth suppression in a manner dependent on contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
20514026_s6	We show that endogenous RASSF8 is not only found in the nucleus , but is also membrane associated at sites of cell-cell adhesion , co-localizing with the adherens junction ( AJ ) component beta-catenin and binding to E-cadherin .	
20514026_s7	Following RASSF8 depletion in two different lung cancer cell lines using alternative small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) sequences , we show that AJs are destabilized and E-cadherin is lost from the cell membrane .	
20514026_s8	The AJ components beta-catenin and p65 are also lost from sites of cell-cell contact and are relocalized to the nucleus with a concomitant increase in beta-catenin-dependent and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-kappaB)-dependent signaling following RASSF8 depletion .	
20514026_s9	RASSF8 may also be required to maintain actin -cytoskeletal organization since immunofluorescence analysis shows a striking disorganization of the actin- cytoskeleton following RASSF8 depletion .	
20514026_s10	Accordingly , scratch wound healing studies show increased cellular migration in RASSF8-deficient cells .	
20514026_s11	These results implicate RASSF8 as a tumor suppressor gene that is essential for maintaining AJs function in epithelial cells and have a role in epithelial cell migration .	
20525204_s0	INTRODUCTION A subpopulation of cancer cells , tumor-initiating cells , is believed to be the driving force behind tumorigenesis and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy .	
20525204_s1	The persistence of tumor-initiating cells may depend on altered regulation of DNA damage and checkpoint proteins , as well as a reduced propensity to undergo apoptosis or senescence .	
20525204_s2	METHODS To test this hypothesis , we isolated CD24-/low/CD44+ tumor-initiating cells ( as mammospheres ) from MCF-7 breast cancer cells grown in adherent monolayer culture , and carried out a comprehensive comparison of cell death and DNA damage response pathways prior to and after exposure to ionizing radiation in mammospheres and monolayer MCF-7 cells .	
20525204_s3	Single and double-strand break repair was measured by single-cell gel electrophoresis .	
20525204_s4	The latter was also examined by phosphorylation of histone H2AX and formation of 53BP1 and Rad51 foci .	
20525204_s5	Apoptosis was quantified by flow-cytometric analysis of annexin V-binding and senescence was analyzed on the basis of cellular beta-galactosidase activity .	
20525204_s6	We employed the telomeric repeat amplification protocol to quantify telomerase activity .	
20525204_s7	Expression of key DNA repair and cell cycle regulatory proteins was detected and quantified by western blot analysis .	
20525204_s8	RESULTS Our data demonstrate that in comparison to the bulk population of MCF-7 cells ( predominantly CD24+/CD44+ ) , the MCF-7 mammosphere cells benefit from a multifaceted approach to cellular protection relative to that seen in monolayer cells , including a reduced level of reactive oxygen species , a more active DNA single-strand break repair ( SSBR ) pathway , possibly due to a higher level of expression of the key SSBR protein , human AP endonuclease 1 ( Ape1 ) , and a significantly reduced propensity to undergo senescence as a result of increased telomerase activity and a low level of p21 protein expression .	enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
20525204_s9	No significant difference was seen in the rates of double-strand break repair ( DSBR ) between the two cell types , but DSBR in mammospheres appears to by-pass the need for H2AX phosphorylation .	genomic instability and mutation
20525204_s10	CONCLUSIONS Enhanced survival of MCF-7 tumor-initiating cells in response to ionizing radiation is primarily dependent on an inherent down-regulation of the senescence pathway .	enabling replicative immortality
20525204_s11	Since MCF-7 cells are representative of cancer cells that do not readily undergo apoptosis , consideration of senescence pathways may play a role in targeting stem cells from such tumors .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
20530580_s0	Autophagy is activated in response to cellular stressors and mediates lysosomal degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic material and organelles as a temporary cell survival mechanism .	
20530580_s1	Defective autophagy is implicated in human pathology , as disruption of protein and organelle homeostasis enables disease-promoting mechanisms such as toxic protein aggregation , oxidative stress , genomic damage , and inflammation .	
20530580_s2	We previously showed that autophagy-defective immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells are susceptible to metabolic stress , DNA damage , and genomic instability .	
20530580_s3	We now report that autophagy deficiency is associated with endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and oxidative stress , and with deregulation of p62-mediated keratin homeostasis in mammary cells , allograft tumors , and mammary tissues from genetically engineered mice .	
20530580_s4	In human breast tumors , high phospho(Ser73)-K8 levels are inversely correlated with Beclin 1 expression .	
20530580_s5	Thus , autophagy preserves cellular fitness by limiting ER and oxidative stress , a function potentially important in autophagy-mediated suppression of mammary tumorigenesis .	resisting cell death
20530580_s6	Furthermore , autophagy regulates keratin homeostasis in the mammary gland via a p62-dependent mechanism .	resisting cell death
20530580_s7	High phospho(Ser73)-K8 expression may be a marker of autophagy functional status in breast tumors and , as such , could have therapeutic implications for breast cancer patients .	resisting cell death
20530905_s0	Hypoxia is one of the inevitable circumstances of various tumors .	
20530905_s1	It controls various levels of regulation in tumor progression and results in tumor resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy .	
20530905_s2	Here we investigated a synthetic TPZ derivative , N-ethoxymethyl-3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4-dioxide ( XQ2 ) , a novel compound that induced anti-cancer effects both in normoxia and in hypoxia , cell proliferation assay found that XQ2 exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on the tested cancer cell lines both in normoxia and in hypoxia .	
20530905_s3	Flow cytometry and western blot studies indicated that XQ2 induces G2/M arrest and a caspase-dependent apoptosis in A549 cells .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
20530905_s4	Additionally , intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) appear to play a key role in the anticancer effect of XQ2 in hypoxia .	
20530905_s5	Taken together , our data suggest that XQ2 exerted anticancer action by suppressing the ROS level and triggering cell-cycle arrest and the caspase-dependent pathway , which is associated with apoptosis .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20540983_s0	Magnetite iron nanoparticles have been widely used as contrast agents and in thermal therapy for cancer .	
20540983_s1	However , their adverse effects on human health have not been fully investigated .	
20540983_s2	In this study , iron oxide nanoparticles were prepared using inorganic iron chloride ( size : 5.3+/-3.6 nm in phosphate buffered saline , surface charge : 23.14 mV ) , and their inflammatory responses were investigated .	
20540983_s3	When mice were treated with iron oxide nanoparticles ( 250 microg/kg , 500 microg/kg , and 1mg/kg ) by a single intratracheal instillation , the level of intracellular reduced glutathione ( GSH ) was decreased in the cells of bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid .	
20540983_s4	The arrest of cell cycles in G1 phase was observed , but S-phase was significantly decreased .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20540983_s5	The concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1 , TNF-alpha , and IL-6 ) were dose-dependently increased at day 1 after instillation in the BAL fluid and in the blood .	tumor promoting inflammation
20540983_s6	During the experimental period of 28 days , pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1 , TNF-alpha , and IL-6 ) , Th0 cytokine ( IL-2 ) , Th1 type cytokine ( IL-12 ) , Th2 type cytokines ( IL-4 and IL-5 ) , TGF-beta , and IgE were also elevated .	tumor promoting inflammation
20540983_s7	Expressions of many genes related with inflammation or tissue damage such as heat shock protein , matrix metalloproteinase , tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases , and serum amyloid A were significantly induced .	tumor promoting inflammation
20540983_s8	Formation of microgranuloma , which is one of the indicators for chronic inflammatory response , was observed in the alveolar space .	tumor promoting inflammation
20540983_s9	In addition , distribution of B cell and CD8+ T cell in blood lymphocytes was increased at day 28 .	tumor promoting inflammation
20540983_s10	Based on the result , iron oxide nanoparticles may subchronic induce inflammatory responses via oxidative stress in mice by a single intratracheal instillation .	tumor promoting inflammation
20541562_s0	Infection by Opisthorchis viverrini , a risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) may act through chronic inflammation , oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation ( LPO)-related damage and growth stimuli. 1,N6-etheno-2'-deoxyadenosine ( epsilondA ) , and 3,N4-etheno-2'-deoxycytidine ( epsilondC ) , markers for LPO-derived DNA damage were highly increased in white blood cell and urine of O. viverrini-infected Thai patients .	
20541562_s1	In order to investigate tissue specificity etheno adducts were measured in a cholangiocarcinogenesis model , in O. viverrini-infected hamsters that had received N-nitrosodimethylamine ( NDMA , 12.5 ppm in dw ) for 2 months. epsilondA- and epsilondC-levels were analyzed in paraffin-embedded liver sections by a novel immunohistochemical method , from 21 up to 180 days post-O. viverrini-infection .	
20541562_s2	In inflamed areas of the liver , etheno adducts were localized in the nuclei of inflammatory cells and in the epithelial lining of the bile duct .	tumor promoting inflammation
20541562_s3	Semi-quantitative image analysis showed higher adduct levels in the liver of O. viverrini-infected hamsters , treated with or w/o NDMA when compared with untreated controls .	genomic instability and mutation
20541562_s4	Levels were found highest in the liver of O. viverrini-infected plus NDMA-treated hamsters .	
20541562_s5	Adducts increased in an age-dependent manner from O. viverrini-infection until CCA development .	genomic instability and mutation
20541562_s6	Increased adduct formation paralleled histopathological changes in plasma alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity , bile duct hyperplasia , dysplasia , precancerous lesions , and CCA appearance .	genomic instability and mutation
20541562_s7	Also elevated expression of alkyladenine DNA glycosylase ( AAG ) , which excises 1,N6-ethenoadenine ( epsilonA ) was linked to higher adduct formation , suggesting imbalanced repair .	genomic instability and mutation
20541562_s8	Our results implicate accumulation of inflammation-related , promutagenic DNA damage in target tissue and possibly imbalanced repair in the onset of cholangiocarcinogenesis .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
20550888_s0	Contact inhibition is the process by which cells switch from a motile growing state to a passive and stabilized state upon touching their neighbors .	
20550888_s1	When two cells touch , an adhesion link is created between them by means of transmembrane E-cadherin proteins .	
20550888_s2	Simultaneously , their actin filaments stop polymerizing in the direction perpendicular to the membrane and reorganize to create an apical belt that colocalizes with the adhesion links .	
20550888_s3	Here , we propose a detailed quantitative model of the role of cytoplasmic beta-catenin and alpha-catenin proteins in this process , treated as a reaction-diffusion system .	
20550888_s4	Upon cell-cell contact the concentration in alpha-catenin dimers increases , inhibiting actin branching and thereby reducing cellular motility and expansion pressure .	
20550888_s5	This model provides a mechanism for contact inhibition that could explain previously unrelated experimental findings on the role played by E-cadherin , beta-catenin , and alpha-catenin in the cellular phenotype and in tumorigenesis .	evading growth suppressors
20550888_s6	In particular , we address the effect of a knockout of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene .	
20550888_s7	Potential direct tests of our model are discussed .	
20564218_s0	Proliferation of non-transformed cells is regulated by cell-cell contacts , which are referred to as contact-inhibition .	
20564218_s1	Vice versa , transformed cells are characterised by a loss of contact-inhibition .	
20564218_s2	Despite its generally accepted importance for cell-cycle control , little is known about the intracellular signalling pathways involved in contact-inhibition .	
20564218_s3	Unravelling the molecular mechanisms of contact-inhibition and its loss during tumourigenesis will be an important step towards the identification of novel target genes in tumour diagnosis and treatment .	
20564218_s4	To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms we identified the transcriptional programme of contact-inhibition in NIH3T3 fibroblast using high-density microarrays .	
20564218_s5	Setting the cut off : &gt;or=1.5-fold , P &lt;or= 0.05 , 853 genes and 73 cDNA sequences were differentially expressed in confluent compared to exponentially growing cultures .	
20564218_s6	Importing these data into GenMAPP software revealed a comprehensive list of cell-cycle regulatory genes mediating G0/G1 arrest , which was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot .	
20564218_s7	In a narrow analysis ( cut off : &gt;or=2-fold , P &lt;or= 0.002 ) , we found 110 transcripts to be differentially expressed representing 107 genes and 3 cDNA sequences involved , for example , in proliferation , signal transduction , transcriptional regulation , cell adhesion and communication .	
20564218_s8	Interestingly , the majority of genes was upregulated indicating that contact-inhibition is not a passive state , but actively induced .	evading growth suppressors
20564218_s9	Furthermore , we confirmed differential expression of eight genes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and identified the potential tumour suppressor transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta)-1-induced clone 22 ( TSC-22 ; tgfb1i4 ) as a novel protein to be induced in contact-inhibited cells .	evading growth suppressors
20569502_s0	INTRODUCTION Tamoxifen is the most widely prescribed anti-estrogen treatment for patients with estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive breast cancer .	
20569502_s1	However , there is still a need for biomarkers that reliably predict endocrine sensitivity in breast cancers and these may well be expressed in a dynamic manner .	
20569502_s2	METHODS In this study we assessed gene expression changes at multiple time points ( days 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 14 ) after tamoxifen treatment in the ER-positive ZR-75-1 xenograft model that displays significant changes in apoptosis , proliferation and angiogenesis within 2 days of therapy .	
20569502_s3	RESULTS Hierarchical clustering identified six time-related gene expression patterns , which separated into three groups : two with early/transient responses , two with continuous/late responses and two with variable response patterns .	
20569502_s4	The early/transient response represented reductions in many genes that are involved in cell cycle and proliferation ( e.g .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20569502_s5	BUB1B , CCNA2 , CDKN3 , MKI67 , UBE2C ) , whereas the continuous/late changed genes represented the more classical estrogen response genes ( e.g .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20569502_s6	TFF1 , TFF3 , IGFBP5 ) .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20569502_s7	Genes and the proteins they encode were confirmed to have similar temporal patterns of expression in vitro and in vivo and correlated with reduction in tumour volume in primary breast cancer .	
20569502_s8	The profiles of genes that were most differentially expressed on days 2 , 4 and 7 following treatment were able to predict prognosis , whereas those most changed on days 1 and 14 were not , in four tamoxifen treated datasets representing a total of 404 patients .	
20569502_s9	CONCLUSIONS Both early/transient/proliferation response genes and continuous/late/estrogen-response genes are able to predict prognosis of primary breast tumours in a dynamic manner .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20569502_s10	Temporal expression of therapy-response genes is clearly an important factor in characterising the response to endocrine therapy in breast tumours which has significant implications for the timing of biopsies in neoadjuvant biomarker studies .	
20571235_s0	OBJECTIVES Oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory mediators have been implicated in breast carcinogenesis .	
20571235_s1	We attempted to evaluate the markers of oxidative stress , antioxidant mechanism and the inflammatory pathway in patients with breast cancer .	
20571235_s2	METHODS This study was carried out in departments of Biochemistry and Surgery , Maulana Azad Medical College and associated Hospitals , New Delhi , India .	
20571235_s3	A total of 60 cases of carcinoma of the breast and 60 healthy controls were included in the study .	
20571235_s4	The parameters that were assayed include markers of oxidative stress-conjugated dienes , thiobarbitone reactive substances ( TBARS ) , antioxidants-superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) , glutathione ( GSH ) and markers of inflammation-interleukin-6(IL-6) and ferritin .	
20571235_s5	RESULTS There was a significant decline in the antioxidant levels and a significant rise in oxidant levels in patients with carcinoma of the breast , compared to controls .	tumor promoting inflammation
20571235_s6	The inflammatory markers-IL-6 and ferritin-were also significantly higher in patients with breast cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
20571235_s7	A significantly positive correlation was observed between the IL-6 levels and conjugated dienes with the stage of breast carcinoma ; whilst a significantly negative correlation was observed between the levels of conjugated dienes and superoxide dismutase and superoxide dismutase levels with the disease staging .	tumor promoting inflammation
20571235_s8	CONCLUSIONS This study underlines the interplay between inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of breast cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
20571235_s9	MINI ABSTRACT : An intense research is underway to identify the possible risk factors and the molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of breast cancer .	
20571235_s10	Inflammation and oxidative stress are two such etiologies investigated in our study .	tumor promoting inflammation
20572576_s0	AIMS AND BACKGROUND To investigate a six-drug combination in patients with nonmetastatic Ewing sarcoma , focusing on chemotherapy-induced necrosis and chemotherapy toxicity in adult and pediatric patients .	
20572576_s1	METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN Alternating cycles of vincristine ( 1.5 mg/m2 ) , doxorubicin ( 80 mg/m2 ) and cyclophosfamide ( 1200 mg/m2 ) ( weeks 0 , 6 , 13 , 22 and 31 ) , ifosfamide ( 9 g/m2 ) , vincristine ( 1.5 mg/m2 ) , and actinomycin D ( 1.5 mg/m2 ) ( weeks 3 , 16 , 25 and 34 ) , and ifosfamide ( 9 g/m2 ) and etoposide ( 450 mg/m2 ) ( weeks 9 , 19 , 28 and 37 ) were administered .	
20572576_s2	Primary chemotherapy-induced necrosis was graded : G3 ( complete necrosis ) , G2 ( microfoci of tumor cells ) and G1 ( macrofoci of tumor cells ) .	
20572576_s3	RESULTS From 1996 to 1999 , 50 patients with Ewing sarcoma were enrolled .	
20572576_s4	The median age was 23.5 years ( range , 4-56 ) .	
20572576_s5	Chemotherapy-induced necrosis ( in 28 patients ) was G3 in 36% , G2 in 21% and G1 in 43% .	
20572576_s6	At a median follow-up of 110 months ( range , 36-129 ) , 5-year overall survival and event-free survival were 72% and 66% , respectively .	
20572576_s7	According to histologic response , 5-year event-free survival was 90% in G3 , 83% in G2 , and 42% in G1 ( P = 0.02 ) .	
20572576_s8	In adult and pediatric ( &lt;18 years ) patients , the incidence of G4 leukopenia was 62% and 74% , respectively , with febrile neutropenia in 13% and 21% , respectively .	
20572576_s9	G4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 3% of cycles in adults and in 7% in pediatric patients .	
20572576_s10	Platelet and red blood cell transfusions were required respectively in 1% and 11% of cycles in adults and in 6% and 24% of cycles in pediatric patients .	
20572576_s11	CONCLUSIONS The six-drug combination can be administered safely in adult and pediatric populations .	
20572576_s12	About 40% of patients have a poor chemotherapy-induced tumor necrosis , leading to poor probability of survival .	resisting cell death
20572576_s13	New strategies are recommended to improve survival of poor responders to the six-drug combination .	
20574919_s0	Recent studies have demonstrated that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) are able to suppress cell proliferation and inhibit tumor growth .	
20574919_s1	The objective of our study was to investigate the influence of a high dose EPA on the development of the tumor phenotype in ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( Atm)-deficient mice , a genetic cancer model that is associated with increased levels of oxidative stress .	
20574919_s2	We analyzed toxicity , proliferation , cell-cycle progression , and apoptosis of EPA in vitro and latency to tumorigenesis in vivo .	
20574919_s3	Because of the impact of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) on the tumor incidence in ataxia telangiectasia ( AT ) , we further analyzed the effect of EPA on the generation of ROS and oxidative DNA damage ( ODD ) .	
20574919_s4	EPA effectively inhibited proliferation , altered cell-cycle progression , and induced apoptosis of tumor cells ( AT-4 ) .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20574919_s5	EPA showed no effect on the latency to tumorigenesis in Atm-deficient mice .	
20574919_s6	EPA treatment was accompanied by a significant increase of ROS and ODD .	
20574919_s7	Our results demonstrate the antiproliferative effect of EPA on tumor cells by alteration of cell-cycle progression and induction of apoptosis in vitro .	
20574919_s8	On the other hand , EPA treatment of Atm-deficient mice led to the formation of ROS and accumulation of ODD that might have abrogated the anticarcinogenic effect caused by EPA .	
20574924_s0	Medicinal mushroom Ganoderma lucidum is one of the most esteemed natural products that have been used in the traditional Chinese medicine .	
20574924_s1	In this article , we demonstrate that G. lucidum triterpene extract ( GLT ) suppresses proliferation of human colon cancer cells HT-29 and inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model of colon cancer .	
20574924_s2	These effects of GLT are associated with the cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and the induction of the programmed cell death Type II-autophagy in colon cancer cells .	
20574924_s3	Here , we show that GLT induces formation of autophagic vacuoles and upregulates expression of Beclin-1 ( 1.3-fold increase ) and LC-3 ( 7.3-fold increase ) proteins in colon cancer cells and in tumors in a xenograft model ( Beclin-1 , 3.9-fold increase ; LC-3 , 1.9-fold increase ) .	resisting cell death
20574924_s4	Autophagy is mediated through the inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38 MAPK ) because p38 MAPK inhibitor , SB202190 , induces autophagy and expression of Beclin-1 ( 1.2-fold increase ) and LC-3 ( 7.4-fold increase ) , and GLT suppresses phosphorylation of p38 MAPK ( approximately 60% inhibition ) in colon cancer cells .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20574924_s5	Taken together , our data demonstrate a novel mechanism responsible for the inhibition of colon cancer cells by G. lucidum and suggest GLT as natural product for the treatment of colon cancer .	
20574928_s0	We have previously demonstrated the antiproliferative effect of two flavonoids-2,2'-dihydroxychalcone ( DHC ) , a novel synthetic flavonoid , and fisetin , a naturally occurring flavonol-in prostate cancer cells .	
20574928_s1	In this study , we further examine the mechanisms of these compounds on survival and proliferation pathways .	
20574928_s2	DHC and fisetin ( 1-50 microM ) caused a dose-dependent reduction in viability , a concomitant increase in apoptosis in PC3 cells at 72 h , and a decrease in clonogenic survival at 24 h treatment .	
20574928_s3	DHC was considerably more potent than fisetin in these cytotoxicity assays .	
20574928_s4	The mechanism of accelerated cellular senescence was not activated by either compound in PC3 or lymph node carcinoma of the prostate ( LNCaP ) cells .	enabling replicative immortality
20574928_s5	Gene expression alterations in PC3 and LNCaP cells treated with 15 muM DHC and 25 microM fisetin for 6 to 24 h were determined by oligonucleotide array .	
20574928_s6	Amongst the most highly represented functional categories of genes altered by both compounds was the cell cycle category .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20574928_s7	In total , 100 cell cycle genes were altered by DHC and fisetin including 27 genes with key functions in G2/M phase that were downregulated by both compounds .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20574928_s8	Other functional categories altered included chromosome organization , apoptosis , and stress response .	
20574928_s9	These results demonstrate the multiple mechanisms of antitumor activity of DHC and fisetin in prostate cancer cells in vitro .	
20580968_s0	In traditional biochemical experiments , the behavior of individual proteins is obscured by ensemble averaging .	
20580968_s1	To better understand the behavior of proteins that bind to and/or translocate on DNA , we have developed instrumentation that uses optical trapping , microfluidic solution delivery , and fluorescent microscopy to visualize either individual proteins or assemblies of proteins acting on single molecules of DNA .	
20580968_s2	The general experimental design involves attaching a single DNA molecule to a polystyrene microsphere that is then used as a microscopic handle to manipulate individual DNA molecules with a laser trap .	
20580968_s3	Visualization is achieved by fluorescently labeling either the DNA or the protein of interest , followed by direct imaging using high-sensitivity fluorescence microscopy .	
20580968_s4	We describe the sample preparation and instrumentation used to visualize the interaction of individual proteins with single molecules of DNA .	
20580968_s5	As examples , we describe the application of these methods to the study of proteins involved in recombination-mediated DNA repair , a process essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity .	genomic instability and mutation
20583210_s0	UNLABELLED Activation of beta-catenin , the central effector of the canonical Wnt pathway and a recognized oncogene , has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma .	
20583210_s1	We examined N-nitrosodiethylamine ( DEN)-induced tumorigenesis in hepatic beta-catenin conditional knockout mice ( beta-cat KO ) .	
20583210_s2	Male beta-cat KO and age- and sex-matched littermate controls were given a single intraperitoneal DEN injection and followed for 6-12 months for hepatic tumors .	
20583210_s3	Hepatic tumors were characterized for histology , proliferation , apoptosis , oxidative stress , and specific proteins by way of western blot , immunohistochemistry , and coprecipitation studies .	
20583210_s4	For in vivo tumor intervention studies , specific inhibitors were administered intraperitoneally or through drinking water .	
20583210_s5	Intriguingly , beta-cat KO mice showed a paradoxical increase in susceptibility to DEN-induced tumorigenesis .	
20583210_s6	This accelerated tumorigenesis is due to increased injury and inflammation , unrestricted oxidative stress , fibrosis , and compensatory increase in hepatocyte proliferation secondary to platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRalpha)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PIK3CA)/Akt activation and c-Myc overexpression .	tumor promoting inflammation
20583210_s7	In vitro suppression of beta-catenin expression in hepatoma cells led to enhanced PDGFRalpha expression , which was abrogated in the presence of nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-kappaB ) inhibitor .	
20583210_s8	Daily treatment of 6-month-old DEN-exposed beta-cat KO with PDGFRalpha inhibitor dramatically reduced tumor numbers and size .	
20583210_s9	Inclusion of N-acetyl-L-cysteine , a known antioxidant and NF-kappaB inhibitor , in the drinking water led to complete abolition of tumorigenesis in DEN-exposed beta-cat KO .	
20583210_s10	CONCLUSION Loss of beta-catenin impairs the liver's ability to counteract DEN-induced oxidative stress and enhances tumorigenesis through PDGFRalpha/PIK3CA/Akt signaling .	tumor promoting inflammation
20583210_s11	Blockade of PDGFRalpha or oxidative stress dramatically affects beta-catenin-deficient tumorigenesis .	tumor promoting inflammation
20583210_s12	Also , hepatoma cells use PDGFRalpha/PIK3CA signaling as an escape mechanism following beta-catenin suppression , and their sequential suppression profoundly impedes tumor proliferation .

20587979_s10	The final diagnosis was metastatic brain tumor from thymic carcinoma .	
20587979_s11	Rapid progression of neurological impairment inconsistent with a benign extraaxial tumor needs prompt surgical intervention .	
20588232_s0	OBJECTIVE To analyze the profiles of interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-beta1 ) and interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) in serum and the tumor microenvironment ( cyst fluid , ascites ) in women with ovarian cancer or benign ovarian tumors to find the differences in their immunological status .	
20588232_s1	We also estimated serum cytokines as biomarkers to distinguish preoperatively between malignant or benign character of tumors .

20593709_s1	Both clinics have sound experience of RCC surgery , and modern laparoscopic equipment .	
20593709_s2	A retrospective chart review of all patients with RCC diagnosed and treated in the last year was conducted at the two sites .	
20593709_s3	MATERIALS AND METHODS In total , 88 patients ( 66 males and 22 females , mean age 58 years , range 24-81 years ) were enrolled in the study .	
20593709_s4	Comparisons were made between some clinical and pathologic parameters with an established prognostic and therapeutic impact .	
20593709_s5	The type of surgery perormed at both sites was analyzed as well .	
20593709_s6	All these comparative studies were performed in relation to the 2008 EAU guidelines on the current management of RCC .	
20593709_s7	Commercially available statistical software was used for the purpose .	
20593709_s8	RESULTS The results showed no difference between the two sites regarding the RCC incidence and the patients ' age and gender .	
20593709_s9	Significant differences ( p value &lt ; 0.0001 ) emerged in terms of : the median size of the tumors at surgery ( 8.5 cm in Varna , SD + 4.04 vs. 4.4 cm in Bari , SD _ 2.02 ) ; T-stage of the tumor ( Varna T T2-30% , T3-22% , T4-15% vs. Bari T1-64% , T2-12% , T3-24% , T4-0% ) ; N-positive disese ( 24% vs. 2% ) ; distant metastases ( 20% vs. 2% ) and presence of necrosis in the renal masses ( 37% vs. 19% ) .	resisting cell death
20593709_s10	Thus , 85% of Varna patients underwent open radical nephrectomy , 11% nephron-sparing surgery and 4% explorative laparotomy , due to inoperability of the renal mass .	resisting cell death
20593709_s11	Only 29% of Bari patients were treated by open radical nephrectomy , 12% underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy , 57% open partial nephrectomy and 2% laparoscopic partial tumor resection .	
20593709_s12	Conclusions : These numbers demonstrate more advantageous tumour features at the Italian clinic in terms of organ-sparing surgical options ( open and laparoscopic ) , whereas in the Bulgarian clinic the tumour features pose certain limitations to the application of modern surgical techniques .	
20593709_s13	This difference is due to early diagnosis of RCC in Italy , allowing treatment of smaller volume tumors .	
20593913_s0	The soluble hexavalent chromium Cr ( VI ) used in industrial welding is an environmental contaminant widely recognized to act as a carcinogen , mutagen and teratogen towards humans and animals .	
20593913_s1	The carcinogenic potential of metals is a major issue in defining human health risk from exposure .	
20593913_s2	In the present investigation , 93 welders and 60 control subjects with similar mean ages , smoking prevalences and alcohol consumption were enrolled for DNA damage analysis in blood leucocytes by Micronucleus assay ( MN ) and the Comet assay .	
20593913_s3	DNA repair inhibition was also analyzed by assessing XPD gene polymorphism .	
20593913_s4	Welders showed a significant increase in micronucleated cells compared to controls with respect to their smoking habits and alcohol consumption , age and years of exposure ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	
20593913_s5	Results indicated that the welders had a larger mean comet tail length than that of the controls ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	
20593913_s6	The current study suggested that chronic occupational exposure to Cr ( VI ) during welding could lead to increased levels of DNA damage and repair inhibition .	genomic instability and mutation
20593952_s0	OBJECTIVE The study was undertaken to document and highlight the shortcomings of histopathology reporting of breast carcinoma in Pakistan so that improvements can be recommended and a standardized protocol devised .	
20593952_s1	METHODS This was a descriptive cross sectional study and was conducted at Histopathology Department , Armed Forces Institute of Pathology , Rawalpindi from 1st January 2008 to 31st October 2008 .	
20593952_s2	Fifty consecutive breast carcinoma reports received for review from different laboratories were analyzed for documentation of patients age , sex , type of procedure/specimen , specimen size , tumour size , invasive tumour type , invasive tumour grade , comment on excision margins , extent of lymph node involvement , insitu component , lymphovascular invasion , necrosis , skin involvement and tabular format .	
20593952_s3	Frequencies and percentages were calculated for presence of these above mentioned variables in different reports , keeping in mind the possible information that could be obtained from a particular sample .	
20593952_s4	RESULTS It was found that the variable least mentioned in the reports was in situ component commented upon in only 23.2% of reports .	
20593952_s5	Necrosis was mentioned in 35% of reports .	resisting cell death
20593952_s6	Tabular format was found in 36% of reports only .	
20593952_s7	CONCLUSION Marked deficiencies are seen in histopathology reports for breast carcinoma due to the lack of any standardized reporting system .	
20593952_s8	Separate checklist formats for trucut biopsies , lumpectomies and mastectomies should be introduced to ensure uniform reporting .	
20604962_s0	BACKGROUND Barrett's esophagus ( BE ) is caused by gastroesophageal reflux with consecutive mucosal inflammation , predisposing patients to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) .	
20604962_s1	We investigated changes in T cell-related mucosal combinatorial molecular protein patterns in both diseases using the novel Multi-Epitope-Ligand-Cartography , a unique robotic whole-cell imaging technology that simultaneously visualizes dozens of proteins in structurally intact tissues and correlates cellular localization of proteins with function .	
20604962_s2	RESULTS Biopsies were taken during endoscopy from BE , EAC , and normal control tissue , and proteomic microscopy was performed on 32 different epitopes .	
20604962_s3	When the significance level was set to p &lt ; 0.0005 and the search depth to five antibody combinations , controls and BE can be differentiated by 63 , controls and EAC by 3222 , and BE from EAC by 1521 distinct protein combinations.For example , the number of activated apoptotic naÃ¯ve and memory T cells was significantly increased only in BE , whereas the number of activated apoptotic helper and regulatory T cells was significantly elevated in BE and EAC .	avoiding immune destruction,resisting cell death
20604962_s4	In contrast , the number of activated apoptotic cytotoxic T cells was significantly elevated only in EAC .	
20604962_s5	Confirming different pathways in BE and EAC , the number of T lymphocytes with p53 expression and downregulation of bcl2 expression ( CD3+p53+Bcl2-NfkB- ) was significantly increased in EAC compared to BE and controls .	
20604962_s6	Interestingly , the number of precursor T cells ( CD7+ ) was significantly elevated only in EAC .	avoiding immune destruction
20604962_s7	These cells lack Bax and caspase-8 , suggesting impaired apoptosis in the early stages of T cell differentiation .	resisting cell death
20604962_s8	CONCLUSION Proteomic analysis showed for the first time that proteins , which are critically involved in the mucosal immune system of the esophagus , are distinctly expressed in BE and EAC , whereas others are comparably altered in both diseases , suggesting that many pathogenic events might be shared by both diseases .	avoiding immune destruction
20604962_s9	Topological proteomic analysis , therefore , helps us to understand the different pathogenic events in the underlying disease pathways .	
20635689_s0	OBJECTIVE To study the effect of necrostatin ( Nec-1 ) on apoptosis induced by aluminum ( Al ) , and approach the mechanism .	
20635689_s1	METHODS Neural cell death model was made by 4 mmol/L Al treated neuroblastoma cells ( SH-SY5Y ) .	
20635689_s2	Cell viabilities were detected at different concentrations of Al and/or Nec-1 .	
20635689_s3	Hoechst 33342/PI double staining was used to observe apoptosis and ( or ) necrosis that were quantified by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI double staining .	
20635689_s4	Apoptotic pathway was tested by activities of Caspase-3 , Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 .	
20635689_s5	In addition , the expression of NF-kappa B and Cyt-c was measured by immunocytochemistry .	
20635689_s6	RESULTS Cell viabilities were significantly decreased with the increasing concentrations of Al ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) , which could be significantly upregulated by 60 micromol/L Nec-1 ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) and were correlated with the concentrations of Nec-1 ( P &lt ; 0.05 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	
20635689_s7	Apoptosis and necrosis were observed under fluorescent microscope and quantified by flow cytometry , which suggested an increasing trend of apoptotic and necrotic rates ( P &lt ; 0.05 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	resisting cell death
20635689_s8	Whereas , Nec-1 could not only decrease the necrotic rate but also apoptotic rate as well ( P &lt ; 0.05 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	resisting cell death
20635689_s9	Data of Nec-1 on caspases activities showed that Nec-1 could not affect Caspase-9 activity ( P &gt ; 0.05 ) and Cty-c protein expression as well ( P &gt ; 0.05 ) .	
20635689_s10	However , Nec-1 could reduce Caspase-8 activity significantly ( P &lt ; 0.05 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) and increase NF-kappa B protein expression ( P &lt ; 0.05 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) and finally decrease Caspase-3 activity ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
20635689_s11	CONCLUSION Nec-1 could reduce cell apoptosis induced by Al , through Caspase-8 pathway , and up-regulate the expression of NF-kappa B protein .	
20639624_s0	Bisphosphonates ( BPs ) are the current standard of care for bone lesions in patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ) but they are associated with a number of side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw .	
20639624_s1	The exact mechanisms of osteonecrosis are not elucidated , and its physiopathology is based on several hypotheses such as a decrease in bone remodeling or an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis .	
20639624_s2	The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis .	
20639624_s3	We examined the apoptosis of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in MM subjects before and after BP treatment and in osteonecrosis patients using a flow-cytometric analysis .	
20639624_s4	Our data showed an increase in endothelial cell apoptosis in MM patients after BP administration and in osteonecrosis subjects .	
20639624_s5	Our study seems in agreement with the hypothesis that BPs can inhibit angiogenesis interfering with endothelial cell proliferation and survival , leading to loss of blood vessels and avascular necrosis .	inducing angiogenesis,resisting cell death
20661828_s0	The biological activities of tocotrienols are receiving increasing attention .	
20661828_s1	Herein , we report the efficacy of a mixed-tocotrienol diet against prostate tumorigenesis in the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate ( TRAMP ) mouse model .	
20661828_s2	Male TRAMP mice , 8 wk old , were fed 0.1% , 0.3% , or 1% mixed tocotrienols in AIN-76A diet up to 24 wk old .	
20661828_s3	Likewise , a positive control group consisting of male TRAMP mice and a negative control group consisting of wild-type nontransgenic mice were fed regular AIN-76A diet up to 24 wk old .	
20661828_s4	Our results show that mixed-tocotrienol-fed groups had a lower incidence of tumor formation along with a significant reduction in the average wet weight of genitourinary apparatus .	
20661828_s5	Furthermore , mixed tocotrienols significantly reduced the levels of high-grade neoplastic lesions as compared to the positive controls .	
20661828_s6	This decrease in levels of high-grade neoplastic lesions was found to be associated with increased expression of proapoptotic proteins BAD ( Bcl(2) antagonist of cell death ) and cleaved caspase-3 and cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
20661828_s7	In contrast , the expression of cyclins A and E were found to be decreased in mixed-tocotrienol groups .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20661828_s8	Taken together , our results show that by modulating cell cycle regulatory proteins and increasing expression of proapoptotic proteins , mixed tocotrienols suppress prostate tumorigenesis in the TRAMP mice .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20664182_s0	AIMS To screen the genes and possible signal transduction pathways with which nucleostemin ( NS ) interacts and explore the mechanism of NS in prostate cancer .	
20664182_s1	METHODS NS-specific short-hairpin RNA expression plasmid was used to downregulate the NS level in PC-3 cells and the changes of cell cycle were studied .	
20664182_s2	After that , oligonucleotide DNA microarray was used to screen the genome changes in PC-3 cells and quantitative real-time PCR was used to further confirm the differentially expressed genes .	
20664182_s3	RESULTS Detection of cell cycle showed a decrease of S stage and an increase of G1 stage after downregulation of NS. 219 differentially expressed genes were found and these genes were involved in cell cycle , cell proliferation , signal transduction , cell apoptosis and cell differentiation , and so on .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20664182_s4	Genes related to cell cycle were discussed emphatically .	
20664182_s5	INK4 family genes ( P15 , P16 , P18 ) were upregulated while cyclin D1 HDAC1 were downregulated .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20664182_s6	These genes were tightly related to CDK4/6-cyclin D and pRb-E2F1 complexes .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20664182_s7	CONCLUSION NS is an important G1/S checkpoint regulator and it could regulate cell cycles via a p53-independent pathway in prostate cancer .	evading growth suppressors
20681405_s0	A novel compound 2-arylidene-4,7-dimethyl indan-1-one synthesized was screened for anticancer effect against the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line , MCF-7 .	
20681405_s1	An IC50 value of &gt ; or = 80 microM , nontoxic to the normal breast cell line HBL-100 , showed complete inhibition of the MCF-7 cells .	
20681405_s2	Analysis of mechanisms showed nuclear fragmentation and DNA laddering in gel electrophoresis .	resisting cell death
20681405_s3	GSH and GR levels were found to be reduced after the compound treatment .	resisting cell death
20681405_s4	Cell cycle analysis using fluorescent cytometry revealed G2/M phase arrest , which indicates the compound deserves consideration for further studies against cancer .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20681796_s0	Radiation-induced carcinogenesis is a major concern both for astronauts on long-term space missions and for cancer patients being treated with therapeutic radiation .	
20681796_s1	Exposure to radiation induces oxidative stress and chronic inflammation , which are critical initiators and promoters of carcinogenesis .	
20681796_s2	Many studies have demonstrated that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antioxidants can reduce the risk of radiation-induced cancer .	
20681796_s3	In this study , we found that a synthetic triterpenoid , CDDO-Me ( bardoxolone methyl ) , was able to protect human colon epithelial cells ( HCECs ) against radiation-induced transformation .	
20681796_s4	HCECs that were immortalized by ectopic expression of hTERT and cdk4 and exhibit trisomy for chromosome 7 ( a non-random chromosome change that occurs in 37% of premalignant colon adenomas ) can be transformed experimentally with one combined exposure to 2 Gy of protons at 1 GeV/nucleon followed 24 h later by 50 cGy of ( 56)Fe ions at 1 GeV/nucleon .	
20681796_s5	Transformed cells showed an increase in proliferation rate and in both anchorage-dependent and independent colony formation ability .	
20681796_s6	A spectrum of chromosome aberrations was observed in transformed cells , with 40% showing loss of 17p ( e.g. loss of one copy of p53 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
20681796_s7	Pretreatment of cells with pharmacological doses of CDDO-Me , which has been shown to induce antioxidative as well as anti-inflammatory responses , prevented the heavy-ion-induced increase in proliferation rate and anchorage-dependent and independent colony formation efficiencies .	tumor promoting inflammation
20681796_s8	Taken together , these results demonstrate that experimentally immortalized human colon epithelial cells with a non-random chromosome 7 trisomy are valuable premalignant cellular reagents that can be used to study radiation-induced colorectal carcinogenesis .	
20681796_s9	The utility of premalignant HCECs to test novel compounds such as CDDO-Me that can be used to protect against radiation-induced neoplastic transformation is also demonstrated .	
20682066_s0	INTRODUCTION The homeobox-containing transcription factor muscle segment homeobox 2 ( Msx2 ) plays an important role in mammary gland development .	
20682066_s1	However , the clinical implications of Msx2 expression in breast cancer are unclear .	
20682066_s2	The aims of this study were to investigate the potential clinical value of Msx2 as a breast cancer biomarker and to clarify its functional role in vitro .	
20682066_s3	METHODS Msx2 gene expression was first examined in a well-validated breast cancer transcriptomic dataset of 295 patients .	
20682066_s4	Msx2 protein expression was then evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray ( TMA ) containing 281 invasive breast tumours .	
20682066_s5	Finally , to assess the functional role of Msx2 in vitro , Msx2 was ectopically expressed in a highly invasive breast tumour cell line ( MDA-MB-231 ) and an immortalised breast cell line ( MCF10a ) , and these cell lines were examined for changes in growth rate , cell death and cell signalling .	
20682066_s6	RESULTS Examination of Msx2 mRNA expression in a breast cancer transcriptomic dataset demonstrated that increased levels of Msx2 were associated with good prognosis ( P = 0.011 ) .	
20682066_s7	Evaluation of Msx2 protein expression on a TMA revealed that Msx2 was detectable in both tumour cell nuclei and cytoplasm .	
20682066_s8	Cytoplasmic Msx2 expression was associated with low grade tumours ( P = 0.012 ) and Ki67 negativity ( P = 0.018 ) .	
20682066_s9	Nuclear Msx2 correlated with low-grade tumours ( P = 0.015 ) , estrogen receptor positivity ( P = 0.038 ) , low Ki67 ( P = 0.005 ) and high cyclin D1 expression ( P = 0.037 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20682066_s10	Increased cytoplasmic Msx2 expression was associated with a prolonged breast cancer-specific survival ( P = 0.049 ) , recurrence-free survival ( P = 0.029 ) and overall survival ( P = 0.019 ) .	
20682066_s11	Ectopic expression of Msx2 in breast cell lines resulted in radically decreased cell viability mediated by induction of cell death via apoptosis .	resisting cell death
20682066_s12	Further analysis of Msx2-expressing cells revealed increased levels of p21 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) and decreased levels of Survivin and the ' split ends ' ( SPEN ) protein family member RBM15 .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20682066_s13	CONCLUSIONS We conclude that increased Msx2 expression results in improved outcome for breast cancer patients , possibly by increasing the likelihood of tumour cell death by apoptosis .	
20686220_s0	This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which the human lung cancer drug resistance-related gene BC006151 regulates chemosensitivity by down-regulating BC006151 expression via antisense gene transfer in H446/(C)DDP cells .	
20686220_s1	A retroviral vector containing the antisense BC006151 sequence was constructed and transfected into H446/(C)DDP cells .	
20686220_s2	Transfection of the empty vector served as a negative control .	
20686220_s3	The two groups of transfected cells were treated with various chemotherapeutic agents , after which morphological changes in cell ultrastructure were compared by transmission electron microscopy , cell proliferation and chemosensitivity to particular chemotherapeutic agents were compared by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method , the effects of chemotherapy on cell cycle and apoptosis were compared by flow cytometry , and Bcl-2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis .	
20686220_s4	Results showed that apoptotic body-like structures were identified by transmission electron microscopy in the antisense gene-transfected cells .	resisting cell death
20686220_s5	MTT founded that these cells exhibited a significantly lower level of proliferation than the control cells ( p&lt;0.01 ) , together with a markedly increased sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic agents ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	
20686220_s6	Flow cytometry analysis revealed that a G1 phase arrest accounted for the reduction in proliferation in the antisense gene-transfected cells ; increased apoptosis was also detected ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	evading growth suppressors
20686220_s7	Both immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis confirmed that Bcl-2 expression was significantly down-regulated in the antisense gene-transfected cells compared to controls .	resisting cell death
20686220_s8	In a word , down-regulation of BC006151 can significantly inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis of H446/(C)DDP cells after chemotherapy , and this gene may play an important role in the development of multidrug resistance in lung cancer .	resisting cell death
20686221_s0	The expression of " growth arrest and DNA damage inducible genes 45 and 153 " is related to apoptotic induction of cells .	
20686221_s1	GADD45 is an effector gene of the tumor suppressor p53 , and GADD153 is associated with cellular function of cancer prevention .	
20686221_s2	Curcumin , isolated from the plant Curcuma longa ( LINN ) , has been investigated as a promising cancer preventive in food because curcumin , a phenolic and coloring compound , is widely ingested in the Indian subcontinent .	
20686221_s3	However , the exact mechanisms of action of curcumin have not yet been clearly elucidated .	
20686221_s4	Based on our successful results with green tea catechins as cancer preventive , we studied the relationship between the expression of GADD45 and 153 and apoptotic induction in human lung cancer cell line PC-9 .	
20686221_s5	In our study curcumin increased the expression of GADD45 and 153 in a p53-independent manner .	
20686221_s6	Curcumin also inhibited the growth of PC-9 cells and induced G(1)/S arrest of the cell-cycle followed by strong induction of apoptosis .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20686221_s7	Treatment with GADD45 and 153 small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) inhibited the apoptotic induction in PC-9 cells by curcumin .	
20686221_s8	Moreover , curcumin induced the expression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor genes p21 and p27 , while it inhibited the expression of numerous genes , including Bcl-2 , cyclin D1 , CDK2 , CDK4 and CDK6 .	evading growth suppressors
20686221_s9	All the results with PC-9 cells suggest that the up-regulation of GADD45 and 153 by curcumin is a prime mechanism in the anticancer activity of curcumin .	
20694196_s0	BACKGROUND The most deadly form of cancer is not lung or colon , breast or prostate ; it is any cancer that has become metastatic .	
20694196_s1	Mortality due to metastatic melanoma , one of the most aggressive and deadly cancers , has increased steadily over the last several decades .	
20694196_s2	Unfortunately , the arsenal of chemotherapeutic agents available today is most often unsuccessful at extending and improving the life expectancy of afflicted individuals .	
20694196_s3	We sought to identify an effective and nontoxic agent against metastatic melanoma .	
20694196_s4	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We chose to study Cloudman S-91 mouse melanoma cells ( sub-clone M3 , CCL53.1 ) because these cells are highly aggressive and metastatic , representing one of the deadliest types of cancer .	
20694196_s5	Melanoma cells also had an experimental advantage because their morphology , which is easily monitored , relates to the physiology of metastatic cells and normal melanocytes .	
20694196_s6	We chose to test methyl sulfone as a chemotherapeutic agent for two reasons .	
20694196_s7	Because of its chemical structure , we speculated a potential anti-cancer activity by targeting microtubules .	
20694196_s8	Equally important , methyl sulfone has a well-established safety profile in humans .	
20694196_s9	Surprisingly , we found that malignant melanoma cells exposed to methyl sulfone demonstrated the loss of phenotypes characteristic of malignant cells , and the reemergence of phenotypes characteristic of healthy melanocytes .	
20694196_s10	Briefly , over time methyl sulfone induced contact inhibition , loss of ability to migrate through an extracellular matrix , loss of anchorage-independent growth , proper wound healing followed by contact inhibition , irreversible senescence followed by arborization with melanosomes in arbors as seen in normal melanocytes .	enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors
20694196_s11	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Methyl sulfone may have clinical potential as a non-toxic agent effective against metastatic melanoma .	
20694196_s12	Additionally , methyl sulfone has promise as a tool to explore molecular mechanisms of metastatic transformation as well as fundamental processes such as cell migration , contact inhibition , wound healing and cellular senescence .	activating invasion and metastasis,enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors
20696059_s0	INTRODUCTION HER2 and estrogen receptor ( ER ) are important in breast cancer and are therapeutic targets of trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) and tamoxifen , respectively .	
20696059_s1	Retinoids inhibit breast cancer growth , and modulate signaling by HER2 and ER .	
20696059_s2	We hypothesized that treatment with retinoids and simultaneous targeting of HER2 and/or ER may have enhanced anti-tumor effects .	
20696059_s3	METHODS The effects of retinoids combined with trastuzumab or tamoxifen were examined in two human breast cancer cell lines in culture , BT474 and SKBR3 .	
20696059_s4	Assays of proliferation , apoptosis , differentiation , cell cycle distribution , and receptor signaling were performed .	
20696059_s5	RESULTS In HER2-overexpressing/ER-positive BT474 cells , combining all-trans retinoic acid ( atRA ) with tamoxifen or trastuzumab synergistically inhibited cell growth , and altered cell differentiation and cell cycle .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20696059_s6	Only atRA/trastuzumab-containing combinations induced apoptosis .	
20696059_s7	BT474 and HER2-overexpressing/ER-negative SKBR3 cells were treated with a panel of retinoids ( atRA , 9-cis-retinoic acid , 13-cis-retinoic acid , or N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide ( fenretinide ) ( 4-HPR) ) combined with trastuzumab .	
20696059_s8	In BT474 cells , none of the single agents except 4-HPR induced apoptosis , but again combinations of each retinoid with trastuzumab did induce apoptosis .	
20696059_s9	In contrast , the single retinoid agents did cause apoptosis in SKBR3 cells ; this was only modestly enhanced by addition of trastuzumab .	
20696059_s10	The retinoid drug combinations altered signaling by HER2 and ER .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20696059_s11	Retinoids were inactive in trastuzumab-resistant BT474 cells .	
20696059_s12	CONCLUSIONS Combining retinoids with trastuzumab maximally inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in trastuzumab-sensitive cells .	resisting cell death
20696059_s13	Treatment with such combinations may have benefit for breast cancer patients .	
20707650_s0	PURPOSE The cytotoxic effect of the combination treatment of TNF-alpha and hyperthermia on L929 and TNF-alpha-resistant L929 ( rL929 ) cells was investigated .	
20707650_s1	MATERIALS AND METHODS L929 cells were treated with TNF-alpha ( 5 ng/mL ) , heating at 43 degrees C or the combination of TNF-alpha and heating .	
20707650_s2	The cells were harvested at different time within the 24-hour period .	
20707650_s3	The viability and the type of cell death of the harvested cells were examined .	
20707650_s4	RESULTS When L929 cells were treated with a combination of TNF-alpha and heating the cells died quickly and apoptosis increased to an overwhelming extent , especially in the group pre-treated with TNF-alpha for 1 h prior to heating .	resisting cell death
20707650_s5	Although rL929 cells were resistant to TNF-alpha alone , the cells became sensitive to TNF-alpha treatment when combined with heating .	
20707650_s6	Similar to the L929 cell , the cells also died rapidly and exhibited apoptosis to a higher extent .	
20707650_s7	Using an Annexin-V-FITC kit and flow cytometer , we found that both necrosis and apoptosis occurred .	resisting cell death
20707650_s8	Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA extracted from treated cells showed that the DNA fragments were multiples of approximately 200 bp .	
20707650_s9	Furthermore , by studying the kinetics of cell death and apoptosis , we found that the loss of cell membrane integrity preceded the DNA fragmentation in both L929 and rL929 cells .	
20707650_s10	CONCLUSION The results suggested that hyperthermia may enhance the necrotic and apoptotic effects of TNF-alpha on some tumour cells and overcome the resistance of some tumour cells to TNF-alpha .	resisting cell death
20713694_s0	Chromosomal instability and the subsequent genetic mutations are considered to be critical factors in the development of the majority of solid tumors , but the mechanisms by which a stable diploid cell loses the ability to maintain genomic integrity are not well characterized .	
20713694_s1	We have approached this critical issue through the use of high-throughput screens in untransformed diploid epithelial cells .	
20713694_s2	In a screen of a cDNA library , we identified 13 kinases whose overexpression leads to increased ploidy .	
20713694_s3	In a series of shRNA screens , we identified 16 kinases whose loss leads to increased ploidy .	
20713694_s4	In both cDNA and shRNA screens , the majority of hits have not been linked previously to genomic stability .	
20713694_s5	We further show that sustained loss of the shRNA screening hits leads to multipolar spindles and heterogeneous chromosome content , two characteristics of chromosomal instability .	genomic instability and mutation
20713694_s6	Loss of several of the kinases leads to loss of contact inhibition and to anchorage-independent growth , vital traits acquired during tumor development .	evading growth suppressors
20713694_s7	We anticipate that this work will serve as a template for the comprehensive identification of pathways whose dysregulation can drive tumorigenesis through impaired karyotypic maintenance .	
20714087_s0	Taxol ( Paclitaxel ) is an important natural product for the treatment of solid tumors such as ovarian , breast , non-small-cell lung tumors , and some head and neck carcinomas .	
20714087_s1	Different concentrations of taxol trigger distinct effects on cell death forms .	
20714087_s2	In present study , cell counting kit ( CCK-8 ) assay , confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging , flow cytometry ( FCM ) and western blotting ( WB ) analysis were used to analyze the characteristics of cell death induced by low ( 35 nM ) and high ( 70 microM ) concentration of taxol respectively in human lung adenocarcinoma ( ASTC-a-1 ) cells .	
20714087_s3	Our results showed that low concentration of taxol induced cell death dominantly in apoptotic fashion associated with nuclear fragmentation , protein synthesis , phosphatidylserine ( PS ) externalization , G2/M cell cycle arrest , Bax translocation into mitochondria and caspase-3 activation , whereas high concentration of this drug induced significant cytoplasm vacuolization , mitochondria swelling and paraptosis-like cell death form without protein synthesis that is necessary for paraptosis .	resisting cell death
20714087_s4	Although the mechanism of high concentration of taxol-induced paraptosis-like cell death has not been clear , this finding might have a potential implication for cancer therapy , especially for apoptosis-resistant cancer .	
20717669_s0	The main objective of the present investigation was to study the urinary neopterin excretion in the context of the activation of the adaptive cellular immune system at the tumor site .	
20717669_s1	For this purpose , we compared pre-treatment urinary neopterin levels measured in 92 ovarian cancer patients , with intratumoral levels of mRNA transcripts from factors either involved in the adaptive antitumor immune defense ( CD3 , IFN-Î³ , IRF-1 , IRF-2 , SOCS1 and iNOS ) or immune tolerance ( FoxP3 ) .	
20717669_s2	This study did not reveal an association between urinary neopterin and one of these investigated " on tumor site transcripts " .	
20717669_s3	From all the factors reflecting the magnitude of the local adaptive antitumor response , intratumoral IRF-1 expression above the edge of the 25th percentile was found to predict most reliably favorable progression-free ( median 34 months vs. 10 months ; p &lt ; 0.001 ) and overall ( median 52 months vs. 16 months ; p &lt ; 0.001 ) survival .	
20717669_s4	In contrast , pre-treatment urinary neopterin excretion above 275 Î¼mol/mol creatinine , which indicates an unspecific activation of the innate immune system , was associated with a very poor overall survival with a median of only 11 months when compared with a median overall survival of 40 months in patients with lower urinary neopterin excretion ( p = 0.021 ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
20717669_s5	Interestingly , the considerable survival benefit in patients with high IRF-1-expressing cancers was completely abrogated as well for progression-free as for overall survival when urinary neopterin concentrations were found to be concomitantly elevated .	
20717669_s6	These findings demonstrate that in ovarian carcinomas the unspecific " cancer-related inflammation " contributes to a significant subversion of the adaptive antitumor immune defense mounted at the tumor site .	tumor promoting inflammation
20720310_s0	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA-damage-induced responses are reported frequently to be a risk factor in various cancer types .	
20720310_s1	Here we analysed polymorphisms in 5 genes involved in DNA repair ( XPD Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln , XRCC1 Arg399Gln , APE1 Asp148Glu , NBS1 Glu185Gln , and XPA G-4A ) and in a gene involved in regulation of the cell-cycle ( CCND1 A870G ) .	
20720310_s2	We compared their frequencies in groups of colon , head and neck , and breast cancer patients , and 2 healthy control groups : ( 1 ) matched healthy Polish individuals and ( 2 ) a NCBI database control group .	
20720310_s3	Highly significant differences in the distribution of genotypes of the APE1 , XRCC1 and CCND1 genes were found between colon cancer patients and healthy individuals .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
20720310_s4	The 148Asp APE1 allele and the 399Gln XRCC1 allele apparently increased the risk of colon cancer ( OR = 1.9-2.3 and OR = 1.5-2.1 , respectively ) .	genomic instability and mutation
20720310_s5	Additionally , frequencies of XPD genotypes differed between healthy controls and patients with colon or head and neck cancer .	genomic instability and mutation
20720310_s6	Importantly , no differences in the distribution of these polymorphisms were found between healthy controls and breast cancer patients .	
20720310_s7	The data clearly indicate that the risk of colon cancer is associated with single-nucleotide polymorphism in genes involved in base-excision repair and DNA-damage-induced responses .	genomic instability and mutation
20798497_s0	BACKGROUND In this report , we explored the role of PKCalpha and PKCe as mediators of phorbol 12-myristate13-acetate ( PMA)-induced proliferation in pituitary tumor GH3B6 cells , and determined if the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways were activated .	
20798497_s1	METHODS The GH3B6 cell proliferation was estimated by BrdU incorporation and the cell cycle progression by flow cytometric cell cycle analysis .	
20798497_s2	We determined the expression of PKCalpha and PKCe in membrane and cytosolic fractions by western blotting .	
20798497_s3	The subcellular redistribution of both PKC isozymes was analyzed by confocal microscopy .	
20798497_s4	RESULTS Incubation with PMA for 15 min stimulated PKCalpha and PKCe activation , which was correlated with the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but not Akt .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20798497_s5	The activation of both these PKC isozymes was closely associated with the stimulation of proliferation and the cell cycle progression induced by PMA in GH3B6 cells , an effect that was blocked by the inhibitors of PKCalpha ( GÃ¶6976 ) and PKCe ( eV1-2 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20798497_s6	In addition , the pretreatment with the inhibitor of ERK1/2 ( PD98059 ) prevented the mitogenic activity induced by treatment with PMA for 15 min .	
20798497_s7	CONCLUSION We demonstrated that the activation of PKCalpha and PKCe by phorbol ester in tumor pituitary GH3B6 cells led to cell proliferation and cell cycle progression , effects that involved ERK1/2 activation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20809206_s0	In spite of numerous advances , the 5-year survival rate for head and neck squamous cell cancer has remained largely stagnant and few new anti-tumor drugs have been developed .	
20809206_s1	PCH4 , a derivative of n-butylidenephthalide , has been investigated for its anti-tumor effects on oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) .	
20809206_s2	The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-tumor mechanism of a potential target gene , Nur77 , in OSCC cells , which can be induced by PCH4 treatment .	
20809206_s3	Data show that PCH4 promoted Nur77 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and induced cell apoptosis in OSCC cells .	resisting cell death
20809206_s4	When Nur77 translocation was blocked , the degree of tumor apoptosis caused by PCH4 was significantly inhibited ( pâ&lt;â0.05 ) .	resisting cell death
20809206_s5	Within the MAPK pathway , PCH4 only induced JNK phosphorylation .	
20809206_s6	Furthermore , treatment with a JNK inhibitor significantly reduced PCH4-induced apoptosis ( pâ&lt;â0.05 ) and decreased PCH4-induced Nur77 expression ( pâ&lt;â0.05 ) .	resisting cell death
20809206_s7	In a xenograft animal model , administration of PCH4 also showed anti-tumor effects .	
20809206_s8	We have demonstrated that OSCC cells are sensitive to PCH4 and that Nur77 protein translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm might be associated with the induction of apoptosis by PCH4 .	resisting cell death
20809206_s9	These results indicate that PCH4 may serve as a potential anti-tumor drug for OSCC therapy .	
20809980_s0	INTRODUCTION Natural herbal compounds with novel actions different from existing breast cancer ( BCa ) treatment modalities are attractive for improving therapeutic efficacy and safety .	
20809980_s1	We have recently shown that penta-1,2,3,4,6-O-galloyl-Î²-D-glucose ( PGG ) induced S-phase arrest in prostate cancer ( PCa ) cells through inhibiting DNA replicative synthesis and G(1) arrest , in addition to inducing cell death at higher levels of exposure .	
20809980_s2	We and others have shown that PGG through intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection exerts a strong in vivo growth suppression of human PCa xenograft models in athymic nude mice .	
20809980_s3	This study aims to test the hypothesis that the novel targeting actions of PGG are applicable to BCa cells , especially those lacking proven druggable targets .	
20809980_s4	METHODS Mono-layer cell culture models of p53-wild type estrogen receptor ( ER)-dependent MCF-7 BCa cells and p53-mutant ER-/progesterone receptor ( PR)- and Her2-regular ( triple-negative ) MDA-MB-231 BCa were exposed to PGG for a comprehensive investigation of cellular consequences and molecular targets/mediators .	
20809980_s5	To test the in vivo efficacy , female athymic mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 xenograft were treated with 20mg PGG/kg body weight by daily gavage starting 4 days after cancer cell inoculation .	
20809980_s6	RESULTS Exposure to PGG induced S-phase arrest in both cell lines as indicated by the lack of 5-bromo2'-deoxy-uridine ( BrdU ) incorporation into S-phase cells as well as G(1) arrest .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20809980_s7	Higher levels of PGG induced more caspase-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 , in strong association with induction of P53 Ser(15) phosphorylation , than in MDA-MB-231 cells .	resisting cell death
20809980_s8	The cell cycle arrests were achieved without an induction of cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitory proteins P21(Cip1) and P27(Kip1) .	evading growth suppressors
20809980_s9	PGG treatment led to decreased cyclin D1 in both cell lines and over-expressing cyclin D1 attenuated G(1) arrest and hastened S arrest .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20809980_s10	In serum-starvation synchronized MCF-7 cells , down-regulation of cyclin D1 was associated with de-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma ( Rb ) protein by PGG shortly before G(1)-S transition .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20809980_s11	In vivo , oral administration of PGG led to a greater than 60% inhibition of MDA-MB231 xenograft growth without adverse effect on host body weight .	
20809980_s12	CONCLUSIONS Our in vitro and in vivo data support PGG as a potential drug candidate for breast cancer with novel targeting actions , especially for a triple negative BCa xenograft model .	
20812004_s0	Maintaining the integrity of the cell cycle is critical for ensuring that cells only undergo DNA replication and proliferation under controlled conditions in response to discrete stimuli .	
20812004_s1	One mechanism by which the fidelity of this process is guaranteed is through the activation of cell cycle checkpoints .	
20812004_s2	The mitotic spindle checkpoint , which is regulated by Aurora B kinase , ensures proper kinetochore attachment to chromosomes leading to equal distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells .	
20812004_s3	We demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) cascade regulates mitotic progression and the spindle checkpoint .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20812004_s4	As demonstrated by immunofluorescence at kinetochores , depletion of Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein ( RKIP ) , an inhibitor of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling , causes an increase in MAPK activity that inhibits Aurora B kinase activity .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20812004_s5	By monitoring mitotic index and transit time from nuclear envelope breakdown to anaphase , we demonstrated that RKIP depletion leads to a defective spindle checkpoint and genomic instability , particularly in response to drugs that disrupt microtubule function .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
20812283_s0	Verbascum thapsus commonly known as ' mullein ' is part of a large family of Scrophulariaceae consisting of more than 360 species .	
20812283_s1	From antiquity Verbascum thapsus has been used as a medicinal herb , it contains diverse polysaccharides , iroid glycosides , flavonoids , saponins , volatile oils and phenylentanoids .	
20812283_s2	Inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) represents one of the three isoforms that produce nitric oxide using L-arginine as a substrate in response to an increase in superoxide anion activated by NF-kB .	
20812283_s3	It is implicated in different pathophysiological events and its expression increases greatly during an inflammatory process , due to oxidative stress and the activation of the enzymes of the antioxidant network such as SOD , CAT and GPx.In this study an inflammatory state was reproduced by treating THP-1 cells ( human myelomonocytic leukaemia ) with pro-inflammatory stimuli , such as LPS and IFN-gamma , obtaining an up-regulation both in the expression and in the activity of iNOS .	
20812283_s4	The aim of the work was to investigate the antiinflammatory action of verbascoside using a concentration of 100 mum .	
20812283_s5	The results show a significant decrease of the expression and activity of iNOS , extracellular O(2) ( - ) production , SOD , CAT and GPx activity when the cells were treated with verbascoside .	tumor promoting inflammation
20812283_s6	Based on these results it is hypothesized that verbascoside has antiinflammatory properties since it reduces the production of superoxide radicals and consequently reduces the activity of iNOS .	tumor promoting inflammation
20816008_s0	PURPOSE Idarubicin is a synthetic anthracycline anticancer drug widely used in the treatment of some hematological malignancies .	
20816008_s1	The studies in our laboratory have clearly demonstrated that idarubicin can undergo reductive bioactivation by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase to free radicals with resulting formation of DNA strand breaks , which can potentially contribute to its genotoxic effects [ Celik , H. , ArinÃ§ , E. , Bioreduction of idarubicin and formation of ROS responsible for DNA cleavage by NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and its potential role in the antitumor effect .	
20816008_s2	J Pharm Pharm Sci , 11(4):68-82 , 2008 ] .	
20816008_s3	In the current study , our aim was to investigate the possible protective effects of several phenolic antioxidants , quercetin , rutin , naringenin , resveratrol and trolox , against the DNA-damaging effect of idarubicin originating from its P450 reductase-catalyzed bioactivation .	
20816008_s4	METHODS DNA damage was measured by detecting single-strand breaks in plasmid pBR322 DNA using a cell-free agarose gel method .	
20816008_s5	RESULTS Our results indicated that , among the compounds tested , quercetin was the most potent antioxidant in preventing DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
20816008_s6	Quercetin significantly decreased the extent of DNA strand breaks in a dose-dependent manner ; 100 microM of quercetin almost completely inhibited the DNA strand breakage .	genomic instability and mutation
20816008_s7	Unlike quercetin , its glycosidated conjugate rutin , failed to provide any significant protection against idarubicin-induced DNA strand breaks except at the highest concentration tested ( 2 mM ) .	genomic instability and mutation
20816008_s8	The protective effects of other antioxidants were significantly less than that of quercetin even at high concentrations .	
20816008_s9	Quercetin was found to be also an effective protector against DNA damage induced by mitomycin C. CONCLUSION We conclude that quercetin , one of the most abundant flavonoids in the human diet , is highly effective in reducing the DNA damage caused by the antitumor agents , idarubicin and mitomycin C , following bioactivation by P450 reductase .	genomic instability and mutation
20817674_s0	BACKGROUND Cisplatin chemotherapy often causes acute kidney injury in cancer patients .	
20817674_s1	The causative mechanisms of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury include renal inflammation , activation of p53 tumour suppressor protein and tubular apoptosis .	
20817674_s2	Luteolin , a flavone found in medicinal herbs and plants , has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory , antioxidant and anticarcinogenic activities .	
20817674_s3	The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-apoptotic effect of luteolin on cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury and the molecular mechanism .	
20817674_s4	METHODS C57BL/6 mice were treated with cisplatin ( 20 mg/kg ) with or without treatment with luteolin ( 50 mg/kg for 3 days ) .	
20817674_s5	Renal function , histological changes , degree of oxidative stress and tubular apoptosis were examined .	
20817674_s6	The effects of luteolin on cisplatin-induced expression of renal p53 , PUMA-Î± and Bcl-2 family proteins were evaluated .	
20817674_s7	RESULTS Treatment of mice with cisplatin resulted in renal damage , showing an increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels , tubular damage , oxidative stress and apoptosis .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20817674_s8	Treatment of cisplatin-treated mice with luteolin significantly improved renal dysfunction , reducing tubular cell damage , oxidative stress and apoptosis .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20817674_s9	Examination of molecules involving apoptosis of the kidney revealed that treatment of cisplatin increased the levels of p53 and its phosphorylation , PUMA-Î± , Bax and caspase-3 activity that were significantly decreased by treatment with luteolin .	resisting cell death
20817674_s10	CONCLUSION These results indicate that cisplatin induces acute kidney injury by regulation of p53-dependent renal tubular apoptosis and that luteolin ameliorates the cisplatin-mediated nephrotoxicity through down-regulation of p53-dependent apoptotic pathway in the kidney .	
20839428_s0	A 51-year-old previously healthy man , an ex-smoker , was admitted to the authors ' medical department with a 3-month history of dry cough ; intermittent fever ; painless , ulcerated cutaneous lesions over the trunk and limbs ( Figure 1 ) ; and progressive weight loss .	
20839428_s1	He was of Greek descent .	
20839428_s2	His medical history was remarkable for nasal polyps , which were surgically removed 15 years earlier .	
20839428_s3	Initially , he had been treated with antibiotics , without improvement .	
20839428_s4	Several days before admission , chest radiography revealed pulmonary infiltrates in the left lower lobe .	
20839428_s5	On admission , physical examination revealed a well-orientated man in mild distress , with inspiratory rhonchi at the lower part of the left lung and scattered erythematous nodules of variable size , some of which were ulcerated .	
20839428_s6	Laboratory values were notable for leukopenia , 3.3 x 10(9)/L ; total protein , 5.9 g/dL ; globulin , 2.2 g/dL ; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase , 86 IU/L ; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase , 71 IU/L ; and lactate dehydrogenase , 519 U/L .	
20839428_s7	Computed tomograph ( CT ) of the chest showed multiple alveolar opacities bilaterally ( Figure 2 ) .	
20839428_s8	Fiberoptic bronchoscopy did not reveal any important pathologic findings .	
20839428_s9	Results of bronchial biopsy , cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage , washing , brushing , and sputum following bronchoscopy were negative .	
20839428_s10	CT of the brai and sinonasal area revealed an abnormal low-density mass in the left nasal area .	
20839428_s11	CT findings of the abdomen were negative , as were results of a bone marrow biopsy .	
20839428_s12	There was no evidence of immunosuppression .	avoiding immune destruction
20839428_s13	The differential diagnosis , considering the evidence described , included granulomatous or infectious diseases , angiocentric lymphoproliferative lesions , and lymphomas .	
20839428_s14	Biopsy of a skin lesion showed lymphoproliferative infiltration of the dermis with a follicular and angiocentric growth pattern and regional epidermal necrosis .	resisting cell death
20839428_s15	Immunohistochemical stains showed that the tumor cell were positive for CD56 and CD3 ( cytoplasmic positivity ) and expressed the cytotoxic proteins T-cell intracellular antigen and granzyme B ( Figure 3 ) They lacked TdT , CD34 , CD7 , CD8 , TCL-1 , and CD123 .	
20839428_s16	Findings from an in situ hybridization study for Epstein-Barr virus were negative .	
20839428_s17	Give this result , molecular analysis ofT-cell receptor ( TCR ) gene rearrangements was performed using polymerase chain reaction-based TCR-gamma gene , wit negative results .	
20839428_s18	The morphology and the immunophenotype were consistent with natural killer/T-cell lymphoma , nasal-type .	
20839428_s19	Nasal involvement must be first excluded to proceed to the diagnosis of nasal-type natural killer-cell lymphoma .	
20839428_s20	Indeed , histologic examination of the nasal mass revealed its polypoid nature .	
20839428_s21	Thus , the authors were led to the diagnosis of extranodal extranasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma , nasal-type , CD56-positive , Ep stein-Barr virus-negative , TCR-negative .	
20839428_s22	The patient received combination chemotherapy and completed 4 cycles of cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin vincristine , and prednisone every 14 days for 2 months .	
20839428_s23	Skin lesions improved , and there was no fever soon after the initiation of therapy .	
20839428_s24	Reevaluatio after the fourth cycle , however , disclosed pulmonary infiltrations as well as leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system .	
20839428_s25	The patient had receive systemic salvage chemotherapy and intrathecal infusions of methotrexate .	
20839428_s26	Although the lung lesions had diminished at that time , the patient develope paraplegia , his clinical course rapidly deteriorated , and he eventually died .	
20851879_s0	Progression of breast cancer is associated with remodeling of the extracellular matrix , often involving a switch from estrogen dependence to a dependence on EGF receptor ( EGFR)/HER-2 and is accompanied by increased expression of the main binding protein for insulin-like growth factors ( IGFBP-3 ) .	
20851879_s1	We have examined the effects of IGFBP-3 on EGF responses of breast epithelial cells in the context of changes in the extracellular matrix .	
20851879_s2	On plastic and laminin with MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells , EGF and IGFBP-3 each increased cell growth and together produced a synergistic response , whereas with T47D breast cancer cells IGFBP-3 alone had no effect , but the ability of EGF to increase cell proliferation was markedly inhibited in the presence of IGFBP-3 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20851879_s3	In contrast on fibronectin with MCF-10A cells , IGFBP-3 alone inhibited cell growth and blocked EGF-induced proliferation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20851879_s4	With the cancer cells , IGFBP-3 alone had no effect but enhanced the EGF-induced increase in cell growth .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20851879_s5	The insulin-like growth factor-independent effects of IGFBP-3 alone on cell proliferation were completely abrogated in the presence of an EGFR , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , Iressa .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20851879_s6	Although IGFBP-3 did not affect EGFR phosphorylation [ Tyr(1068) ] , it was found to modulate receptor internalization and was associated with activation of Rho and subsequent changes in MAPK phosphorylation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20851879_s7	The levels of fibronectin and IGFBP-3 within breast tumors may determine their dependence on EGFR and their response to therapies targeting this receptor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20854069_s0	AIMS Treatment decisions are difficult in clinically localised prostate cancer and further biomarkers of aggressive behaviour are required .	
20854069_s1	We investigated the hypothesis that the tissue expression of three cell cycle markers , Rb , p21 and p16 , would provide helpful prognostic information in a well characterised series of prostate cancers which were clinically localised and treated conservatively .	
20854069_s2	METHODS The immunohistochemical staining expression of these markers was assessed in tissue microarrays and correlated with 10 year prostate cancer survival and overall survival and then compared with pathological data including contemporary Gleason score , age , measures of tumour extent and initial serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level .	
20854069_s3	RESULTS Rb overexpression did not show any significant association with Gleason score or prostate cancer survival. p21 protein expression showed a significant association with prostate cancer survival ( pâ=â0.02 ) and overall survival ( pâ=â0.01 ) in a univariate model but not in a multivariate model with pathological and serum PSA data .	evading growth suppressors
20854069_s4	There was a significant association between p16 cytoplasmic expression and prostate cancer survival ( HRâ=â2.52 , 95%CIâ= 1.79-3.55 , pâ&lt;â0.001 ) and overall survival ( HRâ= 1.54 , 95% CIâ=â1.20-1.98 , pâ=â0.001 ) in a univariate model. p16 expression remained an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer survival ( HRâ=â1.50 , 95%CIâ=â1.05-2.14 , pâ=â0.03 ) .	evading growth suppressors
20854069_s5	CONCLUSION We conclude that p16 cytoplasmic expression can be used as a predictor of outcome in conservatively treated prostate cancer .	
20854069_s6	Rb and p21 show no independent association with outcome and therefore further research is not warranted .	
20856226_s0	Cytokeratin ( CK ) 19-positive hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) has been reported to have a poor prognosis .	
20856226_s1	The mechanism of the development of CK19-positive HCC remains to be studied .	
20856226_s2	To clarify this , in vitro experiments were performed using human HCC cell lines ( PLC-5 , HepG2 ) , and the phenotypic changes after stimulation with several growth factors were examined using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR , western blotting , and immunofluorescence staining .	
20856226_s3	In vivo experiments using human HCC specimens obtained from a total of 78 patients and clinicopathological analysis were also performed .	
20856226_s4	Among the growth factors tested , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) had prominent effects on inducing CK19 expression in PLC-5 and HepG2 , which was accompanied by the reduced expression of Î±-fetoprotein in PLC-5 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20856226_s5	The induction of CK19 expression after EGF stimulation was accompanied by the phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase ( JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase , which was blocked by the addition of JNK inhibitors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20856226_s6	EGF also increased proliferative abilities and invasive properties of the HCC cell lines .	activating invasion and metastasis
20856226_s7	In vivo , 9 ( 12% ) of 78 HCC cases showed positive immunohistochemical staining of CK19 .	
20856226_s8	The extent of positive immunohistochemical signals of EGF , EGF receptor ( EGFR ) , and JNK expression was significantly intense in CK-19-positive HCC than those of CK19-negative HCC .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20856226_s9	Clinicopathological analysis showed that CK19-positive HCC had a high incidence of portal vein invasion , extrahepatic metastasis and an early relapse , which was associated with the worsened 2-year disease free survival .	activating invasion and metastasis
20856226_s10	These results indicate that the activation of the EGF-EGFR signaling pathway is associated with the development of CK19-positive HCC , and the EGF-induced increase in growth abilities of HCC may account for the poor prognosis of the patients .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20862378_s0	In this study , we compared the effects of SKI-606 with Iressa , Src/Abl and EGF-R kinase inhibitors , respectively , on selected parameters in HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines , which express E6/E7 oncoproteins of high-risk HPV types 18 and 16 , respectively .	
20862378_s1	Our results show that SKI-606 and Iressa inhibit cell proliferation and provoke G(0)-G(1) cell cycle arrest and reduction of S and G(2)-M phase using 2 and 5âÎ¼M concentrations of these inhibitors .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20862378_s2	In contrast , SKI-606 induces differentiation to an epithelial phenotype " mesenchymal-epithelial transition " ; thus SKI-606 causes a dramatic decrease in cell motility and invasion abilities of HeLa and SiHa cancer cells , in comparison to untreated cells and Iressa-treated cells in which these parameters are only slightly affected .	activating invasion and metastasis
20862378_s3	These changes are accompanied by a regulation of the expression patterns of E-cadherin and catenins .	
20862378_s4	The molecular pathway analysis of Src/Abl inhibitor revealed that SKI-606 blocks the phosphorylation of Î²-catenin and consequently converts its role from a transcriptional regulator to a cell-cell adhesion molecule .	
20862378_s5	Our findings indicate that SKI-606 inhibits signaling pathways involved in regulating tumor cell migration and invasion genes via Î²-catenin alteration , suggesting that Src inhibitor , in comparison to EGF-R , is a promising therapeutic agent for human cervical cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis
20876800_s0	Unlike the growth factor dependence of normal cells , cancer cells can maintain growth factor-independent glycolysis and survival through expression of oncogenic kinases , such as BCR-Abl .	
20876800_s1	Although targeted kinase inhibition can promote cancer cell death , therapeutic resistance develops frequently , and further mechanistic understanding is needed .	
20876800_s2	Cell metabolism may be central to this cell death pathway , as we have shown that growth factor deprivation leads to decreased glycolysis that promotes apoptosis via p53 activation and induction of the proapoptotic protein Puma .	
20876800_s3	Here , we extend these findings to show that elevated glucose metabolism , characteristic of cancer cells , can suppress protein kinase CÎ´ ( PKCÎ´)-dependent p53 activation to maintain cell survival after growth factor withdrawal .	cellular energetics,sustaining proliferative signaling
20876800_s4	In contrast , DNA damage-induced p53 activation was PKCÎ´ independent and was not metabolically sensitive .	genomic instability and mutation
20876800_s5	Both stresses required p53 Ser(18) phosphorylation for maximal activity but led to unique patterns of p53 target gene expression , showing distinct activation and response pathways for p53 that were differentially regulated by metabolism .	
20876800_s6	Consistent with oncogenic kinases acting to replace growth factors , treatment of BCR-Abl-expressing cells with the kinase inhibitor imatinib led to reduced metabolism and p53- and Puma-dependent cell death .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20876800_s7	Accordingly , maintenance of glucose uptake inhibited p53 activation and promoted imatinib resistance .	
20876800_s8	Furthermore , inhibition of glycolysis enhanced imatinib sensitivity in BCR-Abl-expressing cells with wild-type p53 but had little effect on p53-null cells .	cellular energetics
20876800_s9	These data show that distinct pathways regulate p53 after DNA damage and metabolic stress and that inhibiting glucose metabolism may enhance the efficacy of and overcome resistance to targeted molecular cancer therapies .	cellular energetics,genomic instability and mutation
20876804_s0	Aberrant expression and polymorphism of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 ( FGFR4 ) has been linked to tumor progression and anticancer drug resistance .	
20876804_s1	We describe here a novel mechanism of tumor progression by matrix degradation involving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in response to membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase ( MT1-MMP , MMP-14 ) induction at the edge of tumors expressing the FGFR4-R388 risk variant .	activating invasion and metastasis
20876804_s2	Both FGFR4 and MT1-MMP were upregulated in tissue biopsies from several human cancer types including breast adenocarcinomas , where they were partially coexpressed at the tumor/stroma border and tumor invasion front .	
20876804_s3	The strongest overall coexpression was found in prostate carcinoma .	
20876804_s4	Studies with cultured prostate carcinoma cell lines showed that the FGFR4-R388 variant , which has previously been associated with poor cancer prognosis , increased MT1-MMP-dependent collagen invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
20876804_s5	In this experimental model , knockdown of FGFR4-R388 or MT1-MMP by RNA interference blocked tumor cell invasion and growth in collagen .	activating invasion and metastasis
20876804_s6	This was coupled with impaired phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2 and Src , upregulation of E-cadherin , and suppression of cadherin-11 and N-cadherin .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20876804_s7	These in vitro results were substantiated by reduced MT1-MMP content and in vivo growth of prostate carcinoma cells after the FGFR4-R388 gene silencing .	
20876804_s8	In contrast , knockdown of the alternative FGFR4-G388 allele enhanced MT1-MMP and invasive tumor cell growth in vivo and within three-dimensional collagen .	activating invasion and metastasis
20876804_s9	These results will help to explain the reported association of the FGFR4-R388 variant with the progression and poor prognosis of certain types of tumors .	
20878069_s0	Current palliative chemotherapy ( CT ) regimens achieve clinical benefits in less than 50% of patients treated for metastatic gastric cancers , and long-term survivals are anecdotical .	
20878069_s1	Genetic polymorphisms and differences at the level of transcription in genes involved in biological processes of drug metabolism , DNA repair and drug resistance can explain the observed individual differences in response to drugs , in survival and in different susceptibility to the toxic effects of CT .	
20878069_s2	The possibility to classify patients on the basis of genetic signatures could help in choosing the CT regimen .	
20878069_s3	We present herein an analysis of genetic and expression profiling of three patients affected by metastatic gastric cancer , treated with CT and alive , disease-free , at 66-82 months .	
20878069_s4	Four patients with typical clinical outcome represented the control group .	
20878069_s5	Expression profiling from paraffin-embedded tumor tissues was performed on an ad hoc set of genes involved in drug metabolism and resistance , DNA repair , cell cycle regulation and growth factors signalling .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
20878069_s6	Genetic polymorphism analysis on DNA extracted from peripheral blood was done by pyrosequencing of genetic markers predictive of drug response .	
20878069_s7	Expression analysis in long-term survivors revealed a significant upregulation of PTEN , TP63 , GADD45a and MAPK1 genes .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20878069_s8	We found also an upregulation of CYP1A1 , CYP3A4 and ERBB4 genes .	
20878069_s9	EGF was found to be down-regulated in long-term survivors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20878069_s10	ERCC1 C8092A polymorphism seems to be associated with survival in our set of patients .	
20878069_s11	The present study shed light on a set of genes , which could have a predictive role in survival of patients with metastatic gastric tumors .	
20880961_s0	Cancer cells undergo multi-step processes in obtaining the ability to metastasize , and are constantly exposed to signals that induce apoptosis .	
20880961_s1	Acquisition of anti-apoptotic properties by cancer cells is important for metastasis , and recent studies suggest that transforming growth factor ( TGF)-Î² promotes the survival of certain types of cancer cells .	
20880961_s2	Here , we found that in highly metastatic breast cancer cells , JygMC(A) , JygMC(B) and 4T1 , TGF-Î² ligands were produced in autocrine fashion .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20880961_s3	Pharmacological inhibition of endogenous TGF-Î² signalling by a TGF-Î² type I receptor kinase inhibitor in serum-free conditions increased the expression of BH3-only protein , Bim ( also known as Bcl2-like 11 ) in JygMC(A) and JygMC(B) cells , and caused apoptotic cell death .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20880961_s4	We also found that induction of Bim by TGF-Î² was not observed in Foxc1 knocked-down cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20880961_s5	These findings suggest that TGF-Î² plays a crucial role in the regulation of survival of certain types of cancer cells through the TGF-Î²-Foxc1-Bim pathway , and that specific inhibitors of TGF-Î² signalling might be useful as apoptosis inducers in breast cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20881612_s0	Hypoxiaâreoxygenation ( HR ) is a primary driver of angiogenesis in both atherogenesis and tumorigenesis .	
20881612_s1	The main target of hypoxia-driven proangiogenic signaling is adherens junctions responsible for contact inhibition of endothelial cells .	
20881612_s2	We analyzed the effects of hypoxia ( 8â12 hours ) followed by a brief period of reoxygenation ( 2 hours ) ( HR ) on angiogenesis and integrity of adherens junction in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells as well as the effects of aspirin on modulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ' response to HR .	
20881612_s3	Cells exposed to HR displayed considerable enhancement of tube formation ( angiogenesis ) on matrigel .	inducing angiogenesis
20881612_s4	Immunocytostaining of near-confluent cells revealed that HR caused disruption of adherens junctions and internalization of their components VE-cadherin , p120 catenin , and b-catenin .	
20881612_s5	Additionally , HR resulted in the appearance of binucleated cells , and VE-cadherin in colocalization with b-catenin was found to be positioned between the separating nuclei .	
20881612_s6	Presence of aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid , 1 mM ) resulted in preservation of adherens junctions on the cellular membrane and prevented angiogenesis as well as mitosis .	inducing angiogenesis
20881612_s7	HR caused upregulation LOX-1 , the p47(phox) subunit of NADPH , while reducing transcription of endothelial nitric oxide synthase .	
20881612_s8	Aspirin had no effect on endothelial nitric oxide synthase and canceled the transcriptional activation of the LOX-1 and p47(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase .	
20881612_s9	Based on these data , we hypothesize that aspirin preserves the integrity of adherens junctions and thus blunts angiogenic response to HR through downregulation of LOX-1 and the LOX-1-mediated p47(phox) component of NADPH oxidase transcription , thus preventing NADPH oxidase assembly and function .	
20882892_s0	Myxoid leiomyosarcoma is an extremely rare variant of leiomyosarcoma , masquerading almost to perfection as a benign lesion .	
20882892_s1	For , indeed , the tumor lacks the defining features of high mitotic activity , cellular atypia or necrosis , and the microscopic picture is dominated by abundant myxoid stroma containing sparse spindle cells .	resisting cell death
20882892_s2	We report here such a case occurring in the uterus and discuss the differential diagnosis .	
20882892_s3	The relevant literature is reviewed .	
20889718_s0	Estrogen receptor Î± ( ERÎ± ) expression in breast cancer is predictive of response to endocrine therapy ; however , resistance is common in ERÎ±-positive tumors that overexpress the growth factor receptor ERBB2 .	
20889718_s1	Even in the absence of estrogen , ERÎ± can be activated by growth factors , including the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) .	
20889718_s2	EGF induces a transcriptional program distinct from estrogen ; however , the mechanism of the stimulus-specific response is unknown .	
20889718_s3	Here we show that the EGF-induced ERÎ± genomic targets , its cistromes , are distinct from those induced by estrogen in a process dependent on the transcription factor AP-1 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20889718_s4	The EGF-induced ERÎ± cistrome specifically regulates genes found overexpressed in ERBB2-positive human breast cancers .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20889718_s5	This provides a potential molecular explanation for the endocrine therapy resistance seen in ERÎ±-positive breast cancers that overexpress ERBB2 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20889718_s6	These results suggest a central role for ERÎ± in hormone-refractory breast tumors dependent on growth factor pathway activation and favors the development of therapeutic strategies completely antagonizing ERÎ± , as opposed to blocking its estrogen responsiveness alone .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20923189_s0	The aim of this study was to determine whether isorhamnetin , an immediate 3'-O-methylated metabolite of quercetin , affects proliferation , cell death , and the cell cycle of human colon carcinoma ( HCT-116 ) cells .	
20923189_s1	Isorhamnetin was found to be a potent antiproliferative agent in a dose- and time-dependent manner , with an IC50 of 72 Î¼M after 48 h of incubation as estimated by MTT assay .	
20923189_s2	Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that isorhamnetin exerted a stimulatory effect on apoptosis and necrosis .	resisting cell death
20923189_s3	Isorhamnetin also increased the number of cells in G2/M phase .	evading growth suppressors
20923189_s4	Serum deprivation appeared to potentiate the effects of isorhamnetin on cell death and facilitated cell cycle progression to G0/G1 phase .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20923189_s5	These results suggest that isorhamnetin might mediate inhibition of HCT-116 cell growth through the perturbation of cell cycle progression and are consistent with the notion that G2/M checkpoints could be a conserved target for flavonoids in human colon cancer cells , leading to apoptotic and necrotic death .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
20923189_s6	These antiproliferative , apoptotic , necrotic , and cell cycle effects suggest that isorhamnetin may have clinically significant therapeutic and chemopreventive capabilities .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
20923189_s7	To our knowledge , this is the first report of the effect of isorhamnetin on human colon cancer cells .	
20925001_s0	Spindle cell oncocytoma ( SCO ) of the pituitary gland is a relatively recently established , very rare subtype of adenohypophysis tumours that was introduced as a distinct clinicopathological entity in the fourth edition of WHO classification of the central nervous system tumours ( 2007 ) .	
20925001_s1	It is non-endocrine neoplasm of the anterior pituitary that occurs in adults and usually follows a benign clinical course , corresponding to WHO grade I. Up to now , pituitary SCO have been reported occasionally and only 14 cases of SCO have been documented in the literature .	
20925001_s2	Because of their rarity , the pathogenesis and natural history of these tumours have not been fully characterized .	
20925001_s3	We report two additional cases of SCO occurring in females aged 63 years ( Case 1 ) and 65 years ( Case 2 ) , who presented with pan-hypopituitarism , headache and visual field defect .	
20925001_s4	In both cases , the magnetic resonance imaging showed solid sellar mass of moderate size with suprasellar extension .	
20925001_s5	The clinical and radiological features suggested non-functioning pituitary macroadenomas without evidence of invasive growth .	
20925001_s6	One patient presented with tumour recurrence 3 years after undergoing the previous surgical removal of tumour , which was initially misdiagnosed as schwannoma .	
20925001_s7	The first tumour was removed by transsphenoidal surgery and the second one by frontal craniotomy .	
20925001_s8	Histologically and immunohistochemically , both tumours displayed the features typical for SCO of the pituitary .	
20925001_s9	They were composed of interwoven fascicles of spindle cells exhibiting abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm of oncocytic or granular appearance .	
20925001_s10	Mitoses were rarely observed and necrosis was absent .	resisting cell death
20925001_s11	In one case , the advanced lymphocytic infliltration was observed within neoplastic tissue .	
20925001_s12	The tumour cells exhibited immunoreactivity for S-100 protein , galectin-3 , vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen but they were negative for GFAP , anterior pituitary neuroendocrine markers ( prolactin , growth hormone , TSH , ACTH , FSH , LH ) , chromogranin , synaptophysin , cytokeratin CK ( AE1/AE3 ) , smooth muscle actin , desmin , CD34 and CD68 .	
20925001_s13	MIB1 labeling index did not exceed 10% .	
20925001_s14	Ultrastructurally , the tumour cells were rich in mitochondria with lamellar cristae .	
20925001_s15	Moreover , in Case 2 some tumour cells showed a number of giant mitochondria with severely destructed internal matrix .	
20925001_s16	Spindle cell oncocytoma of the anterior pituitary is often misdiagnosed entity of uncertain histogenesis .	
20925001_s17	It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of various sellar-region lesions of oncocytic morphology .	
20927103_s0	Reciprocity of inflammation , oxidative stress and neovascularization is emerging as an important mechanism underlying numerous processes from tissue healing and remodelling to cancer progression .	
20927103_s1	Whereas the mechanism of hypoxia-driven angiogenesis is well understood , the link between inflammation-induced oxidation and de novo blood vessel growth remains obscure .	
20927103_s2	Here we show that the end products of lipid oxidation , Ï-(2-carboxyethyl)pyrrole ( CEP ) and other related pyrroles , are generated during inflammation and wound healing and accumulate at high levels in ageing tissues in mice and in highly vascularized tumours in both murine and human melanoma .	tumor promoting inflammation
20927103_s3	The molecular patterns of carboxyalkylpyrroles are recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) , but not TLR4 or scavenger receptors on endothelial cells , leading to an angiogenic response that is independent of vascular endothelial growth factor .	inducing angiogenesis
20927103_s4	CEP promoted angiogenesis in hindlimb ischaemia and wound healing models through MyD88-dependent TLR2 signalling .	
20927103_s5	Neutralization of endogenous carboxyalkylpyrroles impaired wound healing and tissue revascularization and diminished tumour angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
20927103_s6	Both TLR2 and MyD88 are required for CEP-induced stimulation of Rac1 and endothelial migration .	
20927103_s7	Taken together , these findings establish a new function of TLR2 as a sensor of oxidation-associated molecular patterns , providing a key link connecting inflammation , oxidative stress , innate immunity and angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis,tumor promoting inflammation
20927195_s0	BACKGROUND Human Barrett's cancer cell lines have numerous , poorly-characterized genetic abnormalities and , consequently , those lines have limited utility as models for studying the early molecular events in carcinogenesis .	
20927195_s1	Cell lines with well-defined genetic lesions that recapitulate various stages of neoplastic progression in Barrett's esophagus would be most useful for such studies .	
20927195_s2	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To develop such model cell lines , we started with telomerase-immortalized , non-neoplastic Barrett's epithelial ( BAR-T ) cells , which are spontaneously deficient in p16 , and proceeded to knock down p53 using RNAi , to activate Ras by introducing oncogenic H-Ras(G12V) , or both .	
20927195_s3	BAR-T cells infected with either p53 RNAi or oncogenic H-Ras(G12V) alone maintained cell-to-cell contact inhibition and did not exhibit anchorage-independent growth in soft agar .	evading growth suppressors
20927195_s4	In contrast , the combination of p53 RNAi knockdown with expression of oncogenic H-Ras(G12V) transformed the p16-deficient BAR-T cells , as evidenced by their loss of contact inhibition , by their formation of colonies in soft agar , and by their generation of tumors in immunodeficient mice .	evading growth suppressors
20927195_s5	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Through these experiments , we have generated a number of transformed and non-transformed cell lines with well-characterized genetic abnormalities recapitulating various stages of carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus .	
20927195_s6	These lines should be useful models for the study of carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus , and for testing the efficacy of chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents .	
20930550_s0	Autophagy is one of the survival processes of cancer cells , especially in stressful conditions such as starvation , hypoxia and chemotherapeutic agents .	
20930550_s1	However , its roles in tumor survival have not yet been fully elucidated .	
20930550_s2	Here , we found for the first time that JAK2/STAT3 was activated in HeLa cells when they were starved or treated with rapamycin .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20930550_s3	STAT3 activation was associated with autophagic processes , because it was completely inhibited by 3-methyladenine , partially inhibited by knockdown of molecules associated with autophagic processes and blocked by antioxidants , DPI , a Nox inhibitor and knockdown of p22 phox , indicating that ROS generated by Nox that was activated during autophagic processes activated JAK2/STAT3 pathway .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20930550_s4	Activated STAT3 directly bound to IL6 promoter and increased IL6 mRNA and protein secretion .	
20930550_s5	Finally , the conditioned media , which included IL6 , from starved HeLa cells promoted cancer cell survival in both normal and starved conditions , confirmed by clonogenic , proliferation and cell death assays .	
20930550_s6	These data together indicate that the autophagic process in cancer cells can contribute to their survival by JAk2/STAT3 activation and subsequent secretion of growth factors .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20932246_s0	Diallyl disulfide ( DADS ) is a major organo-sulfur compound derived from garlic ( Allium sativum ) , which inhibits the proliferation of various types of cancer cells .	
20932246_s1	In this study we investigated the effect of DADS on the induction of apoptosis , as well as its regulatory effect on the activation of transcription factors in B16F-10 melanoma cells .	
20932246_s2	Treatment of B16F-10 cells with nontoxic concentrations of DADS resulted in the presence of apoptotic bodies and induced DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner .	resisting cell death
20932246_s3	Cell-cycle analysis revealed that the occurrence of the sub-G1 peak was significantly elevated in DADS-treated cells .	
20932246_s4	DADS treatment also down-reguated Bcl-2 expression and up-regulated p53 , caspase-9 , and caspase-3 expression in B16F-10 melanoma cells .	resisting cell death
20932246_s5	The study also reveals that DADS inhibited the activation and nuclear translocation of p65 , p50 , and c-Rel subunits of nuclear factor ( NF)-B and other transcription factors , such as c-fos , activated transcription factor-2 , and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein , in B16F-10 melanoma cells The pro-inflammatory cytokine production and gene expression of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-Î± , interleukin ( IL)-1Î² , IL-6 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) were down-regulated in DADS-treated cells compared with control B16F-10 metastatic melanoma cells .	tumor promoting inflammation
20932246_s6	DADS induces caspase-dependent apoptosis through a mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway in B16F-10 melanoma cells by activating p53 and caspase-3 gene expression and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-B-mediated Bcl-2 activation .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20932474_s0	Ultraviolet ( UV ) light induces DNA-damage checkpoints and mutagenesis , which are involved in cancer protection and tumorigenesis , respectively .	
20932474_s1	How cells identify DNA lesions and convert them to checkpoint-activating structures is a major question .	
20932474_s2	We show that during repair of UV lesions in noncycling cells , Exo1-mediated processing of nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) intermediates competes with repair DNA synthesis .	genomic instability and mutation
20932474_s3	Impediments of the refilling reaction allow Exo1 to generate extended ssDNA gaps , detectable by electron microscopy , which drive Mec1 kinase activation and will be refilled by long-patch repair synthesis , as shown by DNA combing .	genomic instability and mutation
20932474_s4	We provide evidence that this mechanism maybe stimulated by closely opposing UV lesions , represents a strategy to redirect problematic repair intermediates to alternative repair pathways , and may also be extended to physically different DNA damages .	genomic instability and mutation
20932474_s5	Our work has significant implications for understanding the coordination between repair of DNA lesions and checkpoint pathways to preserve genome stability .	genomic instability and mutation
20936128_s0	Base analogs are powerful antimetabolites and dangerous mutagens generated endogenously by oxidative stress , inflammation , and aberrant nucleotide biosynthesis .	
20936128_s1	Human inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase ( ITPA ) hydrolyzes triphosphates of noncanonical purine bases ( i.e. , ITP , dITP , XTP , dXTP , or their mimic : 6-hydroxyaminopurine ( HAP ) deoxynucleoside triphosphate ) and thus regulates nucleotide pools and protects cells from DNA damage .	
20936128_s2	We demonstrate that the model purine base analog HAP induces DNA breaks in human cells and leads to elevation of levels of ITPA .	genomic instability and mutation
20936128_s3	A human polymorphic allele of the ITPA , 94C-&gt;A encodes for the enzyme with a P32T amino-acid change and leads to accumulation of nonhydrolyzed ITP .	
20936128_s4	The polymorphism has been associated with adverse reaction to purine base-analog drugs .	
20936128_s5	The level of both spontaneous and HAP-induced DNA breaks is elevated in the cell line with the ITPA P32T variant .	genomic instability and mutation
20936128_s6	The results suggested that human ITPA plays a pivotal role in the protection of DNA from noncanonical purine base analogs .	
20939432_s0	Overexpression of the melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 ( MDA-7)/IL-24 in vitro generally results in the growth suppression and induction of apoptosis of diverse human tumor cells .	
20939432_s1	In this study , we investigated the effects of overexpression of the MDA-7/IL-24 gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells in vitro and in vivo .	
20939432_s2	Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MDA-7 facilitated the MDA-7/IL-24-induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest in HCC cells , but not in the normal liver cell line L02 , and the effect was independent of the p53 status .	evading growth suppressors
20939432_s3	Inhibition of metastasis and angiogenesis was correlated with decreasing expression of STAT3 , P-STAT3 , MMP-2 , VEGF , and TGF-beta genes , regulated by STAT3 in MHCCLM6 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
20939432_s4	We also showed that Ad.mda-7 combined with doxorubicin ( ADM ) had significantly enhanced antitumor and antimetastatic effects in vivo , accompanied by the downregulation of VEGF , MMP-2 , and TGF-beta genes and the upregulation of E-cadherin genes .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
20939432_s5	These data suggested that MDA-7/IL-24 induces its selective antitumor properties in HCC cells by promoting apoptosis independent of p53 status , inhibiting subcutaneous tumor growth and metastasis , and increasing the effect of chemotherapeutic agents .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
20939432_s6	MDA-7/IL-24 represents a new class of cancer suppressor genes that may be useful in the targeted therapy of HCC .	
20948210_s0	BACKGROUND Ginkgolic acids ( GAs ) , extracted from the seed coat of Ginkgo biloba L. Our previous study has shown that GA monomer could inhibit the growth of Hep-2 significantly and induce the fragmentation of the chromosomal DNA .	
20948210_s1	To further assess the antitumor potential and turn it into a candidate new antitumor drug , the antitumor mechanism of GA was investigated .	
20948210_s2	METHOD The cytotoxicity and antitumor effect of GA monomer were assayed by MTT colorimetric assay with nontumorogenic MC-3T3-E1 as well as tumorogenic Hep-2 and Tac8113 cell lines .	
20948210_s3	The effect of GA monomer on the proliferation of tumor cell lines was analyzed with MTT colorimetric and CFSE labeled assay .	
20948210_s4	Cell cycle distribution and measurement of the percentage of apoptotic cells were performed by flow cytometry following stained with propidium iodide , annexin V-FITC .	
20948210_s5	The expression of apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 , Bax and caspase-3 was analyzed with Western blot .	
20948210_s6	RESULT GA only inhibited the growth of tumorogenic cell lines in a both dose- and time-dependent manner .	
20948210_s7	Tumor cells were treated with GA for 72 h , 70.53 Â± 4.54% Hep-2 and 63.5 Â± 7.2% Tca8113 cells were retarded at GO/G1 phase , and the percentage of apoptosis was 40.4 Â± 1.58 and 38.4 Â± 1.7% , respectively .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
20948210_s8	GA-treated activated caspase-3 downregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax protein , eventually leading to a decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in tumor cells .	resisting cell death
20948210_s9	CONCLUSIONS The antitumor action of GA was due to inhibiting the proliferation in a manner of inhibiting division , retarding the progress of cell cycle and inducing apoptosis , making GA a candidate as new antitumor drug .	
20953816_s0	The multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib induced a variable but significant decrease of viability in both p53(wild-type) ( EHEB , JVM-2 , JVM-3 ) and p53(mutated) ( MEC-1 , MEC-2 , BJAB ) prolymphocytic B leukemic cells , due to a combination of cell cycle block in G1 and apoptosis .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
20953816_s1	Antibody phospho-kinase array analysis revealed that dasatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of various kinases , including ERK1/2 and p38/MAPK as well as of STAT3 transcription factors , in both p53(wild-type) and p53(mutated) cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20953816_s2	Therefore , dasatinib might offer a novel therapeutic strategy not only for p53(wild-type) , but also for p53(mutated) B malignancies that have the worst prognosis and urgently need innovative therapeutic approaches .	
20954073_s0	Ceramide induces cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death associated with increased levels of p27(kip1) .	
20954073_s1	The aim of this study was to examine the effects of ceramide on p27(kip1) protein levels as a measure of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis .	
20954073_s2	Results showed that ceramide increased p27(kip1) protein levels through activation of protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) in PC-3 prostate cancer cells .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20954073_s3	Treatment of cells with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid or with PP2A-CÎ± siRNA inhibited ceramide-induced enhanced p27(kip1) protein expression and Akt dephosphorylation , and prevented Skp2 downregulation .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20954073_s4	Overexpression of constitutively active Akt attenuated ceramide-induced Skp2 downregulation and p27(kip1) upregulation .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20954073_s5	In addition , ceramide stimulated binding of the PP2A catalytic subunit PP2A-CÎ±Î² to Akt as assessed by immunoprecipitation experiments , indicating that PP2A is involved in the induction of p27(kip1) via inhibition of Akt pathway .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20954073_s6	Finally , whether PP2A can regulate p27(kip1) expression independently of Akt pathway was determined .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20954073_s7	Knockdown of PP2A-CÎ± with siRNA reduced p27(kip1) levels in the presence of Akt inhibitor .	evading growth suppressors
20954073_s8	These data reveal that PP2A is a regulator of ceramide-induced p27(kip1) expression via Akt-dependent and Akt-independent pathways .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20957523_s0	SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 ( SMYD3 ) is a histone methyltransferase that plays an important role in transcriptional regulation in human carcinogenesis .	
20957523_s1	It can specifically methylate histone H3 at lysine 4 and activate the transcription of a set of downstream genes , including several oncogenes ( e.g. , N-myc , CrkL , Wnt10b , RIZ and hTERT ) and genes involved in the control of cell cycle ( e.g. , CyclinG1 and CDK2 ) and signal transduction ( e.g. , STAT1 , MAP3K11 and PIK3CB ) .	
20957523_s2	To determine the effects of SMYD3 over-expression on cell proliferation , we transfected SMYD3 into MDA-MB-231 cells and found that these cells showed several transformed phenotypes as demonstrated by colony growth in soft agar .	
20957523_s3	Besides , we show here that down-regulation of SMYD3 could induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest , indicating the potent induction of apoptosis by SMYD3 knockdown .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
20957523_s4	These results suggest the regulatory mechanisms of SMYD3 on the acceleration of cell cycle and facilitate the development of strategies that may inhibit the progression of cell cycle in breast cancer cells .	evading growth suppressors
20959490_s0	Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 ( Stat3 ) is activated by cytokines and growth factors in lung cancers and regulates expression of genes implicated in cell growth , survival , and transformation .	
20959490_s1	Previously , we found that mice with a deletion of the G protein-coupled receptor , family C , group 5 , member a ( Gprc5a ) gene develop lung tumors , indicating that Gprc5a is a tumor suppressor .	
20959490_s2	Herein , we show that epithelial cells from Gprc5a knockout mouse lung ( Gprc5a(-/-) cells ) survive better in vitro in medium deprived of exogenous growth factors and form more colonies in semisolid medium than their counterparts from wild-type mice ( Gprc5a(+/+) cells ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20959490_s3	Stat3 tyrosine 705 phosphorylation and expression of several Stat3-regulated antiapoptotic genes were higher in Gprc5a(-/-) than in Gprc5a(+/+) cells .	
20959490_s4	Both cell types secreted leukemia inhibitory factor ( Lif ) ; however , whereas Stat3 activation was persistent in Gprc5a(-/-) cells , it was transient in Gprc5a(+/+) cells .	
20959490_s5	Lung adenocarcinoma cells isolated from Gprc5a(-/-) mice also exhibited autocrine Lif-mediated Stat3 activation .	
20959490_s6	The level of Socs3 , the endogenous Stat3 inhibitory protein , was higher in Gprc5a(+/+) than in Gprc5a(-/-) cells , and expression of the tumor suppressor stabilized Socs3 .	
20959490_s7	Inhibition of Stat3 signaling in Gprc5a(-/-) normal and cancer cells by the Janus-activated kinase 2 inhibitor AG490 or by a dominant negative Stat3(Y705F) increased starvation-induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation .	
20959490_s8	These results show that persistent Stat3 activation is important for the survival and transformation of Gprc5a(-/-) lung cells and suggest that the tumor suppressive effects of Gprc5a are mediated , at least in part , by inhibition of Stat3 signaling through Socs3 stabilization .	
20964820_s0	INTRODUCTION During selective segregation of DNA , a cell asymmetrically divides and retains its template DNA .	
20964820_s1	Asymmetric division yields daughter cells whose genome reflects that of the parents ' , simultaneously protecting the parental cell from genetic errors that may occur during DNA replication .	
20964820_s2	We hypothesized that long-lived epithelial cells are present in immortal , premalignant cell populations , undergo asymmetric division , retain their template DNA strands , and cycle both during allometric growth and during pregnancy .	
20964820_s3	METHODS The glands of 3-week old immune competent Balb/C female mice were utilized intact or cleared of host epithelium and implanted with ductal-limited , lobule-limited , or alveolar-ductal progenitor cells derived from COMMA-D1 pre-malignant epithelial cells. 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine ( 5-BrdU ) was administered to identify those cells which retain their template DNA .	
20964820_s4	Nulliparous mice were then either injected with [ (3)H]-thymidine ( (3)H-TdR ) to distinguish 5-BrdU-label retaining cells that enter the cell cycle and euthanized , or mated , injected with ( 3)H-TdR , and euthanized at various days post-coitus .	
20964820_s5	Sections were stained for estrogen receptor-Î±(ER-Î±) or progesterone receptor ( PR ) via immunohistochemistry .	
20964820_s6	Cells labelled with both 5-BrdU and ( 3)H-TdR were indicative of label-retaining epithelial cells ( LREC ) .	
20964820_s7	RESULTS Cells that retained a 5-BrdU label and cells labelled with [ (3)H]-thymidine were found in all mice and were typically detected along the branching epithelium of mature mouse mammary glands .	
20964820_s8	Cells containing double-labelled nuclei ( LREC ) were found in the intact mammary gland of both pregnant and nulliparous mice , and in mammary glands implanted with pre-malignant cells .	
20964820_s9	Double-labelled cells ( (3)H-TdR/5-BrdU ) represent a small portion of cells in the mammary gland that cycle and retain their template DNA ( 5-BrdU ) .	
20964820_s10	Some label-retaining cells were also ER-Î± or PR positive .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20964820_s11	LRECs distributed their second label ( (3)H-TdR ) to daughter cells ; and this effect persisted during pregnancy .	
20964820_s12	LRECs , and small focal hyperplasia , were found in all immortalized premalignant mammary implant groups .	
20964820_s13	CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that a subpopulation of long-lived , label-retaining epithelial cells ( LRECs ) is present in immortal premalignant cell populations .	
20964820_s14	These LRECs persist during pregnancy , retain their original DNA , and a small percentage express ER-Î± and PR .	
20964820_s15	We speculate that LRECs in premalignant hyperplasia represent the long-lived ( memory ) cells that maintain these populations indefinitely .	
20965410_s0	INTRODUCTION The insulin-like growth factor I receptor ( IGF-IR ) pathway plays a major role in cancer growth , tumor cell survival and resistance to therapy .	
20965410_s1	BACKGROUND Preclinical evidence that targeting the IGF-IR is effective in cancer treatment has been accumulating for almost 2 decades .	
20965410_s2	Early clinical trials revealed an acceptable safety profile together with pharmacodynamic evidence that the receptor can be targeted successfully .	
20965410_s3	It is premature to draw conclusions regarding the therapeutic potential of this class of compounds but well-documented single-agent activity was noted during phase I evaluations , and recent evidence from a phase-II study suggests that co-administration of an anti-IGF-1R antibody with chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) improves objective response rate and progression-free survival .	
20965410_s4	VIEWPOINTS These early results are a strong indication for continued research on the targeting of IGF-R , particularly in the treatment of NSCLC .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20965410_s5	CONCLUSIONS Today , IGF-1R targeting appears a promising approach , more than two dozen compounds have been developed and clinical trials are underway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20975318_s0	BACKGROUND/AIMS We investigated whether the anticancer drug Ukrain ( UK ) is able to modulate the expression of some of the key markers of tumor progression in pancreatic cell carcinoma , in order to assess its potential therapeutic effect .	
20975318_s1	METHODS Three cell lines ( HPAF-II , PL45 , HPAC ) were treated with UK ( 5 , 10 and 20 Î¼M ) for 48 h , or left untreated .	
20975318_s2	Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine ( SPARC ) mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR .	
20975318_s3	Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP)-2 and -9 activity was analyzed by SDS zymography ; SPARC protein levels in cell lysates and supernatants were determined by Western blot .	
20975318_s4	Cell cycle was determined by flow cytometric analysis , and invasion by matrigel invasion assay .	
20975318_s5	RESULTS UK down-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 , suggesting that UK may decrease pancreatic cancer cell invasion , as confirmed by the matrigel invasion assay .	activating invasion and metastasis
20975318_s6	SPARC protein down-regulation in supernatants points to an inhibition by UK of extracellular matrix remodeling in the tumor microenvironment .	
20975318_s7	At the same time , SPARC mRNA and cellular protein level up-regulation suggests that UK can affect cell proliferation by cell cycle inhibition , showing a cell cycle G2/M arrest in UK-treated cells .	evading growth suppressors
20975318_s8	CONCLUSION Our results suggest that UK modulates two major aspects involved in tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer cells , such as extracellular matrix remodeling and cell proliferation .	
20975834_s0	PTEN , a phosphoinositide-3-phosphatase , serves dual roles as a tumor suppressor and regulator of cellular anabolic/catabolic metabolism .	
20975834_s1	Adaptation of a redox-sensitive cysteinyl thiol in PTEN for signal transduction by hydrogen peroxide may have superimposed a vulnerability to other mediators of oxidative stress and inflammation , especially reactive carbonyl species , which are commonly occurring by-products of arachidonic acid peroxidation .	
20975834_s2	Using MCF7 and HEK-293 cells , we report that several reactive aldehydes and ketones , e.g. electrophilic Î±,Î²-enals ( acrolein , 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal ) and Î±,Î²-enones ( prostaglandin A(2) , Î12-prostaglandin J(2) and 15-deoxy-Î-12,14-prostaglandin J(2) ) covalently modify and inactivate cellular PTEN , with ensuing activation of PKB/Akt kinase ; phosphorylation of Akt substrates ; increased cell proliferation ; and increased nuclear Î²-catenin signaling .	
20975834_s3	Alkylation of PTEN by Î±,Î²-enals/enones and interference with its restraint of cellular PKB/Akt signaling may accentuate hyperplastic and neoplastic disorders associated with chronic inflammation , oxidative stress , or aging .	tumor promoting inflammation
20980434_s0	p38 kinases activated by growth factors , hormones , and environmental stresses exert diverse functions in regulating normal and malignant cell pathophysiology .	
20980434_s1	Enhanced levels of activated p38 isoforms have been linked with poor prognosis in breast cancer , although the mechanistic basis for this association is poorly understood .	
20980434_s2	In this study , we report that p38 activation in cervical cancer cells is driven by osteopontin ( OPN ) , an extracellular matrix-associated cytokine that drives invasive progression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20980434_s3	OPN regulates CD44-mediated p38 phosphorylation that induces NF-ÎºB activation and NF-ÎºB-dependent expression of furin , an extracellular protease implicated in human papilloma virus ( HPV ) processing that enhances cervical cancer cell motility .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20980434_s4	OPN induces CD44-mediated MKK3/6 phosphorylation which in turn phosphorylates p38 in these cells .	
20980434_s5	OPN-induced furin expression and cell motility was impeded by blockades to MKK3/6 , p38Î±/Î² or NF-ÎºB signaling .	
20980434_s6	In a mouse xenograft model of human cervical cancer , tumor growth was enhanced by OPN overexpression and blocked by short hairpin RNA ( shRNA)-mediated OPN silencing .	
20980434_s7	Furin overexpression similarly augmented tumor growth in the model , whereas blocking MKK3/6 , p38 , or furin reduced OPN-induced cervical tumor growth .	
20980434_s8	Analysis of clinical specimens revealed that enhanced expression of OPN , phosphorylated NF-ÎºB , p65 , and furin correlated with cervical cancer progression , further strengthening the in vitro and in vivo results .	
20980434_s9	In summary , our findings offer a proof of concept for targeting OPN and its downstream p38 signaling as a novel therapeutic strategy to manage cervical cancer .	
20980775_s0	BACKGROUND Though an increased efficacy of carmustine and temozolomide ( TMZ ) has been demonstrated by inactivation of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) with O(6)-benzyl-guanine ( BG ) in human pancreatic tumors refractive to alkylating agents , the regulatory mechanisms have not been explored .	
20980775_s1	METHODS The effects of TMZ and BG on apoptosis , cell growth , the mitotic index , cell cycle distribution , and protein expression were studied by TUNEL , cell counting , flow cytometry , and Western blot analysis , respectively .	
20980775_s2	RESULTS The wt-p53 human pancreatic tumor cell line Capan-2 and p53-efficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were more responsive to treatment with TMZ + BG than mutant p53 Capan-1 and p53-null MEFs .	
20980775_s3	S phase delay with a subsequent G2/M arrest was observed in Capans in response to BG + TMZ .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
20980775_s4	The G1-to-S transition delay in Capan-2 was associated with p53-dependent apoptosis and was distinctly different from the presumed mismatch repair ( MMR ) killing operative during the G2/M arrest .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
20980775_s5	The effect of p53 on BG + TMZ toxicity was supported by a marked change in apoptosis when p53 function was restored/inactivated .	
20980775_s6	There was an early induction of MMR proteins in p53-efficient lines .	
20980775_s7	CONCLUSION p53 provokes a classic proapoptotic response by delaying G1-to-S progression , but it may also facilitate cell killing by enhancing MMR-related cell cycle arrest and cell death .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
21035309_s0	OBJECTIVE Chronic generation of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species are implicated in atherosclerosis , aging , cancers , and other chronic diseases .	
21035309_s1	We hypothesized that zinc induces A20 in premonocytic , endothelial , and cancer cells , and A20 binds to tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-receptor associated factor , and inhibits IÎº kinase-Î± ( IKK-Î±)/nuclear factor-ÎºB ( NF-ÎºB ) , resulting in downregulation of TNF-Î± and interleukin-1Î² ( IL-1Î² ) .	
21035309_s2	METHODS To test this hypothesis , we used HL-60 , human umbilical vein endothelial cells , and SW480 cell lines under zinc-deficient and zinc-sufficient conditions in this study .	
21035309_s3	We measured oxidative stress markers , inflammatory cytokines , A20 protein and mRNA , A20-FRAF-1 complex , and IKK-Î±/NF-ÎºB signaling in stimulated zinc-deficient and zinc sufficient cells .	
21035309_s4	We also conducted antisense A20 and siRNA studies to investigate the regulatory role of zinc in TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² via A20 .	
21035309_s5	RESULTS We found that zinc increased A20 and A20-tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated factor-1 complex , decreased the IKK-Î±/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway , oxidative stress markers , and inflammatory cytokines in these cells compared with zinc-deficient cells .	tumor promoting inflammation
21035309_s6	We confirmed that zinc-induced A20 contributes to downregulation of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² by antisense and short interfering RNA A20 studies .	
21035309_s7	CONCLUSION Our studies suggest that zinc suppresses generation of NF-ÎºB-regulated inflammatory cytokines by induction of A20 .	tumor promoting inflammation
21040752_s0	Several studies have indicated that the cell-surface expressed nucleolin is implicated in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis , and represents an important target for cancer therapy .	
21040752_s1	Here we show that treatment of rhabdoid tumor derived G401 cells with a nucleolin antagonist , the HB-19 pseudopeptide , could restore contact inhibition , impair anchorage-independent growth , and suppress tumor development in nude mice .	evading growth suppressors
21040752_s2	G401 cells grow without contact inhibition , which is an in vitro characteristic property of malignant tumor cells .	
21040752_s3	At concentrations of HB-19 that does not affect cell viability and multiplication index , there is restoration of contact inhibition thus suggesting that HB-19 treatment causes reversion of the malignant phenotype .	evading growth suppressors
21040752_s4	Accordingly , HB-19 pretreated G401 cells lose the capacity to form colonies in soft agar .	
21040752_s5	When assayed for tumorigenicity in nude mice , only 50% of mice injected with HB-19 pretreated G401 cells developed tumors with the mean tumor weight of 0.32 g , compared to 100% of mice injected with control G401 cells with the mean tumor weight of 2.36 g .	
21040752_s6	Interestingly , the restoration of contact inhibition in HB-19 treated G401 cells is concomitant with marked reduction of transcripts coding the Wilms ' tumor 1 gene , matrix metalloproteinase-2 , epithelial isoform of CD44 , and vascular endothelial growth factor , whereas no apparent modification is detected for transcripts coding the proto-oncogene c-Myc , anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 , pro-apoptotic Bax , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP-1 , angiogenesis inhibitor TSP-1 , and growth factor Midkine .	
21040752_s7	These findings indicate that the molecular mechanism of action of HB-19 on such highly malignant rhabdoid tumor cells is associated with a selective inhibitory effect on the expression of genes implicated in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis .	
21042532_s0	Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinomas of the kidney are rare neoplasms constituting about 1-5% of all renal malignant neoplasms .	
21042532_s1	These are aggressive tumors and are commonly associated with conventional ( clear cell ) renal cell carcinomas , but cases associated with chromophobe renal cell carcinomas are sparse .	
21042532_s2	Cytological features of such lesions have rarely been reported .	
21042532_s3	Here , we report a unique case of a 48-year-old male patient who presented with right flank lump and pain .	
21042532_s4	A fine needle aspiration was performed from the lesion under ultrasound guidance and a cytological diagnosis of pleomorphic sarcoma was made .	
21042532_s5	A right-sided radical nephrectomy was carried out and subsequent histopathology revealed a sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma with wide areas of necrosis coexisting with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma with calcification .	resisting cell death
21042532_s6	Differentiation of pleomorphic sarcoma from a sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma is , thus , challenging from cytopathology smears and the differential diagnoses should always be borne in mind while giving a cytopathological opinion .	
21045259_s0	Cancer development is associated with genetic instability .	
21045259_s1	Identification of specific loci altered during carcinogenesis in a particular tissue gives scope for early detection and predicting the progressive nature of the tissue pathology .	
21045259_s2	Instability at microsatellite loci is widely attributed to mismatch repair errors due to epigenetic alterations .	
21045259_s3	Using three dinucleotide markers , D3S1313 , D9S171 , D17S250 and two mononucleotide markers BAT25 , BATRII , we evaluated MSI in 97 cases enrolled for endoscopy of upper GI tract with symptoms of dyspepsia , reflux or dysphagia .	
21045259_s4	We aimed at evaluating markers that reflect instability in esophageal malignancies , examine the prevalence of MSI in cancers and other pathologies of the esophagus , and determine the methylation status of hMLH1 gene in relation to MSI. 42% ( 21/50 ) cancers and 15.4%(2/13) precancers exhibited MSI where 85.7% cancers and 50% precancers with MSI , showed a hypermethylated hMLH1 promoter .	
21045259_s5	Increased number of cases with repair gene methylation were seen with increasing severity of the esophageal pathology suggesting epigenetic progression parallels histologic changes .	genomic instability and mutation
21045259_s6	BAT25 and D3S1313 markers exhibited instability frequently and cases with MSI using these markers showed an abnormal hMLH1 promoter .	
21045259_s7	Thus these markers were useful in identifying the mismatch repair phenotype .	genomic instability and mutation
21045259_s8	These two markers may be useful to screen cases for early cancer related changes , after validation on a larger sample .	
21049082_s0	Many cells in mammals exist in the state of quiescence , which is characterized by reversible exit from the cell cycle .	
21049082_s1	Quiescent cells are widely reported to exhibit reduced size , nucleotide synthesis , and metabolic activity .	
21049082_s2	Much lower glycolytic rates have been reported in quiescent compared with proliferating lymphocytes .	
21049082_s3	In contrast , we show here that primary human fibroblasts continue to exhibit high metabolic rates when induced into quiescence via contact inhibition .	cellular energetics,evading growth suppressors
21049082_s4	By monitoring isotope labeling through metabolic pathways and quantitatively identifying fluxes from the data , we show that contact-inhibited fibroblasts utilize glucose in all branches of central carbon metabolism at rates similar to those of proliferating cells , with greater overflow flux from the pentose phosphate pathway back to glycolysis .	cellular energetics
21049082_s5	Inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway resulted in apoptosis preferentially in quiescent fibroblasts .	
21049082_s6	By feeding the cells labeled glutamine , we also detected a " backwards " flux in the tricarboxylic acid cycle from Î±-ketoglutarate to citrate that was enhanced in contact-inhibited fibroblasts ; this flux likely contributes to shuttling of NADPH from the mitochondrion to cytosol for redox defense or fatty acid synthesis .	
21049082_s7	The high metabolic activity of the fibroblasts was directed in part toward breakdown and resynthesis of protein and lipid , and in part toward excretion of extracellular matrix proteins .	cellular energetics
21049082_s8	Thus , reduced metabolic activity is not a hallmark of the quiescent state .	cellular energetics
21049082_s9	Quiescent fibroblasts , relieved of the biosynthetic requirements associated with generating progeny , direct their metabolic activity to preservation of self integrity and alternative functions beneficial to the organism as a whole .	
21057538_s0	The vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib has been approved for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic renal cancer and is currently being trialled in other cancers .	
21057538_s1	However , the effectiveness of this anti-angiogenic agent is limited by the presence of innate and acquired drug resistance .	
21057538_s2	By screening a panel of candidate growth factors we identified fibroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2 ) as a potent regulator of endothelial cell sensitivity to sunitinib .	
21057538_s3	We show that FGF2 supports endothelial proliferation and de novo tubule formation in the presence of sunitinib and that FGF2 can suppress sunitinib-induced retraction of tubules .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21057538_s4	Importantly , these effects of FGF2 were ablated by PD173074 , a small molecule inhibitor of FGF receptor signalling .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21057538_s5	We also show that FGF2 can stimulate pro-angiogenic signalling pathways in endothelial cells despite the presence of sunitinib .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21057538_s6	Finally , analysis of clinical renal-cancer samples demonstrates that a large proportion of renal cancers strongly express FGF2 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21057538_s7	We suggest that therapeutic strategies designed to simultaneously target both VEGF and FGF2 signalling may prove more efficacious than sunitinib in renal cancer patients whose tumours express FGF2 .	
21058192_s0	Numerous scientific studies have examined the relationship between coffee consumption and an array of medical conditions , including cancer , and yet the direct effect of commercially brewed coffee on cancer cells has not been evaluated .	
21058192_s1	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiproliferation effect of 4 different regular and decaffeinated coffee brews and 3 of coffee's bioactive ingredients-caffeine , chlorogenic acids , and caffeic acid-on 2 human ovarian cancer cell lines alone and in combination with cisplatin ( CDDP ) .	
21058192_s2	Antiproliferation IC(50) for Brand A regular and decaffeinated coffee on A2780 cells was 1:70.79 Â± 5.66 and 1:55.68 Â± 2.00 dilution ( vol/vol ) in tissue culture medium ( mean Â± standard error of the mean ; N = 12 ) , respectively , and slightly lower on A2780CP70 cells .	
21058192_s3	Three other brands showed lower antiproliferation activity .	
21058192_s4	Antiproliferation IC(50) concentrations of chlorogenic acids and caffeic acid are many folds lower than caffeine .	
21058192_s5	In combination with CDDP , both Brand A coffee brews , and the 3 bioactive compounds , showed additive antiproliferation effect on both cancer cell lines .	
21058192_s6	Flow cytometry analysis showed that coffee treatment induced apoptosis of A2780 and A2780CP70 cells .	resisting cell death
21058192_s7	To our knowledge , this is the first report showing the antiproliferation activity and the additive effect with CDDP of commercially prepared coffee brews on human cancer cell lines .	
21061467_s0	Cell division and apoptosis are two crucial components of tumor biology and the importance of increased cell proliferation and reduced cell death have made them valid therapeutic targets .	
21061467_s1	The plant kingdom is a relatively underexploited cache of novel drugs , and crude extracts of plants are known for their synergistic activity .	
21061467_s2	The present study assessed the anti-proliferative activity of the medicinal plant Centrosema pubescens Benth .	
21061467_s3	Centrosema pubescens dichloromethane extract ( CPDE ) inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 ( promyelocytic acute leukaemia ) cells with an ICââ value of 5 Î¼g/ml .	
21061467_s4	Further studies also showed that CPDE induces growth arrest at the G1 phase and specifically down-regulates the expressions of cyclin E and CDK2 and up-regulates p27(CKI) levels .	evading growth suppressors
21061467_s5	These events apparently lead to the induction of apoptosis , which was demonstrated qualitatively by a DNA fragmentation assay and propidium iodide staining .	resisting cell death
21061467_s6	Quantitative assessment of the effective arrest of the cell cycle and of apoptosis was confirmed by flow cytometry .	
21061467_s7	CPDE exhibited negligible cytotoxicity even at the highest dose tested ( 100 Î¼g/ml ) in both normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in an in vitro model ( HL-60 ) .	
21061467_s8	Our results strongly suggest that CPDE arrests the cell cycle at the G1 phase and triggers apoptosis by caspase activation .	
21062926_s0	PURPOSE Steroid hormones and growth factors affect lung cancer , and it is possible they act in concert to influence patient outcome .	
21062926_s1	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Primary lung tumors and normal lung tissue were analyzed for expression and localization of estrogen receptor Î± and Î²-1 ( ERÎ± and ERÎ² ) , aromatase , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) .	
21062926_s2	RESULTS Tumors expressed higher levels of ERÎ² compared to matched normal lung , whereas the reverse was true of PR .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21062926_s3	High cytoplasmic ERÎ² expression was identified as an independent negative prognostic predictor of overall survival ( OS ; HR = 1.67 ) , and low total PR was identified as an independent negative predictor of time to progression ( TTP ; HR = 1.59 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21062926_s4	After adjusting for stage , age , sex , and smoking , combined high cytoplasmic ERÎ² and low total PR showed enhanced effects on OS ( HR = 2.64 ) and on TTP ( HR = 6.02 ) .	
21062926_s5	Further effects on OS were observed when EGFR expression was included ( HR = 5.32 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21062926_s6	Patients with low cytoplasmic ERÎ² , low aromatase , low EGFR , and high total PR had shorter OS than patients with the opposite pattern ( HR = 6.60 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21062926_s7	Contribution of these markers to survival showed no significant sex differences in a multivariable model .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21062926_s8	ERÎ± was elevated in tumors but was not predictive of survival , and appears to represent a variant ERÎ± protein that is only recognized by a C-terminal antibody .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21062926_s9	CONCLUSIONS Hormonal and EGFR pathways together may contribute to lung cancer prognosis .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21062926_s10	Lung tumors with high ERÎ²-1/low PR may define patients with aggressive biology .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21062926_s11	A validation study is necessary to fully assess the predictive value of these markers .	
21062974_s0	Although the p16(INK4a) and p21Waf1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitors are known to play key roles in cellular senescence in vitro , their roles in senescence remain rather poorly understood in vivo .	
21062974_s1	This situation is partly due to the possibility of compensatory effect(s) between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 or to the upregulation of functionally related CDK inhibitors .	
21062974_s2	To directly address the cooperative roles of p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in senescence in vivo , we generated a mouse line simply lacking both p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 genes [ double-knockout ( DKO) ] .	
21062974_s3	Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEF ) derived from DKO mice displayed no evidence of cellular senescence when cultured serially in vitro .	enabling replicative immortality
21062974_s4	Moreover , DKO MEFs readily escaped Ras-induced senescence and overrode contact inhibition in culture .	evading growth suppressors
21062974_s5	This was not the case in MEFs lacking either p16INK4a or p21Waf1/Cip1 , indicating that p16(INK4a) and p21Waf1/Cip1 play cooperative roles in cellular senescence and contact inhibition in vitro .	enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors
21062974_s6	Notably , we found the DKO mice to be extremely susceptible to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced skin carcinogenesis that involves oncogenic mutation of the H-ras gene .	genomic instability and mutation
21062974_s7	Mechanistic investigations suggested that the high incidence of cancer in DKO mice likely reflected a cooperative effect of increased benign skin tumor formation caused by p21Waf1/Cip1 loss , with increased malignant conversion of benign skin tumors caused by p16(INK4a) loss .	evading growth suppressors
21062974_s8	Our findings establish an intrinsic cooperation between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in the onset of cellular senescence and tumor suppression in vivo .	enabling replicative immortality
21063097_s0	Genotoxic stress induces cell cycle arrest and DNA repair which may enable tumor cells to survive radiation therapy .	
21063097_s1	Here , we defined the role of Ca(2+) signaling in the cell cycle control and survival of chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) cells subjected to ionizing radiation ( IR ) .	
21063097_s2	To this end , K562 erythroid leukemia cells were irradiated ( 0-10 Gy ) .	
21063097_s3	Tumor survival was analyzed by clonogenic survival assay and cell cycle progression via flow cytometry .	
21063097_s4	Plasma membrane cation conductance was assessed by patch-clamp whole-cell recording and the cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ( [ Ca(2+)](i) ) was measured by fura-2 Ca(2+) imaging .	
21063097_s5	Nuclear activity of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II ( CaMKII ) was defined by Western blotting .	
21063097_s6	In addition , the effect of IR ( 5 Gy ) on the cation conductance of primary CML cells was determined .	
21063097_s7	The results indicated that IR ( 10 Gy ) induced a G(2)/M cell cycle arrest of K562 cells within 24 h post-irradiation ( p.i. ) and decreased the clonogenic survival to 0.5 % of that of the control cells .	evading growth suppressors
21063097_s8	In K562 cells , G(2)/M cell cycle arrest was preceded by activation of TRPV5/6-like nonselective cation channels in the plasma membrane 1-5 h p.i. , resulting in an elevated Ca(2+) entry as evident from fura-2 Ca(2+) imaging .	evading growth suppressors
21063097_s9	Similarly , IR stimulated a Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation conductance in primary CML cells within 2-4 h p.i. .	
21063097_s10	Ca(2+) entry , into K562 cells was paralleled by an IR-induced activation of nuclear CaMKII .	
21063097_s11	The IR-stimulated accumulation in G(2) phase was delayed upon buffering [ Ca(2+)](i) with the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM or inhibiting CaMKII with KN93 ( 1 nM ) .	
21063097_s12	In addition , KN93 decreased the clonogenic survival of irradiated cells but not of control cells .	
21063097_s13	In conclusion , the data suggest that IR-stimulated cation channel activation , Ca(2+) entry and CaMKII activity participate in control of cell cycle progression and survival of irradiated CML cells .	
21063098_s0	Periplocin is one of cardenolides isolated from cortex periplocae which is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and reinforcement of bones and tendons in traditional medicine .	
21063098_s1	Here , we investigated the anti-tumor activity of periplocin against lung cancer cells bothin vitro and in vivo , and explored its anti-cancer mechanism .	
21063098_s2	Periplocin inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells and induced their apoptosis in time- and dose-dependent manners by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
21063098_s3	Periplocin exhibited anti-tumor activity both in human ( A549 ) and mouse ( LL/2 ) lung cancer xenograft models .	
21063098_s4	Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that intratumoral angiogenesis was significantly suppressed .	inducing angiogenesis
21063098_s5	Furthermore , anti-cancer activity mediated by periplocin was associated with decreased level of phosphorylated AKT and ERK both in vitro and in vivo , which were important for cell growth and survival .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21063098_s6	Moreover , periplocin induced apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax , leading to activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 .	resisting cell death
21063098_s7	These findings suggested that periplocin could inhibit the growth of lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo , which could be attributed to the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis signaling pathway , such as AKT and ERK .	
21063098_s8	These observations provide further evidence on the anti-tumor effect of periplocin , and it may be of importance to further explore its potential role as a therapeutic agent for cancer .	
21069451_s0	Landmark studies of the status of DNA damage checkpoints and associated repair functions in preneoplastic and neoplastic cells has focused attention on importance of these pathways in cancer development , and inhibitors of repair pathways are in clinical trials for treatment of triple negative breast cancer .	
21069451_s1	Cancer heterogeneity suggests that specific cancer subtypes will have distinct mechanisms of DNA damage survival , dependent on biological context .	
21069451_s2	In this study , status of DNA damage response ( DDR)-associated proteins was examined in breast cancer subtypes in association with clinical features ; 479 breast cancers were examined for expression of DDR proteins Î³H2AX , BRCA1 , pChk2 , and p53 , DNA damage-sensitive tumor suppressors Fhit and Wwox , and Wwox-interacting proteins Ap2Î± , Ap2Î³ , ErbB4 , and correlations among proteins , tumor subtypes , and clinical features were assessed .	
21069451_s3	In a multivariable model , triple negative cancers showed significantly reduced Fhit and Wwox , increased p53 and Ap2Î³ protein expression , and were significantly more likely than other subtype tumors to exhibit aberrant expression of two or more DDR-associated proteins .	
21069451_s4	Disease-free survival was associated with subtype , Fhit and membrane ErbB4 expression level and aberrant expression of multiple DDR-associated proteins .	
21069451_s5	These results suggest that definition of specific DNA repair and checkpoint defects in subgroups of triple negative cancer might identify new treatment targets .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
21069451_s6	Expression of Wwox and its interactor , ErbB4 , was highly significantly reduced in metastatic tissues vs. matched primary tissues , suggesting that Wwox signal pathway loss contributes to lymph node metastasis , perhaps by allowing survival of tumor cells that have detached from basement membranes , as proposed for the role of Wwox in ovarian cancer spread .	activating invasion and metastasis
21074696_s0	Rhabdoid tumors have been reported in many different anatomic sites as an aggressive tumor and usually present with a rhabdoid tumor component ( a composite tumor ) rather than a pure rhabdoid tumor .	
21074696_s1	Rhabdoid tumor in the prostate has been described only once in the prostatic region as a possible epithelial origin .	
21074696_s2	Rhabdoid features in prostatic stromal sarcomas ( PSSs ) have never been described in the literature .	
21074696_s3	Here , we report a case of a PSS with rhabdoid features .	
21074696_s4	A 31-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of voiding difficulty and anal pain .	
21074696_s5	Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an ovoid mass in the prostate invading rectum and urinary bladder .	
21074696_s6	A needle biopsy was diagnosed as an unclassified spindle cell sarcoma , and 2 cycles of adriamycin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy were given , followed by radical prostatectomy .	
21074696_s7	The prostatectomy specimen revealed a high-grade sarcoma with fascicles of highly cellular spindle cells and numerous mitoses with hemorrhage and necrosis .	resisting cell death
21074696_s8	In areas , the tumor also contained sheets of loosely cohesive epithelioid cells with rhabdoid tumor component .	
21074696_s9	Both spindle and rhabdoid tumor cells were positive for vimentin , CD34 , and progesterone receptor and negative for desmin and cytokeratin immunostainings .	
21074696_s10	The rhabdoid tumor cells retained INI1 expression .	
21074696_s11	The tumor recurred in the bladder , and the patient died of sepsis .	
21074696_s12	To the best of our knowledge , this is the first case of PSS with rhabdoid features .	
21074696_s13	The tumor showed an aggressive clinical behavior with a short-term survival ( 7 months after diagnosis ) .	
21075102_s0	HGF signaling induces epithelial cells to disassemble cadherin-based adhesion and increase cell motility and invasion , a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) .	
21075102_s1	EMT plays a major role in cancer metastasis , allowing individual cells to detach from the primary tumor , invade local tissue , and colonize distant tissues with new tumors .	
21075102_s2	While invasion of vascular and lymphatic networks is the predominant route of metastasis , nerves also can act as networks for dissemination of cancer cell to distant sites in a process termed perineual invasion ( PNI ) .	
21075102_s3	Signaling between nerves and invasive cancer cells remains poorly understood , as does cellular decision making that selects the specific route of invasion .	
21075102_s4	Here we examine how HGF signaling contributes to PNI using reductionist culture model systems .	
21075102_s5	We find that TGFÎ² , produced by PC12 cells , enhances scattering in response to HGF stimulation , increasing both cell-cell junction disassembly and cell migration .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21075102_s6	Further , gradients of TGFÎ² induce migratory mesenchymal cells to undergo chemotaxis towards the source of TGFÎ² .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
21075102_s7	Interestingly , VEGF suppresses TGFÎ²-induced enhancement of scattering .	
21075102_s8	These results have broad implications for how combinatorial growth factor signaling contributes to cancer metastasis , suggesting that VEGF and TGFÎ² might modulate HGF signaling to influence route selection during cancer progression .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
21076414_s0	Metastatic cancer cells typically fail to halt migration on contact with non-cancer cells .	
21076414_s1	This invasiveness is in contrast to normal mesenchymal cells that retract on contact with another cell .	
21076414_s2	Why cancer cells are defective in contact inhibition of locomotion is not understood .	
21076414_s3	Here , we analyse the dynamics of prostate cancer cell lines co-cultured with fibroblasts , and demonstrate that a combinatorial code of Eph receptor activation dictates whether cell migration will be contact inhibited .	evading growth suppressors
21076414_s4	The unimpeded migration of metastatic PC-3 cells towards fibroblasts is dependent on activation of EphB3 and EphB4 by ephrin-B2 , which we show activates Cdc42 and cell migration .	activating invasion and metastasis
21076414_s5	Knockdown of EphB3 and EphB4 restores contact inhibition of locomotion to PC-3 cells .	evading growth suppressors
21076414_s6	Conversely , homotypic collisions between two cancer cells results in contact inhibition of locomotion , mediated by EphA-Rho-Rho kinase ( ROCK ) signalling .	evading growth suppressors
21076414_s7	Thus , the migration of cancer cells can switch from restrained to invasive , depending on the Eph-receptor profile of the cancer cell and the reciprocal ephrin ligands expressed by neighbouring cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
21082277_s0	An epithelial cell line , referred to as A163 , was established from breast carcinoma derived from a patient with a strong family history of breast cancer but no known breast cancer susceptibility mutation .	
21082277_s1	A163 was propagated in a serum-free culture medium including the epidermal growth factor .	
21082277_s2	Immunophenotypic characterization demonstrated a mixed luminal and basal-like phenotype .	
21082277_s3	When epidermal growth factor was excluded from the culture medium , A163 entered a quiescent period followed by a period of increased cell proliferation in a subpopulation of the cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21082277_s4	The epidermal growth factor-independent subpopulation retained the basal-like phenotype of the parental cell line .	
21082277_s5	Karyotype and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis showed an amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor on 7q in A163-S1 only , resulting in high expression of total and phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21082277_s6	The A163-S1 sub-line piles up in culture , indicating a loss of contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
21082277_s7	When grown on transwell filters , A163 shows basal expression of P63 and cytokeratin 14 , whereas A163-S1 expresses P63 ubiquitously , and has lost the basal specific expression of cytokeratin 14 , indicating a loss of polarity .	
21082277_s8	Furthermore , when cultured in reconstituted basement membrane matrix , A163 form polarized normal like acini .	
21082277_s9	In contrast , A163-S1 form large disorganized structures with lack of polarity .	
21082277_s10	These cell lines may prove useful to understand molecular changes in breast cancer progression , in particular basal-like breast cancer subtype with bad prognosis and no current treatment options .	
21087507_s0	BACKGROUND Adult human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSC ) have been shown to home to sites of carcinoma and affect biological processes , including tumour growth and metastasis .	
21087507_s1	Previous findings have been conflicting and a clear understanding of the effects of hMSCs on cancer remains to be established .	
21087507_s2	Therefore , we set out to investigate the impact of hMSCs on the oestrogen receptor positive , hormone-dependent breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 .	
21087507_s3	RESULTS In this study , we show the effects of hMSCs on cancer cells are mediated through a secreted factor(s) which are enhanced by cancer cell-hMSC contact/communication .	
21087507_s4	In addition to enhanced proliferation when in co-culture with hMSCs , MCF-7 cells were found to have increased migration potential in vitro .	activating invasion and metastasis
21087507_s5	Inhibition of ER signalling by the pure anti-oestrogen ICI 182,780 decreased the effect of hMSCs on MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration supporting a role for ER signalling in the hMSC/MCF-7 cell interaction .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21087507_s6	Additionally , hMSCs have been shown to secrete a wide variety of growth factors and chemokines including stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21087507_s7	This coupled with the knowledge that SDF-1 is an ER-mediated gene linked with hormone-independence and metastasis led to the investigation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signalling axis in hMSC-MCF-7 cell interaction .	
21087507_s8	Experiments revealed an increase in SDF-1 gene expression both in vivo and in vitro when MCF-7 cells were cultured with hMSCs .	
21087507_s9	SDF-1 treatment of MCF-7 cells alone increased proliferation to just below that seen with hMSC co-culture .	
21087507_s10	Additionally , blocking SDF-1 signalling using a CXCR4-specific inhibitor decreased hMSC induced proliferation and migration of MCF-7 .	
21087507_s11	However , the combined treatment of ICI and AMD3100 reduced MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration below control levels , indicating targeting both the ER and CXCR4 pathways is effective in decreasing the hMSCs induction of MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21087507_s12	CONCLUSIONS The sum of these data reveals the relationship between tumour microenvironment and tumour growth and progression .	
21087507_s13	Better understanding of the mechanisms involved in this tumour stroma cell interaction may provide novel targets for the development of treatment strategies for oestrogen receptor positive , hormone-independent , and endocrine-resistant breast carcinoma .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21097672_s0	Multiple myeloma is characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells ( multiple myeloma cells [ MMCs] ) , in the bone marrow .	
21097672_s1	Osteolytic bone lesions are detected in 80% of patients because of increased osteoclastic bone resorption and reduced osteoblastic bone formation .	
21097672_s2	MMCs are found closely associated with sites of increased bone resorption .	
21097672_s3	Osteoclasts strongly support MMC survival in vitro .	
21097672_s4	To further elucidate the mechanisms involved in osteoclast/MMC interaction , we have identified 552 genes overexpressed in osteoclasts compared with other bone marrow cell subpopulations .	
21097672_s5	Osteoclasts express specifically genes coding for 4 CCR2-targeting chemokines and genes coding for MMC growth factors .	
21097672_s6	An anti-CCR2 monoclonal antibody blocked osteoclast chemoattractant activity for MMC , and CCR2 chemokines are also MMC growth factors , promoting mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in MMC .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21097672_s7	An anti-insulin growth factor-1 receptor monoclonal antibody completely blocked the osteoclast-induced survival of MMC suppressing both osteoclast and MMC survival .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21097672_s8	Specific a proliferation-inducing ligand or IL-6 inhibitors partially blocked osteoclast-induced MMC survival .	
21097672_s9	These data may explain why newly diagnosed patients whose MMC express high levels of CCR2 present numerous bone lesions .	
21097672_s10	This study displays additional mechanisms involved in osteoclast/MMC interaction and suggests using CCR2 and/or insulin growth factor-1 targeting strategies to block this interaction and prevent drug resistance .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21098263_s0	Many tumors contain heterogeneous populations of cells , only some of which exhibit increased tumorigenicity and resistance to anticancer therapies .	
21098263_s1	Evidence suggests that these aggressive cancer cells , often termed " cancer stem cells " or " cancer stem-like cells " ( CSCs ) , rely upon developmental signaling pathways that are important for survival and expansion of normal stem cells .	
21098263_s2	Here we report that , in analogy to embryonic mammary epithelial biology , estrogen signaling expands the pool of functional breast CSCs through a paracrine FGF/FGFR/Tbx3 signaling pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21098263_s3	Estrogen or FGF9 pretreatment induced CSC properties of breast cancer cell lines and freshly isolated breast cancer cells , whereas cotreatment of cells with tamoxifen or a small molecule inhibitor of FGFR signaling was sufficient to prevent the estrogen-induced expansion of CSCs .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21098263_s4	Furthermore , reduction of FGFR or Tbx3 gene expression was able to abrogate tumorsphere formation , whereas ectopic Tbx3 expression increased tumor seeding potential by 100-fold .	
21098263_s5	These findings demonstrate that breast CSCs are stimulated by estrogen through a signaling pathway that similarly controls normal mammary epithelial stem cell biology .	
21098705_s0	Osteoblastic bone metastases are the most common metastases produced by human prostate cancers ( PCa ) .	
21098705_s1	Deregulated activity of Wnt growth factors resulting from overexpression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 ( DKK-1 ) is known to contribute to formation of the osteoblastic component of PCa skeletal bone metastases .	
21098705_s2	In this study , we report that DKK-1 knockdown in osteolytic human PCa cells unexpectedly delays the development of both soft tissue and osseous lesions .	
21098705_s3	PCa cells deficient in DKK-1 expression did not increase canonical Wnt signaling in target osteoblast cell lines ; however , DKK-1 knockdown PCa cells exhibited increased expression of the CDK inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) and a 32% increase in G(1) arrest compared with control cells .	evading growth suppressors
21098705_s4	Ablating p21(CIP1/WAF1) in PCa cells deficient in DKK-1 was sufficient to rescue tumor growth .	
21098705_s5	Collectively , our findings demonstrate that DKK-1 overexpression supports tumor growth in part by restricting expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) through a mechanism independent of canonical Wnt signaling .	evading growth suppressors
21112394_s0	It has been demonstrated that growth factors produced by breast cancer cells stimulate aromatase expression in both breast cancer and adjacent adipose fibroblasts and stromal cells .	
21112394_s1	However , whether these growth factors affect aromatase activity by other mechanisms still remain unclear .	
21112394_s2	In the current study , MCF-7aro and T47Daro aromatase transfected breast carcinoma cells were used to explore the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of aromatase activity by growth factor pathways .	
21112394_s3	Our study reveals that PI3K/Akt and MAPK inhibitors suppressed aromatase activity in MCF-7aro cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21112394_s4	However , PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors stimulated aromatase activity in T47Daro cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21112394_s5	This is due to enhanced MAPK phosphorylation as compensation after the PI3K/Akt pathway has been blocked .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21112394_s6	IGF-1 treatment increased aromatase activity in both breast cancer cell lines .	
21112394_s7	In addition , LTEDaro cells ( long-term estrogen deprived MCF-7aro cells ) which have enhanced MAPK activity , show higher aromatase activity compared to parental MCF-7aro cells , but the aromatase protein level remains the same .	
21112394_s8	These results suggest that aromatase activity could be enhanced by growth factor signaling pathways via post-transcriptional mechanisms .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21112773_s0	Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) remains a common malignant cancer worldwide .	
21112773_s1	There is an urgent need to identify new molecular targets for the development of novel therapeutic approaches .	
21112773_s2	Herein , we review the structure , function and biology of glypican-3 ( GPC3 ) and its role in human cancer with a focus on its potential as a therapeutic target for immunotherapy .	
21112773_s3	GPC3 is a cell-surface protein that is over-expressed in HCC .	
21112773_s4	Loss-of-function mutations of GPC3 cause Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome ( SGBS ) , a rare X-linked overgrowth condition .	
21112773_s5	GPC3 binds Wnt and Hedgehog ( Hh ) signalling proteins .	
21112773_s6	GPC3 is also able to bind basic growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 through its heparan sulphate glycan chains .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21112773_s7	GPC3 is a promising candidate for liver cancer therapy given that it shows high expression in HCC .	
21112773_s8	An anti-GPC3 monoclonal antibody has shown anti-cancer activity in mice and its humanised IgG molecule is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in patients with HCC .	
21112773_s9	There is also evidence that soluble GPC3 may be a useful serum biomarker for HCC .	
21116096_s0	A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of DNA repair after exposure to ionizing radiation represents a research priority aimed at improving the outcome of clinical radiotherapy .	
21116096_s1	Because of the close association with DNA double strand break ( DSB ) repair , phosphorylation of the histone H2AX protein ( Î³H2AX ) , quantified by immunodetection , has recently been used as a method to study DSB induction and repair at low and clinically relevant radiation doses .	
21116096_s2	However , the lack of consistency in literature points to the need to further validate the role of H2AX phosphorylation in DSB repair and the use of this technique to determine intrinsic radiosensitivity .	
21116096_s3	In the present study we used human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells , characterized by a radiosensitive phenotype due to reduced levels of the Ku70 and Ku80 repair proteins , and investigated whether this repair-deficient cell line displays differences in the phosphorylation pattern of H2AX protein compared to repair-proficient MCF10A cells .	genomic instability and mutation
21116096_s4	This was established by measuring formation and disappearance of Î³H2AX foci after irradiating synchronized cell populations with ( 60)Co Î³-rays .	
21116096_s5	Our results show statistically significant differences in the number of Î³H2AX foci between the repair-deficient and -proficient cell line , with a higher amount of Î³H2AX foci present at early times post-irradiation in the Ku-deficient cell line .	genomic instability and mutation
21116096_s6	However , the disappearance of those differences at later post-irradiation times questions the use of this assay to determine intrinsic radiosensitivity , especially in a clinical setting .	
21116849_s0	The aim of this study was to determine whether caffeine enhanced radiosensitivity of normal liver tissue in a rat radiation-induced liver disease model .	
21116849_s1	Buffalo rat McA-RH7777 hepatocellular cancer cells and BRL3A normal liver cells were irradiated , and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rates were analyzed .	
21116849_s2	A rat model of radiation-induced liver disease was established , rats were randomized into four groups : control ; caffeine alone ; irradiation ( IR ) alone ; and caffeine plus IR ( Caff + IR ) group .	
21116849_s3	Apoptosis rates in normal rat liver tissue after IR were evaluated by TUNEL staining and caspase-3 Western blot .	resisting cell death
21116849_s4	Transaminase activity was measured and histopathological examination was done after IR .	
21116849_s5	Caffeine abrogated IR-induced G2 phase arrest ( Caff + IR vs. IR : 40.9 Â± 4.0 vs. 60.7 Â± 5.5% , at 12 h after IR ) and increased apoptosis rates ( Caff + IR vs. IR : 56.1 Â± 6.8 vs. 35.5 Â± 4.0% , at 72 h after IR ) in McA-RH7777 cells , but did not affect IR-induced G2 phase arrest and apoptosis rates at any time point after IR in BRL3A cells .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
21116849_s6	Caffeine did not enhance apoptosis , transaminase activity , or histopathological injury of normal rat liver tissue at any time points after IR .	resisting cell death
21116849_s7	This study suggests that caffeine might not enhance radiosensitivity of normal liver tissue in vivo .	
21116849_s8	In an earlier study , we reported that caffeine enhanced radiosensitivity of human hepatocellular cancer in a nude mice model .	
21116849_s9	Together , these results offer feasibility of clinical application .	
21120602_s0	The role of estrogen receptor beta ( ERÎ² ) in breast cancer is unclear .	
21120602_s1	ERÎ² is considered to have a protective role in breast cancer development based on findings demonstrating that ERÎ² expression inhibits ERÎ±-mediated proliferation of breast cancer cells .	
21120602_s2	We previously demonstrated that ERÎ² causes a ligand independent G2 cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells .	
21120602_s3	To study the mechanisms of the ERÎ²-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest , we investigated its effects on the regulatory pathways responsible for the G2/M phase transition .	
21120602_s4	We found that ERÎ² inhibits CDK1 activity , which is the critical determinant of the G2/M progression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21120602_s5	CDK1 activity is modulated by both stimulatory and inhibitory factors .	
21120602_s6	Cyclin B1 is the major activator of CDK1 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21120602_s7	ERÎ² inhibited the cell cycle-dependent stimulation of cyclin B1 mRNA and protein .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21120602_s8	GADD45A and BTG2 are two major inhibitors of CDK1 , which have been implicated in breast tumor formation .	
21120602_s9	Based on these findings , we explored if the expression pattern of GADD45A and BTG2 is affected by ERÎ² .	
21120602_s10	We found that ERÎ² stimulates GADD45A and BTG2 mRNA levels .	
21120602_s11	The induction of these two genes is caused by ERÎ² binding directly to these genes and recruiting c-jun and NCOA2 .	
21120602_s12	Our findings demonstrated that unliganded ERÎ² causes a G2 cell cycle arrest by inactivating CDK1 through the repression of cyclin B1 and stimulation of GADD45A and BTG2 expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21120602_s13	These results provide evidence that drugs that stimulate the production of unliganded ERÎ² may be effective new therapies to prevent breast cancer .	
21123967_s0	We investigated the priming effect and mechanism of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in chemotherapy with low-dose Ara-C and VP-16 for acute myeloid leukemia .	
21123967_s1	We analyzed cell proliferation , apoptosis , and cell cycle in vitro using leukemia cell lines 32Dcl3 , U937 , HL-60 , and Ba/F3 .	
21123967_s2	Cell proliferation assays were performed using the Trypan Blue dye exclusion method .	
21123967_s3	For detection of apoptosis , the Annexin V-binding capacity of treated cells was examined by flow cytometry .	
21123967_s4	To evaluate the cell cycle , we used an FITC BrdU Flow kit and conducted analysis by flow cytometry .	
21123967_s5	The combination of Ara-C and VP-16 significantly enhanced the observed effects compared with those of Ara-C or VP-16 alone .	
21123967_s6	Concurrent administration of G-CSF further reduced the cell number and viability of 32Dcl3 and U937 cells , but not of HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells .	
21123967_s7	Apoptotic cells were significantly increased in number by the addition of G-CSF to 32Dcl3 and U937 cells , while G-CSF had no significant effect on HL-60 and Ba/F3 cell lines .	resisting cell death
21123967_s8	The addition of G-CSF significantly decreased the percentage of G0/G1-phase cells and significantly increased that of S-phase cells among 32Dcl3 and U937 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21123967_s9	No significant effect was observed for HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells .	
21123967_s10	An enhancement was confirmed for the combination of Ara-C , VP-16 , and G-CSF for 32Dcl3 and U937 cells but not for HL-60 and Ba/F3 cells .	
21123967_s11	It was thought that this difference was a result of different responses to G-CSF .	
21123967_s12	G-CSF potentiates Ara-C- and VP-16-induced cytotoxicities through apoptosis induction by mobilizing resting G0-G1-phase cells into S phase .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
21129360_s0	Tobacco-induced oxidative stress leads to chronic inflammation and is implicated in the development of many human epithelial cancers , including head and neck cancer .	
21129360_s1	Cigarette smoke exposure was shown to induce the expression of the ÎNp63Î± and nitric oxide synthase ( NOS)-2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells and immortalized oral keratinocytes .	
21129360_s2	The NOS2 promoter was found to contain various cognate sequences for several transcription factors including interferon regulatory factor ( IRF)-6 and p63 , which were shown in vivo binding to the NOS2 promoter in response to smoke exposure .	
21129360_s3	Small interfering ( si)-RNAs against both ÎNp63Î± and IRF6 decreased the induction of NOS2 promoter-driven reporter luciferase activity and were shown to inhibit NOS2 activity .	
21129360_s4	Furthermore , both mainstream ( MSE ) and sidestream ( SSE ) smoking extracts induced changes in expression of autophagic marker , LC3B , while siRNA against ÎNp63Î± , IRF6 and NOS2 modulated these autophagic changes .	resisting cell death
21129360_s5	Overall , these data support the notion that ÎNp63Î±/IRF6 interplay regulates NOS2 transcription , thereby underlying the autophagic-related cancer cell response to tobacco exposure .	resisting cell death
21132012_s0	Monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) to HER2 are currently used to treat breast cancer , but low clinical efficacy , along with primary and acquired resistance to therapy , commonly limit clinical applications .	
21132012_s1	We previously reported that combinations of antibodies directed at non-overlapping epitopes of HER2 are endowed with enhanced antitumor effects , probably due to accelerated receptor degradation .	
21132012_s2	Here , we extend these observations to three-dimensional mammary cell models , and compare the effects of single mAbs with the effects of antibody combinations .	
21132012_s3	Collectively , our in vitro assays and computational image analyses indicate that combining mAbs against different epitopes of HER2 better inhibits invasive growth .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
21132012_s4	Importantly , while growth factors are able to reduce intraluminal apoptosis and induce an invasive phenotype , combinations of mAbs better than single mAbs can reverse the growth factor-induced phenotypes of HER2-overexpressing spheroids .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21132012_s5	In conclusion , our studies propose that mAb combinations negate the biological effects of growth factors on invasive growth of HER2-overexpressing cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21132012_s6	Hence , combining mAbs offers a therapeutic strategy , potentially able to enhance clinical efficacy of existing antireceptor immunotherapeutics .	
21133594_s0	Construction industry workers are exposed to many known carcinogens in their complex occupational environment .	
21133594_s1	Since there are no past studies on genotoxicity among this group in the Indian subcontinent , workers engaged in different construction sites at Coimbatore , Tamil Nadu , India , were assessed here .	
21133594_s2	We enrolled 96 workers and 68 control subjects with similar mean age , smoking , tobacco chewing prevalence and alcohol consumption , for analysis of DNA damage in blood leucocytes by micronucleus ( MN ) and comet assays .	
21133594_s3	DNA repair inhibition was also analyzed by assessing the XPD gene .	
21133594_s4	Construction workers showed a significant increase in MN and comet tail length compared to controls with adjustment for smoking habits , tobacco chewing , alcohol consumption and years of exposure ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	
21133594_s5	The results indicated that chronic occupational exposure to cement during construction work could lead to increased levels of DNA damage and repair inhibition .	genomic instability and mutation
21136273_s0	PURPOSE BMP-6 , which belongs to the TGF-Î² superfamily , is a multifunctional molecule with distinct abilities in embryogenesis and organogenesis .	
21136273_s1	Our recent research has implied that BMP-6 may suppress breast cancer metastasis .	
21136273_s2	In the present study , we extended to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which BMP-6 exerts its anti-tumorigenic effect .	
21136273_s3	METHODS The Boyden chamber assay was used to examine the ability of BMP-6 and HO-1 in MCF-7 malignant progress .	
21136273_s4	RT-PCR , western blot , luciferase assay , and quantitative CHIP were used to determine the potential mechanism and signaling pathways by which BMP-6 and HO-1 function as anti-metastatic factors in MCF-7 cells .	
21136273_s5	RESULTS The Boyden chamber assay showed that BMP-6 inhibited the migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells , which effect was significantly deprived by knockdown of HO-1 .	activating invasion and metastasis
21136273_s6	We further demonstrated that BMP-6 treatment resulted in an activation of HO-1 transcription through the recruitment of Smad1/5 to the Smad-responsive element on its promoter .	
21136273_s7	In addition , BMP-6-induced up-regulation of HO-1 exhibited an inhibitory effect on MMP-9 secretion in a paracrine action in MCF-7 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
21136273_s8	Overexpression of BMP-6 and HO-1 synergistically suppressed MMP-9 transcription , which effect was specifically mediated via the MAPK/p38/AP-1 signaling .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
21136273_s9	However , blockade of HO-1 using ZnPPIX totally abolished BMP-6-regulated MMP-9 activation in MCF-7 cells .	
21136273_s10	CONCLUSIONS These observations suggest a novel role of BMP-6/HO-1 cascade to relieve breast cancer metastasis by regulating the secretion of growth factors in tumor microenvironment .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
21137066_s0	PURPOSE Germline mutations in BRCA1 result in a strong predisposition to breast cancer , with frequent loss of heterozygosity of the remaining wild-type allele .	
21137066_s1	The development of BRCA1 tumors is likely to depend on additional genetic alterations and gene expression changes which follow growth and DNA repair defects associated with BRCA1 deficiency .	
21137066_s2	The identification of these modifications offers an opportunity to find surrogate markers of BRCA1 tumors .	
21137066_s3	Here , we sought to identify differentially expressed proteins related to BRCA1 depletion .	
21137066_s4	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We used isogenic HeLa cells either stably knocked-down or not for BRCA1 ( BRCA1(KD) ) and compared protein profiles of these cells by DIGE .	
21137066_s5	RESULTS We detected increased levels of Replication protein A2 ( RPA2 ) in BRCA1(KD) cells as compared to control cells .	
21137066_s6	RPA2 is an essential protein required for DNA replication and repair .	genomic instability and mutation
21137066_s7	We further demonstrated that depletion of RPA2 subunit delays growth of BRCA1(KD) respect to isogenic control cells .	
21137066_s8	Strikingly , elevated levels of RPA2 were more frequently observed in BRCA1 tumors when triple-negative tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers ( n=13 ) and non-carriers ( n=36 ) were stained in situ for RPA2 .	
21137066_s9	CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE RPA2 up-regulation may thus be involved in the growth and/or survival of BRCA1 tumor cells and useful in immunohistochemical discrimination of triple-negative BRCA1 tumors .	
21147860_s0	BACKGROUND Epidemiologic data have shown that obesity independently increases colorectal cancer ( CRC ) risk , but the mechanisms are poorly understood .	
21147860_s1	Obesity is an inflammatory state , and chronic colonic inflammation induces CRC .	
21147860_s2	OBJECTIVE We conducted this proof-of-principle study to seek evidence of obesity-associated colorectal inflammation and to evaluate effects of diet-induced weight loss .	
21147860_s3	DESIGN We measured inflammatory cytokines , gene arrays , and macrophage infiltration in rectosigmoid mucosal biopsies of 10 obese premenopausal women [ mean Â± SD body mass index ( in kg/m(2) ) : 35 Â± 3.5 ] before and after weight loss induced by a very-low-calorie diet .	
21147860_s4	RESULTS Subjects lost a mean ( Â±SD ) of 10.1 Â± 1% of their initial weight .	
21147860_s5	Weight loss significantly reduced fasting blood glucose , total cholesterol , triglycerides , LDL , tumor necrosis factor-Î± ( TNF-Î± ) , and interleukin ( IL)-8 concentrations ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
21147860_s6	After weight loss , rectosigmoid biopsies showed a 25-57% reduction in TNF-Î± , IL-1Î² , IL-8 , and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 concentrations ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
21147860_s7	T cell and macrophage counts decreased by 28% and 42% , respectively ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
21147860_s8	Gene arrays showed dramatic down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine pathways , prostaglandin metabolism , and the transcription factors STAT3 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ) and nuclear transcription factor ÎºB .	tumor promoting inflammation
21147860_s9	Weight loss reduced expression of FOS and JUN genes and down-regulated oxidative stress pathways and the transcription factors ATF ( activating transcription factor ) and CREB ( cyclic AMP response element-binding ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
21147860_s10	CONCLUSIONS Our data show that diet-induced weight loss in obese individuals reduces colorectal inflammation and greatly modulates inflammatory and cancer-related gene pathways .	tumor promoting inflammation
21147860_s11	These data imply that obesity is accompanied by inflammation in the colorectal mucosa and that diet-induced weight loss reduces this inflammatory state and may thereby lower CRC risk .	tumor promoting inflammation
21152038_s0	SWAP-70 , a phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate ( PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) ) binding protein , has been suggested to be involved in transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) as well as membrane ruffling after growth factor stimulation of the cells .	
21152038_s1	A mutant , SWAP-70-374 , was found to be able to bind to F-actin in vitro , whereas wild-type SWAP-70 failed to do so .	
21152038_s2	This mutant was present at the plasma membrane without any stimulation while the wild-type protein was present only in the cytosol unless cells were stimulated with EGF .	
21152038_s3	Expression of this mutant in MEFs resulted in morphologic transformation , fast growth , and loss of contact inhibition , suggesting that SWAP-70 with this mutation can transform the cells .	evading growth suppressors
21152038_s4	ERK1/2 was activated in SWAP-70-374-transformed cells .	
21152038_s5	Use of MEK inhibitors revealed that the ERK1/2 pathway does not affect the cell growth of MEFs but is responsible for loss of contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
21152038_s6	To investigate the function of SWAP-70 further , drugs that can inhibit SWAP-70-dependent cell responses were screened .	
21152038_s7	Among various drugs , sanguinarine was found to inhibit transformation of MEFs by SWAP-70-374 .	
21152038_s8	This drug was able to inhibit SWAP-70-mediated membrane ruffling as well , suggesting that its effect was closely related to the SWAP-70 signaling pathway .	
21152038_s9	These results suggest that SWAP-70-374 can activate some signaling pathways , including the ERK1/2 pathway , to transform MEFs .	
21152298_s0	Lewis y ( LeY ) antigen is a difucosylated oligosaccharide carried by glycoconjugates on the cell surface .	
21152298_s1	Overexpression of LeY is frequently observed in epithelial-derived cancers and has been correlated to the pathological staging and prognosis .	
21152298_s2	However , the effects of LeY on ovarian cancer are not yet clear .	
21152298_s3	Previously , we transfected the ovarian cancer cell line RMG-I with the Î±1,2-fucosyltransferase gene to obtain stable transfectants , RMG-I-H , that highly express LeY .	
21152298_s4	In the present study , we examined the proliferation , tumorigenesis , adhesion and invasion of the cell lines with treatment of LeY monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) .	
21152298_s5	Additionally , we examined the expression of TGF-Î²1 , VEGF and b-FGF in xenograft tumors .	
21152298_s6	The results showed that the proliferation and adhesion in vitro were significantly inhibited by treatment of RMG-I-H cells with LeY mAb .	
21152298_s7	When subcutaneously inoculated in nude mice , RMG-I-H cells produced large tumors , while mock-transfected cells RMG-I-C and the parental cells RMG-I produced small tumors .	
21152298_s8	Moreover , the tumor formation by RMG-I-H cells was inhibited by preincubating the cells with LeY mAb .	
21152298_s9	Notably , the expression of TGF-Î²1 , VEGF and b-FGF all increased in RMG-I-H cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21152298_s10	In conclusion , LeY plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation , tumorigenecity and adhesion , and these effects may be related to increased levels of growth factors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21152298_s11	The LeY antibody shows potential application in the treatment of LeY-positive tumors .	
21156285_s0	Maintenance of genomic integrity is essential for adult tissue homeostasis and defects in the DNA-damage response ( DDR ) machinery are linked to numerous pathologies including cancer .	
21156285_s1	Here , we present evidence that the DDR exerts tumor suppressor activity in gliomas .	
21156285_s2	We show that genes encoding components of the DDR pathway are frequently altered in human gliomas and that loss of elements of the ATM/Chk2/p53 cascade accelerates tumor formation in a glioma mouse model .	evading growth suppressors
21156285_s3	We demonstrate that Chk2 is required for glioma response to ionizing radiation in vivo and is necessary for DNA-damage checkpoints in the neuronal stem cell compartment .	evading growth suppressors
21156285_s4	Finally , we observed that the DDR is constitutively activated in a subset of human GBMs , and such activation correlates with regions of hypoxia .	
21159663_s0	Melanoma progression is associated with the expression of different growth factors , cytokines , and chemokines .	
21159663_s1	Because TGFÎ²1 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved not only in physiologic processes but also in cancer development , we analyzed in A375 human melanoma cells , the effect of TGFÎ²1 on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) and interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) expression , two known factors responsible for melanoma progression .	
21159663_s2	TGFÎ²1 increased the expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 in A375 cells , an effect mediated by the cross-talk between Smad , PI3K ( phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT , and BRAF-MAPK ( mitogen activated protein kinase ) signaling pathways .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21159663_s3	Supernatants from TGFÎ²1-treated A375 cells enhanced MCP-1-dependent migration of monocytes , which , in turn , expressed high levels of TGF,Î²1 , bFGF , and VEGF mRNA .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21159663_s4	Moreover , these supernatants also inhibited functional properties of dendritic cells through IL-10-dependent mechanisms .	
21159663_s5	When using in vitro , the TGFÎ²1-blocking peptide P144 , TGFÎ²1-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation , and expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 were inhibited .	
21159663_s6	In vivo , treatment of A375 tumor-bearing athymic mice with P144 significantly reduced tumor growth , associated with a lower macrophage infiltrate and decreased intratumor MCP-1 and VEGF levels , as well as angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
21159663_s7	Finally , in C57BL/6 mice with B16-OVA melanoma tumors , when administered with immunotherapy , P144 decreased tumor growth and intratumor IL-10 levels , linked to enhanced activation of dendritic cells and natural killer cells , as well as anti-OVA T-cell responses .	
21159663_s8	These results show new effects of TGFÎ²1 on melanoma cells , which promote tumor progression and immunosuppression , strongly reinforcing the relevance of this cytokine as a molecular target in melanoma .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21166739_s0	Radiotherapy is a useful component of treatment strategies for esophageal cancer .	
21166739_s1	The role of autophagy in response to ionizing radiation was investigated in human esophageal squamous carcinoma cells .	
21166739_s2	Cell viability and clonogenic survival assay were used to evaluate the radiosensitivity of autophagy inhibitor ( 3-MA ) on esophageal squamous carcinoma cells .	
21166739_s3	The percentage of apoptotic cells and cell cycle analysis were assessed by flow cytometry ; DAPI staining was used to detect apoptotic cells .	
21166739_s4	The expression of beclin-1 and LC3 was measured using a Western blot .	
21166739_s5	The ultrastructural analysis was under the electron microscope. 6âGy irradiation induced a massive accumulation of autophagosomes accompanied by strong upregulation of beclin-1 and LC3-II expression in TE-1 cells .	resisting cell death
21166739_s6	Compared with radiation alone , 3-MA combined with radiation significantly decreased cell viability , as well as autophagic ratio , beclin-1 , and LC3-II protein level .	resisting cell death
21166739_s7	Inhibition of autophagy increased radiation-induced apoptosis and the percentage of G2/M-phase cells .	resisting cell death
21166739_s8	Blockade of autophagy with 3-MA enhanced cytotoxicity of radiotherapy in human esophageal squamous carcinoma cells .	resisting cell death
21166739_s9	It suggests that inhibition of autophagy could be used as adjuvant therapy to treat esophageal squamous cell carcinoma .	resisting cell death
21166888_s0	Currently there is no good hepatocyte model for studying growth hormone ( GH ) function that reflects its normal physiological roles .	
21166888_s1	Here we report the establishment of a functional hepatocyte cell line , SDRL-1 , from the liver of young male spontaneous dwarf rats ( SDR ) , with isolated GH deficiency .	
21166888_s2	This line has been maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM)/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) with retention of a near diploid karyotype for extended periods of time .	
21166888_s3	When grown as a monolayer sheet , it displayed a pavement-like appearance and contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
21166888_s4	These cells have a poorly developed rough endoplasmic reticulum ( r-ER ) , few mitochondria and glycogen granules , and produce a small amount of albumin and Î±-fetoprotein , that is enhanced when grown on a collagen gel sponge .	
21166888_s5	Human recombinant GH stimulated JAK2 and STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation and IGF-I production in a concentration-dependent manner .	
21166888_s6	When the cells were cultured with GH-supplemented medium , the number of mitochondria and glycogen granules increased together with the r-ER and Golgi apparatus .	
21166888_s7	A number of microvilli were observed on the surface of the cultured cells , further suggesting that this cell line is composed of normally functioning hepatocytes .	
21166888_s8	In summary , we established a novel hepatocyte cell line ( SDRL-1 ) , that appears to display normal function , which we propose can serve as a good in vitro model for studying GH-target organ interactions .	
21170084_s0	The polycomb group family protein BMI-1 is overexpressed by and functions as an oncogene in many different human cancers .	
21170084_s1	We have previously shown that BMI-1 promotes the tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma family tumors ( ESFTs ) and that this is mediated independently of CDKN2A repression .	
21170084_s2	In this study , we have discovered that high levels of BMI-1 confer resistance to contact inhibition in ESFT cells .	
21170084_s3	Using stable retroviral transduction , we evaluated the consequences of BMI-1 knockdown on the growth of CDKN2A wild-type and mutant ESFT cells in subconfluent and confluent conditions .	
21170084_s4	Although knockdown of BMI-1 had no effect on proliferation in low-density cultures , at high cell densities it resulted in cell cycle arrest and death .	
21170084_s5	The normal cell contact inhibition response is mediated , in large part , by the recently described Hippo pathway which functions to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell death by inactivating the Yes-Associated Protein ( YAP ) .	
21170084_s6	Significantly , we found that YAP levels , activity and expression did not diminish in confluent ESFT cells that expressed high levels of BMI-1 .	
21170084_s7	In contrast , YAP expression and nuclear localization were reduced in confluent BMI-1 knockdown cells suggesting that silencing of BMI-1 restored contact inhibition by restoring normal activation of the Hippo-YAP growth-suppressor pathway .	evading growth suppressors
21170084_s8	Importantly , knockdown of YAP in ESFT cells resulted in profound inhibition of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation suggesting that stabilization and continued expression of YAP is critical for ESFT growth and tumorigenicity .	
21170084_s9	Together , these studies reveal a previously unrecognized link between BMI-1 , contact inhibition and the Hippo-YAP pathway and suggest that resistance to contact inhibition in BMI-1 overexpressing cancer cells may be in part a result of Hippo inhibition and aberrant stabilization of YAP .	evading growth suppressors
21178304_s0	Extensive biochemical and structural analyses have been performed on the putative DNA repair proteins of hyperthermophilic archaea , in contrast to the few genetic analyses of the genes encoding these proteins .	
21178304_s1	Accordingly , little is known about the repair pathways used by archaeal cells at high temperature .	
21178304_s2	Here , we attempted to disrupt the genes encoding the potential repair proteins in the genome of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis .	
21178304_s3	We succeeded in isolating null mutants of the hjc , hef , hjm , xpb , and xpd genes , but not the radA , rad50 , mre11 , herA , nurA , and xpg/fen1 genes .	
21178304_s4	Phenotypic analyses of the gene-disrupted strains showed that the xpb and xpd null mutants are only slightly sensitive to ultraviolet ( UV ) irradiation , methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) and mitomycin C ( MMC ) , as compared with the wild-type strain .	
21178304_s5	The hjm null mutant showed sensitivity specifically to mitomycin C. On the other hand , the null mutants of the hjc gene lacked increasing sensitivity to any type of DNA damage .	
21178304_s6	The Hef protein is particularly important for maintaining genome homeostasis , by functioning in the repair of a wide variety of DNA damage in T. kodakaraensis cells .	genomic instability and mutation
21178304_s7	Deletion of the entire hef gene or of the segments encoding either its nuclease or helicase domain produced similar phenotypes .	
21178304_s8	The high sensitivity of the Îhef mutants to MMC suggests that Hef performs a critical function in the repair process of DNA interstrand cross-links .	genomic instability and mutation
21178304_s9	These damage-sensitivity profiles suggest that the archaeal DNA repair system has processes depending on repair-related proteins different from those of eukaryotic and bacterial DNA repair systems using homologous repair proteins analyzed here .	genomic instability and mutation
21183791_s0	DNA damage checkpoints in the cell cycle may be important barriers against cancer progression in human cells .	
21183791_s1	Fanconi anemia ( FA ) is an inherited DNA instability disorder that is associated with bone marrow failure and a strong predisposition to cancer .	
21183791_s2	Although FA cells experience constitutive chromosomal breaks , cell cycle arrest at the G2 DNA damage checkpoint , and an excess of cell death , some patients do become clinically stable , and the mechanisms underlying this , other than spontaneous reversion of the disease-causing mutation , are not well understood .	
21183791_s3	Here we have defined a clonal phenotype , termed attenuation , in which FA patients acquire an abrogation of the G2 checkpoint arrest .	
21183791_s4	Attenuated cells expressed lower levels of CHK1 ( also known as CHEK1 ) and p53 .	evading growth suppressors
21183791_s5	The attenuation could be recapitulated by modulating the ATR/CHK1 pathway , and CHK1 inhibition protected FA cells from cell death .	
21183791_s6	FA patients who expressed the attenuated phenotype had mild bone marrow deficiency and reached adulthood , but several of them eventually developed myelodysplasia or leukemia .	
21183791_s7	Better understanding of attenuation might help predict a patient's clinical course and guide choice of treatment .	
21183791_s8	Our results also highlight the importance of evaluating the cellular DNA damage checkpoint and repair pathways in cancer therapies in general .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
21188144_s0	BACKGROUND Induction of osteolytic bone lesions in multiple myeloma is caused by an uncoupling of osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation .	
21188144_s1	Current management of myeloma bone disease is limited to the use of antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates .	
21188144_s2	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We tested the effects of daily administered parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) on bone disease and myeloma growth , and we investigated molecular mechanisms by analyzing gene expression profiles of unique myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells engrafted in SCID-rab and SCID-hu mouse models .	
21188144_s3	PTH resulted in increased bone mineral density of myelomatous bones and reduced tumor burden , which reflected the dependence of primary myeloma cells on the bone marrow microenvironment .	
21188144_s4	Treatment with PTH also increased bone mineral density of uninvolved murine bones in myelomatous hosts and bone mineral density of implanted human bones in nonmyelomatous hosts .	
21188144_s5	In myelomatous bone , PTH markedly increased the number of osteoblasts and bone-formation parameters , and the number of osteoclasts was unaffected or moderately reduced .	
21188144_s6	Pretreatment with PTH before injecting myeloma cells increased bone mineral density of the implanted bone and delayed tumor progression .	
21188144_s7	Human global gene expression profiling of myelomatous bones from SCID-hu mice treated with PTH or saline revealed activation of multiple distinct pathways involved in bone formation and coupling ; involvement of Wnt signaling was prominent .	
21188144_s8	Treatment with PTH also downregulated markers typically expressed by osteoclasts and myeloma cells , and altered expression of genes that control oxidative stress and inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
21188144_s9	PTH receptors were not expressed by myeloma cells , and PTH had no effect on myeloma cell growth in vitro .	
21188144_s10	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE We conclude that PTH-induced bone formation in myelomatous bones is mediated by activation of multiple signaling pathways involved in osteoblastogenesis and attenuated bone resorption and myeloma growth ; mechanisms involve increased osteoblast production of anti-myeloma factors and minimized myeloma induction of inflammatory conditions .	
21189165_s0	Our purpose in this randomized , double blind , placebo controlled study was to find out the possible effect of a polyphenolic pine bark extract , PycnogenolÂ® ( Pyc ) on the level of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine ( 8-oxoG ) as representative of oxidative damage to DNA and on the DNA repair ability of elderly people .	
21189165_s1	According to our results , three months of Pyc administration had no effect on the level of oxidative damage to DNA or on repair ability , but we found a relationship between the level of 8-oxoG and repair ability of DNA in this group .	genomic instability and mutation
21189165_s2	To conclude , even if the positive effect of Pyc was not confirmed in the case of elderly people it is important to highlight the necessity of further investigations about the mechanisms of Pyc acting on different age groups .	
21190990_s0	Dentin matrix protein 1 ( DMP1 ) is a member of the small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein ( SIBLING ) family , a group of proteins initially described as mineralized extracellular matrices components .	
21190990_s1	More recently , SIBLINGs have been implicated in several key steps of cancer progression , including angiogenesis .	
21190990_s2	Although proangiogenic activities have been demonstrated for 2 SIBLINGs , the role of DMP1 in angiogenesis has not yet been addressed .	
21190990_s3	We demonstrate that this extracellular matrix protein induced the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin ( VE-cadherin ) , a key regulator of intercellular junctions and contact inhibition of growth of endothelial cells that is also known to modulate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) activity , the major high-affinity receptor for VEGF .	inducing angiogenesis
21190990_s4	DMP1 induced VE-cadherin and p27(Kip1) expression followed by cell-cycle arrest in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in a CD44-dependent manner .	evading growth suppressors
21190990_s5	VEGF-induced proliferation , migration , and tubulogenesis responses were specifically blocked on DMP1 pretreatment of HUVECs .	
21190990_s6	Indeed , after VE-cadherin induction , DMP1 inhibited VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and Src-mediated signaling .	
21190990_s7	However , DMP1 did not interfere with basic fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis .	
21190990_s8	In vivo , DMP1 significantly reduced laser-induced choroidal neovascularization lesions and tumor-associated angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
21190990_s9	These data enable us to put DMP1 on the angiogenic chessboard for the first time and to identify this protein as a new specific inhibitor of VEGF-induced angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
21197417_s0	Pegylated Interferon-Î±2b ( pIFN-Î± ) is an integral part of the drug regimen currently employed against melanoma .	
21197417_s1	Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the IFN response , cell cycle and apoptosis .	
21197417_s2	We have studied pIFN-Î± induced responses when combined with the chemotherapy agent , vinblastine in tumor and endothelial cell lines and the connection to IRF-1 signaling .	
21197417_s3	Levels of IRF-1/IRF-2 protein expression were found to be decreased in tumor versus normal tissues. pIFN-Î± induced IRF-1 signaling in human melanoma ( M14 ) and endothelial ( EA.hy926 ) cells and enhanced cell death when combined with vinblastine .	
21197417_s4	Upon combined IFN-Î± and vinblastine treatment , p21 expression , PARP cleavage and activated Bak levels were increased in M14 cells .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
21197417_s5	An increase in p21 and cyclin D1 expression occurred in EA.hy926 cells after 6 h of treatment with pIFN-Î± which dissipated by 24 h .	
21197417_s6	This biphasic response , characteristic of cellular senescence , was more pronounced upon combined treatment .	enabling replicative immortality
21197417_s7	Exposure of the EA.hy926 cells to pIFN-Î± was associated with an enlarged , multinucleated , Î²-galactosidase-positive senescent phenotype .	enabling replicative immortality
21197417_s8	The overall therapeutic mechanism of IFN-Î± combined with chemotherapy may be due to both direct tumor cell death via IRF-1 signaling and by premature senescence of endothelial cells and subsequent effects on angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment .	enabling replicative immortality,inducing angiogenesis
21198292_s0	Chemoprevention is one feasible approach to decreasing morbidity and mortality of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .	
21198292_s1	The present study aimed to explore the mechanisms of chemoprevention of NSCLC by Prunella vulgaris L .	
21198292_s2	( PV ) using a PV extract of 60% ethanol ( P-60 ) .	
21198292_s3	In an A/J mouse model benzo[a]pyrene induction of lung tumors was significantly reduced difference by P-60 group .	
21198292_s4	In addition , P-60 was found to have the ability to regulate cell cycle and induce apoptosis in SPC-A-1 cells .	evading growth suppressors
21198292_s5	Therefore , we propose that P-60 has potential as a lung cancer chemopreventive agent .	
21268915_s0	UNLABELLED Oxygen free radicals and their reactive derivatives participate in formation of chronic inflammation states , which facilitate development of gastrointestinal tract tumors .	
21268915_s1	Oxidative stress is one of the main causes of damage to cell membranes in result of exacerbated lipid peroxidation process .	
21268915_s2	End products of lipid peroxidation ( aldehydes , organic peroxides ) react with important biological macromolecules such as DNA and proteins , cause changes in cell membrane structure and properties leading to loss of its integrity .	
21268915_s3	Intensification of the lipid peroxidation process is a factor which may also lead to a malfunction in the antioxidant barrier , which further weakens the defense of cells against oxygen free radicals and promotes the onset and development of cancer .	
21268915_s4	The aim of the study was the determination of lipid peroxidation level in gastrointestinal tract tumors ( stomach , liver , colon , and colorectal cancer to liver metastases ) .	
21268915_s5	MATERIAL AND METHODS Materials for studies were obtained from 150 patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors : 10 with stomach cancer , 30 with malignant and benign liver cancers , 60 with primary colorectal cancer , and 50 with metachronous colorectal cancer liver metastases .	
21268915_s6	We also investigated 25 patients with liver cirrhosis , which was treated as a pre-cancerous condition .	
21268915_s7	In total , 175 patients were examined .	
21268915_s8	Tumor specimens , and normal adjacent tissues ( 6-7 cm from the edge of the tumor ) , which served as control tissue in studies , were collected from patients ( with their consent ) during surgery .	
21268915_s9	Additionally , liver specimens were collected from patients with liver cirrhosis .	
21268915_s10	Lipid peroxidation level was determined spectrophotometrically as a concentration of final lipid peroxidation products , which in reaction with tiobarbituric acid ( TBA ) form colour complex ( thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances - TBARS ) .	
21268915_s11	RESULTS The study showed the highest concentration of TBARS in benign , and the lowest in malignant liver tumors .	tumor promoting inflammation
21268915_s12	Other types of gastrointestinal tumors studied , were characterized by similar levels of lipid peroxidation .	tumor promoting inflammation
21268915_s13	TBARS concentration in these tumors was approximately 2-fold higher than in malignant liver tumors and much lower than in benign tumors .	tumor promoting inflammation
21268915_s14	In all cancers of the digestive tract with the exception of malignant liver tumors increased level of TBARS was found , comparing with control tissue .	tumor promoting inflammation
21268915_s15	The concentration of TBARS in cirrhotic liver was lower than in control .	tumor promoting inflammation
21268915_s16	The level of lipid peroxidation in liver cirrhosis and malignant liver tumors was similar .	tumor promoting inflammation
21268915_s17	There were no significant differences in TBARS concentration in the tumors of particular sections of the intestine and normal colon .	tumor promoting inflammation
21268915_s18	The highest concentration of TBARS was found in G1 grade of colorectal cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
21268915_s19	In subsequent grades of cells differentiation ( G2 and G3 ) its concentration was lower .	
21268915_s20	The highest level of lipid peroxidation , expressed as the concentration of TBARS was found in the I stage of colorectal cancer clinical advancement .	tumor promoting inflammation
21268915_s21	The significantly lowest concentration of TBARS was shown for stage II ( UICC ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
21268915_s22	CONCLUSIONS The level of lipid peroxidation in cancerous cells of gastrointestinal tract indicates increased oxidative stress .	tumor promoting inflammation
21268915_s23	The changes of lipid peroxidation level--a marker of oxidative stress in gastrointestinal tumors appear to be closely associated with their development stages ( liver cirrhosis/malignant liver cancer ; colorectal cancer/colorectal cancer liver metastases ) and are likely to create such conditions , in which cancerous cells may proliferate , undergo gradual dedifferentiation and malignancy , and generate metastases .	tumor promoting inflammation
21280565_s0	Cigarette smoke ( CS ) is a rich source of radicals , predisposing the cell to oxidative stress resulting in inflammation .	
21280565_s1	Chronic inflammation is a recognized risk factor for carcinogenesis .	
21280565_s2	Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) is a mediator of inflammatory pathway and may , therefore , contribute to carcinogenesis .	
21280565_s3	There are several reports that suggest the association between CS and COX-2 associated risk to cancer .	
21280565_s4	In the present study , we examined the role of celecoxib ( a selective COX-2 inhibitor ) in modulating the oxidative stress caused by CS inhalation in mice .	
21280565_s5	CS exposure for a period of 10 weeks caused oxidative stress in the pulmonary and hepatic tissues , as evident from the increase in lipid peroxidation levels ( LPO ) and decrease in reduced glutathione ( GSH ) levels .	tumor promoting inflammation
21280565_s6	Celecoxib ( 125 mg/kg body weight for 8 weeks ) administration to CS inhaling mice reduced the oxidative stress by decreasing the LPO levels and enhancing the GSH levels in comparison to the CS-exposed group .	tumor promoting inflammation
21280565_s7	CS exposure repressed the enzymatic antioxidant defense system , as evident from the decrease in catalase ( CAT ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activities .	tumor promoting inflammation
21280565_s8	Co-adminstration of celecoxib considerably reversed the changes in the enzymatic antioxidant defense system .	tumor promoting inflammation
21280565_s9	Histopathological studies of lungs showed that CS exposure induced alveolar wall destruction and air space enlargement .	
21280565_s10	In co-treated group , the alveolar septa were thicker than normal with apparent infiltration of inflammatory cells .	tumor promoting inflammation
21280565_s11	In CS-exposed group , hepatic tissue exhibited vacuolization and macrophage infiltration .	
21280565_s12	Co-treatment with celecoxib restored the normal histoarchitechture in hepatic tissues of CS inhaling mice .	
21280565_s13	Thus , the present study demonstrated that celecoxib adminstration reduced the oxidative stress-mediated risk to carcinogenesis , due to its ability to boost the antioxidant defense system .	tumor promoting inflammation
21318160_s0	Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) receptor agonists represent a new approach for the treatment of thrombocytopenia , which may develop as a consequence of immune thrombocytopenia , chemotherapy treatment , chronic hepatitis C infection , or myelodysplastic syndromes .	
21318160_s1	There are concerns that use of certain growth factors can hasten disease progression in some types of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors .	
21318160_s2	In this study , expression of MPL ( TPO-R ) mRNA was examined in tumor cell lines , patient tumor samples ( renal cell carcinoma , prostatic carcinoma , soft tissue and bony/cartilage sarcoma , colon cancer , and lymphoma ) , and normal tissues using microarray analysis and qRT-PCR .	
21318160_s3	MPL mRNA is expressed at very low or undetectable levels compared with erythropoietin receptor ( EPOR ) , human epidermal growth factor ( ERBB2 ; HER2 ) , and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF1R ) in these patient samples .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21318160_s4	These data suggest TPO-R agonists will likely preferentially stimulate proliferation and differentiation of cells of megakaryocytic lineage , potentially demonstrating their utility for correcting thrombocytopenia in clinical settings .	
21338203_s0	BACKGROUND Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are associated with ability to remove DNA lesions , and therefore may contribute to an individual's susceptibility to different types of cancer .	
21338203_s1	Base excision repair ( BER ) , and nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) are the main DNA repair pathways .	
21338203_s2	The present study was conducted to determine the frequency distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) selected for genes in these two pathways i.e .	
21338203_s3	OGG1 Exon 7 ( C1245G ) , XPC Intron 9 ( PAT ) , and Exon 15 ( A33512C ) in a North Indian population in comparison with global populations .	
21338203_s4	METHODS Genotyping was achieved by PCR-based analysis in 224 normal healthy , unrelated individuals of similar ethnicity .	
21338203_s5	RESULTS Allelic frequencies in wild type of OGG1 Exon 7 C&gt;G were 73% ( C ) ; XPC PAT D&gt;I 75% ( D ) ; and XPC Exon 15 A&gt;C 60.71.9% A. On the other hand , the variant allele frequency were 27% ( G ) in OGG1 Exon 7 C&gt;G ; 25% ( I ) in XPC PAT ; and 28.1% ( C ) in XPC Exon 15 A&gt;C .	
21338203_s6	Major differences from other ethnic populations were observed .	
21338203_s7	CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that frequency distribution in these DNA repair genes exhibited a distinctive pattern in our population which could be attributed to ethnic variation .	genomic instability and mutation
21338203_s8	This could assist in high-risk screening of humans exposed to environmental carcinogens and cancer predisposition in different ethnic groups .	
21358296_s0	OBJECTIVES Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) stimulates cell proliferation by binding to its receptor ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) , and the overexpression of this receptor is associated with poorer prognosis .	
21358296_s1	The EGF gene presents a polymorphism at position 61 ( A/G ) , associated with higher EGF production .	
21358296_s2	We examined the association between this polymorphism and cervical cancer through a case-control study .	
21358296_s3	METHODS This study used the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method on a sample of 384 women with cervical lesions and 500 controls of white ethnicity .	
21358296_s4	RESULTS In cases of cervical cancer , we found an increased risk of progression to advanced disease ( The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIb/IV ) ( odds ratios=2.05 ; 95% confidence intervals=1.11 to 3.79 ; P=0.021 ) , and this risk was particularly evident in G carriers for younger women ( odds ratios=2.96 ; 95% confidence intervals=1.41-6.20 , P=0.003 ) .	
21358296_s5	CONCLUSIONS We hypothesize the onset of an advanced disease-driven selective pressure due to the effect of oncogenic human papillomavirus types in a favorable genetic background observed in G carrier women .	
21358296_s6	These results suggest that EGF functional polymorphism may influence cervical cancer prognosis through an EGF/epidermal growth factor receptor pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21445621_s0	BACKGROUND Hesperidin , a flavanone present in citrus fruits , has been identified as a potent anticancer agent because of its proapoptotic and antiproliferative characteristics in some tumor cells .	
21445621_s1	However , the precise mechanisms of action are not entirely understood .	
21445621_s2	AIM The main purpose of this study is to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARÎ³ ) in hesperidin's anticancer actions in human pre-B NALM-6 cells , which expresses wild-type p53 .	
21445621_s3	METHODS The effects of hesperidin on cell-cycle distribution , proliferation , and caspase-mediated apoptosis were examined in NALM-6 cells in the presence or absence of GW9662 .	
21445621_s4	The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( PPARÎ³ ) , p53 , phospho-IÎºB , Bcl-2 , Bax , and XIAP proteins were focused on using the immunoblotting assay .	
21445621_s5	The transcriptional activities of PPARÎ³ and nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-ÎºB ) were analyzed by the transcription factor assay kits .	
21445621_s6	The expression of PPARÎ³ and p53 was analyzed using the RT-PCR method .	
21445621_s7	RESULTS Hesperidin induced the expression and transcriptional activity of PPARÎ³ and promoted p53 accumulation and downregulated constitutive NF-ÎºB activity in a PPARÎ³-dependent and PPARÎ³-independent manner .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21445621_s8	The growth-inhibitory effect of hesperidin was partially reduced when the cells preincubated with PPARÎ³ antagonist prior to the exposure to hesperidin .	
21445621_s9	CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study clearly demonstrate that hesperidin-mediated proapoptotic and antiproliferative actions are regulated via both PPARÎ³-dependent and PPARÎ³-independent pathways in NALM-6 cells .	resisting cell death
21445621_s10	These data provide the first evidence that hesperidin could be developed as an agent against hematopoietic malignancies .	
21462328_s0	SCOPE In this study , we evaluated the efficacy of lycopene against the growth of prostate cancer in vivo .	
21462328_s1	METHODS AND RESULTS Athymic nude mice were implanted subcutaneously with human androgen-independent prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells .	
21462328_s2	They were supplemented with a low or a high dose of lycopene ( 4 and 16âmg/kg ) and a single dose of Î²-carotene ( 16âmg/kg ) twice a week for 7 wk .	
21462328_s3	At the end of the experiment , both lycopene and Î²-carotene strongly inhibited the tumor growth , as evidenced by the decrease in tumor volume and tumor weight .	
21462328_s4	High-dosage lycopene and Î²-carotene significantly decreased the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in tumor tissues and increased the levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 in plasma .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21462328_s5	In addition , high-dosage lycopene supplementation significantly decreased the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) levels in plasma .	inducing angiogenesis
21462328_s6	In contrast , Î²-carotene supplementation significantly increased the VEGF levels , as compared with tumor control group .	inducing angiogenesis
21462328_s7	CONCLUSION Lycopene and Î²-carotene supplementation suppressed the growth of prostate tumor cells , and the effects are likely associated with reduction of proliferation ( attenuation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression ) and with interference of the insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling ( increased plasma insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 levels ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21462328_s8	Furthermore , the inhibition of VEGF by lycopene suggests that the antitumor mechanisms of lycopene also involve anti-angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
21541970_s0	BACKGROUND Prostate cancer ( PCa ) progression is often associated with transactivation of the androgen receptor ( AR ) by endogenous hormones/growth factors .	
21541970_s1	One such factor affecting growth , proliferation , and apoptostis ( pro-/anti- ) in various cancers is the adipokine leptin .	
21541970_s2	This research studied leptin-induced signaling and apoptosis in androgen sensitive ( LNCaP , PC3/AR ) and insensitive ( PC3 , DU145 ) PCa cell lines .	
21541970_s3	METHODS Signaling was studied by immunoblotting in cells overexpressing leptin receptors ( LRb ) , Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) , and kinase negative-HER2-YFP cDNAs .	
21541970_s4	Apoptosis was measured by immunoblotting of apoptotic proteins and by Hoechst staining of condensed DNA .	
21541970_s5	RESULTS Leptin rapidly induced activation of JAK2 , STAT3 , and MAPK ( ERK1/2 ) signaling cascades ; it may also induce HER2 transactivation via leptin-induced phospho-JAK2 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21541970_s6	Leptin was then shown to exert clear pro-apoptotic effects , increasing levels of caspase 3 , cleavage of its substrate , poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) to cleaved PARP(89) , levels of CK 18 , a cytoskeletal protein formed during apoptosis , and DNA condensation .	resisting cell death
21541970_s7	Kinase inhibitors indicated that leptin-induced apoptosis is probably mediated by balanced activation of JAK2/STAT3 , p38 MAPK , and PKC pathways in PCa cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21541970_s8	A human leptin mutein LRb antagonist , L39A/D40A/F41A , fully inhibited leptin-induced phosphorylation of JAK2 , ERK1/2 , and Akt/PKB , and partially abrogated effects on apoptotic proteins .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
21541970_s9	In LNCaP and PC3/AR cells , leptin increased AR protein levels in correlation with raised apoptotic markers .	resisting cell death
21541970_s10	Thus , AR may mediate , at least partly , the leptin-induced apoptotic response .	resisting cell death
21541970_s11	CONCLUSIONS Leptin can clearly induce apoptosis in human PCa cell lines .	resisting cell death
21541970_s12	These findings could lead to development of new leptin agonists with enhanced pro-apoptotic effects and targeted for use in human PCa .	
21553290_s0	E6-associated protein ( E6-AP ) is a dual function protein .	
21553290_s1	It acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase enzyme and coactivator of steroid hormone receptors such as estrogen ( ERÎ± ) and progesterone ( PR ) receptors .	
21553290_s2	It promotes the degradation of ERÎ± and PR through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway .	
21553290_s3	Furthermore , it has been shown that the levels of E6-AP are inversely associated with that of ERÎ± in human breast tumors .	
21553290_s4	But the role of wild-type human E6-AP and its ubiquitin-protein ligase activity in mammary tumorigenesis is still unknown .	
21553290_s5	To investigate this role , the authors utilized transgenic mice lines that specifically overexpress either the wild-type human E6-AP ( E6-AP(WT) ) or the ubiquitin-protein ligase defective E6-AP that contains C833S mutation ( E6-AP(C833S) ) in the mammary gland .	
21553290_s6	To further substantiate the role of E6-AP in the development of breast tumorigenesis , it was also examined the expression of E6-AP in a large cohort of human breast cancer samples .	
21553290_s7	The transgenic mice that overexpress wild-type E6-AP ( E6-AP(WT) ) fail to develop mammary tumors .	
21553290_s8	Unlike the E6-AP(WT) mice , the E6-AP(C833S) mice that overexpress ubiquitin-protein ligase defective E6-AP protein develop mammary hyperplasia with a median latency of 18months .	
21553290_s9	These observations suggest that the inactivation of the ubiquitin-protein ligase function of E6-AP is sufficient to initiate the process of mammary tumor development .	
21553290_s10	Furthermore , the data also suggests that E6-AP exerts its effects on target cells by modulating the protein levels and functions of ERÎ± and PR .	
21553290_s11	In addition , it was found in human breast cancer patients that the level of E6-AP is decreased in invasive breast tumors compared to normal breast tissue .	activating invasion and metastasis
21553290_s12	Moreover , the authors also show that the survival patterns for E6-AP negative patients were worse compared to E6-AP positive patients .	
21553290_s13	Taken together , these data suggests that E6-AP may act as a tumor suppressor in breast .	
21604273_s0	NK1 is a tachykinin receptor highly relevant to tumorigenesis and metastasis development in breast cancer and other carcinomas .	
21604273_s1	Despite the substantial efforts done to develop potent NK1 receptor antagonists , none of these antagonists had shown good antitumor activity in clinical trials .	
21604273_s2	Now , we have tested the effect of inhibition of the neuropeptide Substance P ( SP ) , a NK1 ligand , as a potential therapeutic approach in cancer .	
21604273_s3	We found that the inhibition of SP with antibodies strongly inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in breast , colon , and prostate cancer cell lines .	resisting cell death
21604273_s4	These effects were accompained by a decrease in the mitogen-activated kinase singaling pathway .	
21604273_s5	Interestingly , in some cell lines SP abrogation decreased the steady state of Her2 and EGFR , suggesting that SP-mediated signaling is important for the basal activity of these ErbB receptors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21604273_s6	In consequence , we observed a blockade of the cell cycle progression and the inhibition of several cell cycle-related proteins including mTOR .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21604273_s7	SP inhibition also induced cell death in cell lines resistant to Lapatinib and Trastuzumab that have increased levels of active Her2 , suggesting that this therapeutic approach could be also effective for those cancers resistant to current anti-ErbB therapies .	resisting cell death
21604273_s8	Thus , we propose a new therapeutic strategy for those cancers that express NK1 receptor and/or other tachykinin receptors , based in the immuno-blockade of the neuropeptide SP .	
21658718_s0	BACKGROUND Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , a potent regulator of cellular homeostasis , is associated with aggressive tumor behavior .	
21658718_s1	The mechanism by which EGFR inhibition functions is unclear , with controversial results demonstrating an effect on the tumor cells , endothelial cells , or pericytes .	
21658718_s2	EGFR activation has been linked to the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , a known mitogen of angiogenesis , but the relationship between these factors and their effect on tumor vessel development is vague .	
21658718_s3	We hypothesized that using an EGFR inhibitor on a human Ewing's sarcoma model would inhibit tumor growth by suppressing vessel proliferation .	
21658718_s4	METHODS A cell proliferation assay was performed on the Ewing's sarcoma ( SK-NEP-1 ) cell line .	
21658718_s5	Tumor cells were implanted intrarenally in athymic mice .	
21658718_s6	Animals received daily gavage with vehicle or gefitinib 1 wk following implantation .	
21658718_s7	Mice ( n = 12/cohort ) were euthanized 6 wk following implantation .	
21658718_s8	Remaining mice were maintained without treatment for 2 wk .	
21658718_s9	Vascular changes were assessed by angiography and immunohistochemically .	
21658718_s10	EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) .	
21658718_s11	RESULTS Gefitinib suppressed in vitro cell growth with an IC(50) = 1.36 Î¼M .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21658718_s12	Minimal tumor growth suppression was noted at 6 wk ( 6.01 ï¿½ 1.2 g in control versus 4.61 ï¿½ 0.9 g treated , P = 0.36 ) .	
21658718_s13	After cessation of gefitinib , tumor growth was increased in both groups ( 7.37 ï¿½ 1.62 g versus 6.77 ï¿½ 1.53 g , P = 0.79 ) .	
21658718_s14	Microvessel density was unchanged despite EGFR inhibition ( 161,000 ï¿½ 16,000 pixels versus 135,000 ï¿½ 18,000 pixels , P = 0.31 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
21658718_s15	At 6 wk , the vascular maturity index was similar in both groups ( 3.63 ï¿½ 1.12 versus 4.09 ï¿½ 1.71 , P = 0.83 ) .	
21658718_s16	A downward trend in EGFR expression ( 49% of control ) and an upward trend in VEGF levels ( 50% of control ) occurred in the treated group .	inducing angiogenesis
21658718_s17	CONCLUSIONS EGFR expression was suppressed in cultured cells and xenograft tumors .	
21658718_s18	Despite a cytotoxic effect on cell lines , gefitinib had little effect on tumor growth .	
21658718_s19	No effects on the tumor vasculature were noted in the setting of EGFR suppression , suggesting that angiogenesis induced by SK-NEP-1 cells is refractory to EGFR inhibition .	inducing angiogenesis
21658718_s20	Interestingly , the resulting increase in VEGF expression following EGFR blockade , provides an alternative pro-angiogenic pathway promoting tumor survival .	inducing angiogenesis
21739465_s0	BACKGROUND Androgens and the androgen receptor ( AR ) play important roles in the development of male urogenital organs .	
21739465_s1	We previously found that mice with total AR knockout ( ARKO ) and epithelial ARKO failed to develop normal prostate with loss of differentiation .	
21739465_s2	We have recently knocked out AR gene in smooth muscle cells and found the reduced luminal infolding and IGF-1 production in the mouse prostate .	
21739465_s3	However , AR roles of stromal fibroblasts in prostate development remain unclear .	
21739465_s4	METHODS To further probe the stromal fibroblast AR roles in prostate development , we generated tissue-selective knockout mice with the AR gene deleted in stromal fibroblasts ( FSP-ARKO ) .	
21739465_s5	We also used primary culture stromal cells to confirm the in vivo data and investigate mechanisms related to prostate development .	
21739465_s6	RESULTS The results showed cellular alterations in the FSP-ARKO mouse prostate with decreased epithelial proliferation , increased apoptosis , and decreased collagen composition .	resisting cell death
21739465_s7	Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that FSP-ARKO mice have defects in the expression of prostate stromal growth factors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21739465_s8	To further confirm these in vivo findings , we prepared primary cultured mouse prostate stromal cells and found knocking down the stromal AR could result in growth retardation of prostate stromal cells and co-cultured prostate epithelial cells , as well as decrease of some stromal growth factors .	
21739465_s9	CONCLUSIONS Our FSP-ARKO mice not only provide the first in vivo evidence in Cre-loxP knockout system for the requirement of stromal fibroblast AR to maintain the normal development of the prostate , but may also suggest the selective knockdown of stromal AR might become a potential therapeutic approach to battle prostate hyperplasia and cancer .	
21779449_s0	Identification of the proteins that are associated with estrogen receptor ( ER ) status is a first step towards better understanding of the hormone-dependent nature of breast carcinogenesis .	
21779449_s1	Although a number of gene expression analyses have been conducted , protein complement has not been systematically investigated to date .	
21779449_s2	Because proteins are primary targets of therapeutic drugs , in this study , we have attempted to identify proteomic signatures that demarcate ER-positive and -negative breast cancers .	
21779449_s3	Using highly enriched breast tumor cells , replicate analyses from 3 ERÎ±+ and 3 ERÎ±- human breast tumors resulted in the identification of 2,995 unique proteins with â¥2 peptides .	
21779449_s4	Among these , a number of receptor tyrosine kinases and intracellular kinases that are abundantly expressed in ERÎ±+ and ERÎ±- breast cancer tissues were identified .	
21779449_s5	Further , label-free quantitative proteome analysis revealed that 236 proteins were differentially expressed in ERÎ±+ and ERÎ±- breast tumors .	
21779449_s6	Among these , 141 proteins were selectively up-regulated in ERÎ±+ , and 95 proteins were selectively up-regulated in ERÎ±- breast tumors .	
21779449_s7	Comparison of differentially expressed proteins with a breast cancer database revealed 98 among these have been previously reported to be involved in breast cancer .	
21779449_s8	By Gene Ontology molecular function , dehydrogenase , reductase , cytoskeletal proteins , extracellular matrix , hydrolase , and lyase categories were significantly enriched in ERÎ±+ , whereas selected calcium-binding protein , membrane traffic protein , and cytoskeletal protein were enriched in ERÎ±- breast tumors .	
21779449_s9	Biological process and pathway analysis revealed that up-regulated proteins of ERÎ±+ were overrepresented by proteins involved in amino acid metabolism , proteasome , and fatty acid metabolism , while up-regulated proteins of ERÎ±- were overrepresented by proteins involved in glycolysis pathway .	cellular energetics
21779449_s10	The presence and relative abundance of 4 selected differentially abundant proteins ( liprin-Î±1 , fascin , DAP5 , and Î²-arrestin-1 ) were quantified and validated by immunohistochemistry .	
21779449_s11	In conclusion , unlike in vitro cell culture models , the in vivo signaling proteins and pathways that we have identified directly from human breast cancer tissues may serve as relevant therapeutic targets for the pharmacological intervention of breast cancer .	
21780103_s0	The androgen receptor ( AR ) plays a central role in prostate cancer progression to the castration-resistant ( CR ) lethal state .	
21780103_s1	L-Dopa decarboxylase ( DDC ) is an AR coactivator that increases in expression with disease progression and is coexpressed with the receptor in prostate adenocarcinoma cells , where it may enhance AR activity .	
21780103_s2	Here , we hypothesize that the DDC enzymatic inhibitor , carbidopa , can suppress DDC-coactivation of AR and retard prostate tumor growth .	
21780103_s3	Treating LNCaP prostate cancer cells with carbidopa in transcriptional assays suppressed the enhanced AR transactivation seen with DDC overexpression and decreased prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) mRNA levels .	
21780103_s4	Carbidopa dose-dependently inhibited cell growth and decreased survival in LNCaP cell proliferation and apoptosis assays .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
21780103_s5	The inhibitory effect of carbidopa on DDC-coactivation of AR and cell growth/survival was also observed in PC3 prostate cancer cells ( stably expressing AR ) .	
21780103_s6	In vivo studies demonstrated that serum PSA velocity and tumor growth rates elevated â¼2-fold in LNCaP xenografts , inducibly overexpressing DDC , were reverted to control levels with carbidopa administration .	
21780103_s7	In castrated mice , treating LNCaP tumors , expressing endogenous DDC , with carbidopa delayed progression to the CR state from 6 to 10 weeks , while serum PSA and tumor growth decreased 4.3-fold and 5.4-fold , respectively .	
21780103_s8	Our study is a first time demonstration that carbidopa can abrogate DDC-coactivation of AR in prostate cancer cells and tumors , decrease serum PSA , reduce tumor growth and delay CR progression .	
21780103_s9	Since carbidopa is clinically approved , it may be readily used as a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress aberrant AR activity and delay prostate cancer progression .	
21816206_s0	Ruthenium(II) methylimidazole complexes , with the general formula [ Ru(MeIm)(4)(Nâ¢N)](2+) ( Nâ¢N=tip ( RMC1 ) , iip ( RMC2 ) , dppz ( RMC3 ) , dpq ( RMC4 ) ; MeIm=1-methylimidazole , tip=2-(thiophene-2-yl)-1H-imidazo [ 4,5-f ] [ 1,10]phenanthroline , iip=2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)-1H-imidazo [ 4,5-f ] [ 1,10]phenanthroline , dppz=dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine , dpq=pyrazino [ 2,3-f ] [ 1,10]phenanthroline ) , were synthesized and characterized .	
21816206_s1	As determined by MTT ( 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ) assay , these complexes displayed potent anti-proliferation activity against various cancer cells .	
21816206_s2	RMC1 inhibited the growth of A549 ( human lung adenocarcinoma ) lung cells through induction of apoptotic cell death , as evidenced by the accumulation of cell population in sub-G1 phase .	resisting cell death
21816206_s3	RMC1 also induced the depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential in A549 cells by regulating the expression of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members .	resisting cell death
21816206_s4	Another experiment showed that Bid protein was also activated by RMC1 , which implied that RMC1 could existed two pathways crosstalk , namely , have exogenous death receptor signaling pathway .	resisting cell death
21816206_s5	These results demonstrated that RMC1 induced cancer cell death by acting on both mitochondrial and death receptor apoptotic pathways , suggesting that RMC1 could be a candidate for further evaluation as a chemotherapeutic agent against human cancers .	resisting cell death
21921941_s0	Glioma tumors are refractory to conventional treatment .	
21921941_s1	Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumors in humans .	
21921941_s2	In this study , we introduce oxidative stress-energy depletion ( OSED ) therapy as a new suggested treatment for glioblastoma .	
21921941_s3	OSED utilizes D-amino acid oxidase ( DAO ) , which is a promising therapeutic protein that induces oxidative stress and apoptosis through generating hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) .	
21921941_s4	OSED combines DAO with 3-bromopyruvate ( 3BP ) , a hexokinase II ( HK II ) inhibitor that interferes with Warburg effect , a metabolic alteration of most tumor cells that is characterized by enhanced aerobic glycolysis .	
21921941_s5	Our data revealed that 3BP induced depletion of energetic capabilities of glioma cells. 3BP induced H2O2 production as a novel mechanism of its action .	cellular energetics
21921941_s6	C6 glioma transfected with DAO and treated with D-serine together with 3BP-sensitized glioma cells to 3BP and decreased markedly proliferation , clonogenic power and viability in a three-dimensional tumor model with lesser effect on normal astrocytes .	
21921941_s7	DAO gene therapy using atelocollagen as an in vivo transfection agent proved effective in a glioma tumor model in Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats , especially after combination with 3BP .	
21921941_s8	OSED treatment was safe and tolerable in SD rats .	
21921941_s9	OSED therapy may be a promising therapeutic modality for glioma .	
21940234_s0	BACKGROUND As a highly conserved system , the activation of the Notch pathway has been implicated in the tumorigenesis of various hematologic diseases , including leukemias , lymphomas , and multiple myeloma .	
21940234_s1	The Notch3 receptor is frequently expressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) .	
21940234_s2	METHODS To explore its possibility as a therapeutic target for T-ALL , we investigated the effect of Notch3 silencing on Jurkat and SupT1 cells using a novel tumor-specific short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) driven by survivin promoters .	
21940234_s3	RESULTS We found that downregulated expression of Notch3 correlated with significant apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation .	resisting cell death
21940234_s4	CONCLUSION These facts suggest that downregulating expression of Notch3 could attenuate the Notch signaling activity in T-ALL .	
21940234_s5	All these results indicate that inhibition of Notch3 expression can result in potent antitumor activity in T-ALL .	
21975289_s0	BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the most common liver cancer .	
21975289_s1	Therapeutic results are usually unsatisfactory because liver tumors recur often .	
21975289_s2	Immunologic factors may be related to the recurrence of HCC ; however , this possibility is mentioned only rarely .	
21975289_s3	METHODS Thirty HCC patients undergoing hepatectomies were divided into 3 groups according to the diameters of their HCCs : group A ( n = 8 ) , diameter â¤3 cm ; group B ( n = 8 ) , diameter &gt;3 cm and â¤5 cm ; and group C ( n = 14 ) , diameter &gt;5 cm .	
21975289_s4	T-lymphocytes from peripheral blood , nontumor liver tissue , and the HCC were analyzed .	
21975289_s5	RESULTS The percentage of CD25+ in the CD4+ T cells did not differ between the peripheral blood and the nontumor liver tissue among the 3 groups .	tumor promoting inflammation
21975289_s6	CD25+ cells were increased in the tumor tissue in group C patients ( range , 6-41% ; median , 22.9% ; P = .003 ) , compared to group A patients .	
21975289_s7	The percentage of CD25+ in the CD4+ T cells in tumor tissue was positively correlated with tumor sizes ( r = 0.556 ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
21975289_s8	These CD4+ CD25+ lymphocytes produced transforming growth factor-Î² and interferon-Î³ but not interleukin-10 , and were anergic to plate-coated monoclonal antibodies ( anti-CD3/anti-CD28 ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
21975289_s9	The characteristics of these antibodies were comparable to those of regulatory T cells .	tumor promoting inflammation
21975289_s10	When the infiltration lymphocytes including CD4+ CD25+ T cells were added to the mixed lymphocyte reaction activated by autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells , the proliferation of lymphocytes was inhibited .	tumor promoting inflammation
21975289_s11	CONCLUSION The increase of CD4+ CD25+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment correlates with tumor sizes .	tumor promoting inflammation
21975289_s12	These CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells appeared to suppress the immune response activated by dendritic cells .	tumor promoting inflammation
21994129_s0	Thyroid hormone ( T(3) ) mediates cellular growth , development , and differentiation by binding to the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor ( TR ) .	
21994129_s1	Recent studies suggest that long-term hypothyroidism is associated with human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) independent from other major HCC risk factors .	
21994129_s2	Dickkopf ( DKK ) 4 , a secreted protein , antagonizes the Wnt signal pathway .	
21994129_s3	In this study , we demonstrate that T(3) may play a suppressor role by inducing DKK4 expression in HCC cells at both the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and protein levels .	
21994129_s4	DKK4 was down-regulated in 67.5% of HCC cancerous tissues .	
21994129_s5	The decrease in DKK4 levels was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in TR protein levels in the matched cancerous tissues in 31% of tissues compared by immunoblotting with the adjacent noncancerous tissues .	
21994129_s6	Further , TR and DKK4 expression levels were positively correlated in both normal and cancerous specimens by tissue array analysis .	
21994129_s7	In function assays , stable DKK4 transfected into J7 or HepG2 cells decreased cell invasion in vitro .	activating invasion and metastasis
21994129_s8	Conversely , knocking down DKK4 restores cell invasiveness .	activating invasion and metastasis
21994129_s9	DKK4-expressing J7 clones showed increased degradation of Î²-catenin , but down-regulation of CD44 , cyclin D1 , and c-Jun .	
21994129_s10	To investigate the effect of DKK4 and TR on tumor growth in vivo , we established a xenograft of J7 cells in nude mice .	
21994129_s11	J7-DKK4 and J7-TRÎ±1 overexpressing mice , which displayed growth arrest , lower lung colony formation index , and smaller tumor size than in control mice , supporting an inhibitory role of DKK4 in tumor progression .	
21994129_s12	CONCLUSION : Taken together , these data suggest that the TR/DKK4/Wnt/Î²-catenin cascade influences the proliferation and migration of hepatoma cells during the metastasis process and support a tumor suppressor role of the TR .	
22014978_s0	Uncontrolled estrogen exposure can induce an imbalance in BCL2/BAX expression in endometrial cells , leading to precancerous lesions and type I endometrial adenocarcinoma .	
22014978_s1	This study aimed to explore the mechanism underlying this phenomenon .	
22014978_s2	We show that the activated estrogen receptor can suppress the expression of BAX by upregulating a group of microRNAs including hsa-let-7 family members and hsa-miR-27a , thereby promoting an increased BCL2/BAX ratio as well as enhanced survival and proliferation in the affected cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22014978_s3	These ER-regulated hsa-let-7 microRNAs can be detected in most hyperplastic endometria , suggesting their potential utility as indicators of estrogen over-exposure .	
22025280_s0	Nitric oxide ( NO ) shows tumoricidal activity .	
22025280_s1	We had previously reported that NO downregulates the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway , but upregulates the MEK/ERK pathway downstream of growth factor signaling .	
22025280_s2	We hypothesized that NO donor and MEK inhibitor in combination synergistically inhibit the viability of cancer cells compared to either NO donor or MEK inhibitor alone .	
22025280_s3	We determined the effects of S-nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO , NO-donor ) and U0126 ( MEK inhibitor ) on insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) signaling , proliferation and invasion in cancer cell lines .	
22025280_s4	GSNO inhibits phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor ( IGF-IR ) , EGF receptor ( EGFR ) and Akt , but upregulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in MIAPaCa-2 and HCT-116 cells after stimulation by IGF-I and EGF .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22025280_s5	On the other hand , U0126 inhibits phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , but upregulates phosphorylation of IGF-IR and EGFR in MIAPaCa-2 and HCT-116 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22025280_s6	The combination of GSNO and U0126 downregulates phosphorylation of IGF-IR , EGFR , Akt and ERK1/2 after stimulation by IGF-I and EGF .	
22025280_s7	GSNO as well as U0126 , inhibits the proliferation of MIAPaCa-2 , HCT-116 , Panc-1 , MCF-7 , HT-29 and AGS cells in a dose-dependent manner .	
22025280_s8	GSNO and U0126 in combination synergistically inhibit proliferation and invasion of cancer cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22025280_s9	These results indicate that the combined treatment of NO donor and MEK inhibitor may be promising in cancer therapy .	
22027089_s0	Zinc dyshomeostasis can induce cell death .	
22027089_s1	However , the mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated in prostate cancer ( PCa ) cells , which differ dramatically from normal cells in their zinc handling ability .	
22027089_s2	Here , we studied the effects of the ionophore Zn-pyrithione ( ZP ) and the chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine ( TPEN ) .	
22027089_s3	Both compounds induced cell death at micromolar concentrations when incubated with androgen-dependent ( LNCaP ) , androgen-independent ( PC3 , DU145 ) and androgen-sensitive ( C4-2 ) PCa cell-lines .	
22027089_s4	Compared to PCa cells , RWPE1 prostate epithelial cells were less sensitive to ZP and more sensitive to TPEN , but total cellular zinc levels were changed similarly .	
22027089_s5	ZnSO4 enhanced the toxicity of ZP , but inhibited the effects of TPEN as expected .	
22027089_s6	The morphological/biochemical responses to ZP and TPEN differed .	
22027089_s7	ZP decreased ATP levels and stimulated ERK , AKT and PKC phosphorylation .	
22027089_s8	DNA laddering was observed only at low doses of ZP but all doses of TPEN .	
22027089_s9	TPEN activated caspase 3/7 and induced PARP-cleavage , DNA-fragmentation , ROS-formation and apoptotic bodies .	resisting cell death
22027089_s10	PKC and ERK-pathway inhibitors , and antioxidants protected against ZP-induced but not TPEN-induced death .	
22027089_s11	Inhibitors of MPTP-opening protected both .	
22027089_s12	Cell death in response to TPEN ( but not ZP ) was diminished by a calpain inhibitor and largely prevented by a caspase 3 inhibitor .	
22027089_s13	Overall , the results indicated primarily a necrotic cell death for ZP and an apoptotic cell death for TPEN .	
22027089_s14	The enhanced sensitivity of PCa cells to ZP and the apparent ability of ZP and TPEN to kill quiescent and rapidly dividing cells in a p53-independent manner suggest that ZP/TPEN might be used to develop adjunct treatments for PCa .	
22044563_s0	Insulin-like growth factor ( IGF)-I receptor ( IGF-IR ) signaling is required for carcinogenicity and progression of several cancers but the function of this pathway and its utility as a therapeutic target have not been studied comprehensively in biliary tract carcinomas ( BTC ) .	
22044563_s1	We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of elements of the IGF axis , matrilysin , overexpression of p53 and the methylation status of the IGFBP-3 promoter in 80 surgically resected BTC .	
22044563_s2	We also assessed the effect of IGF-IR blockade on signal transduction , proliferation and survival in three BTC cell lines using a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor , BMS-536924 , and dominant negative IGF-IR ( IGF-IR/dn ) .	
22044563_s3	The effects of IGF-IR blockade was also studied in nude mouse xenograft models .	
22044563_s4	IGF-I was expressed in 60% and IGF-II in 50% of tumors .	
22044563_s5	High expression was associated with tumor size .	
22044563_s6	IGF-IR was expressed in 69% of the cases and was associated with advanced stage and matrilysin expression .	
22044563_s7	Hypermethylation of the IGFBP-3 promoter was detected in 41% of BTC and was inversely correlated with p53 expression .	
22044563_s8	BMS-536924 blocked autophosphorylation of IGF-IR and both Akt and ERK activation by both IGF-I and insulin .	
22044563_s9	BMS-536924 suppressed proliferation and tumorigenicity in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion .	
22044563_s10	This inhibitor upregulated chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion .	resisting cell death
22044563_s11	Moreover , IGF-IR blockade was effective against tumors in mice .	
22044563_s12	IGF-IR might identify a subset of BTC with a particularly aggressive phenotype and is a candidate therapeutic target in this disease .	
22044563_s13	BMS-536924 might have significant therapeutic utility .	
22048816_s0	Breast cancer is the malignant neoplasia with the highest incidence in women worldwide .	
22048816_s1	Chronic oxidative stress and inflammation have been indicated as major mediators during carcinogenesis and cancer progression .	
22048816_s2	Human studies have not considered the complexity of tumor biology during the stages of cancer advance , limiting their clinical application .	
22048816_s3	The purpose of this study was to characterize systemic oxidative stress and immune response parameters in early ( ED ; TNM I and II ) and advanced disease ( AD ; TNM III and IV ) of patients diagnosed with infiltrative ductal carcinoma breast cancer .	
22048816_s4	Oxidative stress parameters were evaluated by plasmatic lipoperoxidation , carbonyl content , thiobarbituric reactive substances ( TBARS ) , nitric oxide levels ( NO ) , total radical antioxidant parameter ( TRAP ) , superoxide dismutase , and catalase activities and GSH levels .	
22048816_s5	Immune evaluation was determined by TNF-Î± , IL-1Î² , IL-12 , and IL-10 levels and leukocytes oxidative burst evaluation by chemiluminescence .	
22048816_s6	Tissue damage analysis included heart ( total CK and CKMB ) , liver ( AST , ALT , GGT ) , and renal ( creatinine , urea , and uric acid ) plasmatic markers .	
22048816_s7	C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and iron metabolism were also evaluated .	
22048816_s8	Analysis of the results verified different oxidative stress statuses occur at distinct cancer stages .	
22048816_s9	ED was characterized by reduction in catalase , 8-isoprostanes , and GSH levels , with enhanced lipid peroxidation and TBARS levels .	tumor promoting inflammation
22048816_s10	AD exhibited more pronounced oxidative status , with reduction in catalase activity and TRAP , intense lipid peroxidation and high levels of NO , TBARs , and carbonyl content .	tumor promoting inflammation
22048816_s11	ED patients presented a Th2 immune pattern , while AD exhibited Th1 status .	
22048816_s12	CRP levels and ferritin were increased in both stages of disease .	
22048816_s13	Leukocytes burst impairment was observed in both the groups .	
22048816_s14	Plasma iron levels were significantly elevated in AD .	
22048816_s15	The data obtained indicated that oxidative stress enhancement and immune response impairment may be necessary to ensure cancer progression to advanced stages and may result from both host and tumor inflammatory mediators .	
22053106_s0	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ ( PPARÎ³ ) is an anti-inflammatory molecule .	
22053106_s1	To study its biologic function in myeloid cells , dominant-negative PPARÎ³ ( dnPPARÎ³ ) was overexpressed in a myeloid-specific bitransgenic mouse model .	
22053106_s2	In this bitransgenic system , overexpression of the dnPPARÎ³-Flag fusion protein in myeloid-lineage cells abnormally elevated frequencies and total numbers of IL-7RÎ±(-)Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(-) , Lin(-)/Scal(+)/c-Kit(+) , common myeloid , and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor populations in the BM. dnPPARÎ³ overexpression led to up-regulation of IL-1Î² , IL-6 , and TNFÎ± in the blood plasma .	
22053106_s3	As a result , CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) cells were systemically increased in association with activation of Stat3 , NF-ÎºB , Erk1/2 , and p38 molecules .	
22053106_s4	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) inhibited the proliferation and lymphokine production of wild-type CD4+ T cells in vitro .	sustaining proliferative signaling,tumor promoting inflammation
22053106_s5	CD4+ T cells from doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice displayed reduced proliferation and lymphokine release .	
22053106_s6	Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations were decreased in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice .	tumor promoting inflammation
22053106_s7	Multiple forms of carcinoma and sarcoma in the lung , liver , spleen , and lymph nodes were observed in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice .	
22053106_s8	BM transplantation revealed that a myeloid-autonomous defect was responsible for MDSC expansion , immunosuppression , and tumorigenesis in these mice .	
22053106_s9	These studies suggest that anti-inflammatory PPARÎ³ in myeloid-lineage cells plays a key role in controlling pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis , MDSC expansion , immunosuppression , and the development of cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
22083956_s0	Estrogen receptor ( ER ) and NF-ÎºB are transcription factors with profound effects on breast cancer cell proliferation and survival .	
22083956_s1	While many studies demonstrate that ER and NF-ÎºB can repress each other , we previously identified a gene signature that is synergistically upregulated by these two factors in more aggressive luminal B breast tumors .	
22083956_s2	Herein , we examine a novel mechanism of cross talk between ER and NF-ÎºB that results in the upregulation of the antiapoptotic gene BIRC3 ( also known as cIAP2 ) .	
22083956_s3	We demonstrate that NF-ÎºB , acting through two response elements , is required for ER recruitment to an adjacent estrogen response element ( ERE ) in the BIRC3 promoter .	
22083956_s4	This effect is accompanied by a major increase in NF-ÎºB-dependent histone acetylation around the ERE .	
22083956_s5	Interestingly , CBP , a histone acetyltransferase previously implicated in repressive interactions between ER and NF-ÎºB , plays a permissive role by promoting histone acetylation and ER recruitment , as well as enhanced expression of BIRC3 .	
22083956_s6	These findings suggest a new gene regulatory mechanism by which inflammation and NF-ÎºB activation can influence ER recruitment to inherently inactive ER binding sites .	sustaining proliferative signaling,tumor promoting inflammation
22083956_s7	This fine-tuning mechanism may explain how two factors that generally repress each other's activity may work together on certain genes to promote breast cancer cell survival and tumor progression .	
22093616_s0	We present a novel gain-of-function mutation of TGF-Î² receptor II ( TÎ²RII ) found in human oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
22093616_s1	Expression of E221V/N238I mutant TÎ²RII enhanced TGF-Î² signaling .	
22093616_s2	Mutation of TÎ²RII conferred cells higher migratory and invasive capabilities and MMP-2 activity .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
22093616_s3	In mouse tumor model , mutant tumors exhibited poor differentiation and E-cadherin relocalization to the cytosol .	
22093616_s4	Lipid-raft-dependent endocytosis of TÎ²RII was attenuated in mutant TÎ²RII , suggesting that enhancement of TGF-Î² signaling by this mutation is due to delayed TÎ²RII internalization .	
22093616_s5	Taken together , our results show a novel gain-of-function TÎ²RII mutation , which enhances TGF-Î² signaling leading to more invasive phenotypic changes in human OSCC .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
22108827_s0	Androgen deprivation is currently a standard-of-care , first-line therapy for prostate cancer in the United States .	
22108827_s1	Although this regimen effectively regresses androgen-dependent disease , relapse often occurs in an androgen-independent manner and is associated with poor prognosis .	
22108827_s2	Such castration-resistant prostate cancer represents a major clinical challenge , and the mechanisms underlying castration resistance are not fully understood .	
22108827_s3	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a key developmental process and has also been implicated in cancer metastasis and therapeutic resistance in recent years .	
22108827_s4	However , the factors contributing to EMT in human cancers remain unclear .	
22108827_s5	Here , we show that both normal mouse prostate tissue and human LuCaP35 prostate tumor explants display an EMT as well as increased stem cell-like features following androgen deprivation .	activating invasion and metastasis
22108827_s6	Importantly , we observed similar changes in mesenchymal features in prostate tumors from patients treated with androgen-deprivation therapy .	
22108827_s7	In addition , we have delineated a feedback loop involving the androgen receptor and the Zeb1 transcription factor that seems to mediate this transition .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22108827_s8	In summary , we show for the first time that androgen deprivation induces EMT in both normal prostate and prostate cancer , revealing a potentially important consequence of a standard-of-care treatment for prostate cancer .	
22108827_s9	This finding could have significant implications for second-line treatment strategies in this clinical setting .	
22120717_s0	P53 has an important role in the processing of starvation signals .	
22120717_s1	P53-dependent molecular mediators of the Warburg effect reduce glucose consumption and promote mitochondrial function .	
22120717_s2	We therefore hypothesized that the retention of wild-type p53 characteristic of primary glioblastomas limits metabolic demands induced by deregulated signal transduction in the presence of hypoxia and nutrient depletion .	
22120717_s3	Here we report that short hairpin RNA-mediated gene suppression of wild-type p53 or ectopic expression of mutant temperature-sensitive dominant-negative p53(V135A) increased glucose consumption and lactate production , decreased oxygen consumption and enhanced hypoxia-induced cell death in p53 wild-type human glioblastoma cells .	cellular energetics
22120717_s4	Similarly , genetic knockout of p53 in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells resulted in reduced respiration and hypersensitivity towards hypoxia-induced cell death .	
22120717_s5	Further , wild-type p53 gene silencing reduced the expression of synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 ( SCO2 ) , an effector necessary for respiratory chain function .	
22120717_s6	An SCO2 transgene reverted the metabolic phenotype and restored resistance towards hypoxia in p53-depleted and p53 mutant glioma cells in a rotenone-sensitive manner , demonstrating that this effect was dependent on intact oxidative phosphorylation .	
22120717_s7	Supplementation with methyl-pyruvate , a mitochondrial substrate , rescued p53 wild-type but not p53 mutant cells from hypoxic cell death , demonstrating a p53-mediated selective aptitude to metabolize mitochondrial substrates .	
22120717_s8	Further , SCO2 gene silencing in p53 wild-type glioma cells sensitized these cells towards hypoxia .	
22120717_s9	Finally , lentiviral gene suppression of SCO2 significantly enhanced tumor necrosis in a subcutaneous HCT116 xenograft tumor model , compatible with impaired energy metabolism in these cells .	cellular energetics
22120717_s10	These findings demonstrate that glioma and colon cancer cells with p53 wild-type status can skew the Warburg effect and thereby reduce their vulnerability towards tumor hypoxia in an SCO2-dependent manner .	cellular energetics
22120717_s11	Targeting SCO2 may therefore represent a valuable strategy to enhance sensitivity towards hypoxia and may complement strategies targeting glucose metabolism .	cellular energetics
22123295_s0	The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor .	
22123295_s1	Recent studies have reported the anti-tumor effects of the AhR in breast cancer .	
22123295_s2	In this study , we investigated the anti-tumor effect of AhR activation based on the cancer stem cell hypothesis .	
22123295_s3	We show that AhR activation suppressed mammosphere formation of MCF-7 cells and decreased the proportion of cells with high ALDH-1 ( aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 ) activity .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22123295_s4	In addition , we also demonstrate that AhR activation regulates self-renewal signaling by down-regulating Wnt/Î²-catenin and Notch .	
22123926_s0	In cancer cells , the aberrant conversion of pyruvate into lactate instead of acetyl-CoA in the presence of oxygen is known as the Warburg effect .	
22123926_s1	The consequences and mechanisms of this metabolic peculiarity are incompletely understood .	
22123926_s2	Here we report that p53 status is a key determinant of the Warburg effect .	cellular energetics
22123926_s3	Wild-type p53 expression decreased levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-2 ( Pdk2 ) and the product of its activity , the inactive form of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( P-Pdc ) , both of which are key regulators of pyruvate metabolism .	
22123926_s4	Decreased levels of Pdk2 and P-Pdc in turn promoted conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA instead of lactate .	
22123926_s5	Thus , wild-type p53 limited lactate production in cancer cells unless Pdk2 could be elevated .	
22123926_s6	Together , our results established that wild-type p53 prevents manifestation of the Warburg effect by controlling Pdk2 .	cellular energetics
22123926_s7	These findings elucidate a new mechanism by which p53 suppresses tumorigenesis acting at the level of cancer cell metabolism .	
22134754_s0	Histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi ) are promising epigenetic cancer chemotherapeutics rapidly approaching clinical use .	
22134754_s1	In this study , we tested using in vitro and in vivo models the differential biological effects of a novel HDAC inhibitor [ belinostat ( PXD101) ] , in a wide panel of androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent tumor cells .	
22134754_s2	Belinostat significantly increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 .	
22134754_s3	Belinostat potently inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cell lines ( IC50 range from 0.5 to 2.5 ï¿½M ) with cytotoxic activity preferentially against tumor cells .	
22134754_s4	This agent induced G2/M arrest and increased significantly the percentage of apoptosis mainly in androgen-sensitive tumor cells confirming its growth-inhibitory effects .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22134754_s5	The cell death mechanisms were studied in three different prostate cancer cell lines with different androgen dependence and expression of androgen receptor ; LAPC-4 and 22rv1 ( androgen-dependent and expressing androgen receptor ) and PC3 ( androgen-independent not expressing androgen receptor ) .	
22134754_s6	Belinostat induced the expression of p21 and p27 , acetylation of p53 and G2/M arrest associated with Bcl2 and Bcl-Xl downmodulation and significant reduction of survivin , IAPs and Akt/pAkt and increased caspase-8 and -9 expression/activity .	
22134754_s7	Belinostat effectiveness was dependent on the androgen receptor ( AR ) , since the stable transfection of AR greatly increased the efficacy of this HDAC inhibitor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22134754_s8	These observations were correlated using in vivo models .	
22134754_s9	We demonstrated that belinostat preferentially resulted in antitumor effect in androgen-dependent tumor cells expressing AR .	
22134754_s10	Our findings provide evidence that belinostat may be a promising anticancer drug for prostate cancer expressing AR , supporting its clinical role in prostate cancer .	
22150625_s0	OBJECTIVE The HER2 receptor is involved in pathways essential for cell proliferation , and is an important predictive and prognostic factor in breast cancer .	
22150625_s1	HER2 probably plays a critical role in many types of cancer , including urothelial carcinoma of the bladder ( UCB ) .	
22150625_s2	Stage T1 UCB exhibits heterogeneous clinical behaviour , and the frequency of HER2 expression in such disease has not been thoroughly examined .	
22150625_s3	The aim of this study was to use an immunohistochemical technique to evaluate the frequency of HER2 expression in a defined population-based cohort of patients registered as having primary stage T1 UCB .	
22150625_s4	MATERIAL AND METHODS The initial study population comprised 285 patients registered as having primary stage T1 UCB .	
22150625_s5	The original histological specimens were re-evaluated with regard to T stage and World Health Organization grade .	
22150625_s6	Hospital records provided information on tumour size , multiplicity , possible presence of histologically proven recurrence and progression .	
22150625_s7	The patients were followed for at least 5 years or until death .	
22150625_s8	In tumours still considered stage T1 after re-evaluation , HER2 was investigated by immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded material and scored according to the guidelines used in breast cancer .	
22150625_s9	RESULTS After histopathological re-evaluation , 201 patients were still T1 UCB and could be investigated regarding HER2 expression .	
22150625_s10	HER2 overexpression was observed in 25 of those patients ( 12.4% ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22150625_s11	HER2 status was not significantly associated with recurrence or progression .	
22150625_s12	CONCLUSIONS HER2 was overexpressed in 12.4% of the present cohort of patients with primary stage T1 UCB .	
22150625_s13	There was no significant association between tumour HER2 status and prognosis .	
22159410_s0	The aim of the present study was to investigate the apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cell lines , A2780 and CP70 , induced by a novel curcumin analogue , B19 .	
22159410_s1	The proliferation of cells was detected with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) assay and apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry .	
22159410_s2	Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) were assessed by the fluorescent indicator DCF-DA .	
22159410_s3	The protein expression of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress pathways , GRP78 , XBP-1 , ATF-4 and CHOP , was examined with Western blotting .	
22159410_s4	A growth inhibitory effect was observed after treatment with B19 in a dose-dependent manner and with more potential than curcumin .	
22159410_s5	At 20 ï¿½M , B19 induced significant apoptosis in CP70 cells .	resisting cell death
22159410_s6	Furthermore , B19 induced the ER stress response , while curcumin had no effect on ER stress .	
22159410_s7	These results suggest that B19 has more effective antitumor properties than curcumin , and is associated with the activation of ER stress and ROS in ovarian cancer cells .	
22161874_s0	Human carcinomas are defined by recurrent chromosomal aneuploidies , which result in a tissue-specific distribution of genomic imbalances .	
22161874_s1	In order to develop models for these genome mutations and to determine their role in tumorigenesis , we generated 45 spontaneously transformed murine cell lines from normal epithelial cells derived from bladder , cervix , colon , kidney , lung , and mammary gland .	
22161874_s2	Phenotypic changes , chromosomal aberrations , centrosome number , and telomerase activity were assayed in control uncultured cells and in three subsequent stages of transformation .	
22161874_s3	Supernumerary centrosomes , binucleate cells , and tetraploidy were observed as early as 48 hr after explantation .	
22161874_s4	In addition , telomerase activity increased throughout progression .	
22161874_s5	Live-cell imaging revealed that failure of cytokinesis , not cell fusion , promoted genome duplication .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
22161874_s6	Spectral karyotyping demonstrated that aneuploidy preceded immortalization , consisting predominantly of whole chromosome losses ( 4 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and Y ) and gains ( 1 , 10 , 15 , and 19 ) .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
22161874_s7	After transformation , focal amplifications of the oncogenes Myc and Mdm2 were frequently detected .	
22161874_s8	Fifty percent of the transformed lines resulted in tumors on injection into immunocompromised mice .	
22161874_s9	The phenotypic and genomic alterations observed in spontaneously transformed murine epithelial cells recapitulated the aberration pattern observed during human carcinogenesis .	
22161874_s10	The dominant aberration of these cell lines was the presence of specific chromosomal aneuploidies .	genomic instability and mutation
22161874_s11	We propose that our newly derived cancer models will be useful tools to dissect the sequential steps of genome mutations during malignant transformation , and also to identify cancer-specific genes , signaling pathways , and the role of chromosomal instability in this process .	genomic instability and mutation
22170031_s0	Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR-TKIs ) show dramatic antitumor activity in a subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have an active mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene .	
22170031_s1	On the other hand , some lung cancer patients with wild type EGFR also respond to EGFR-TKIs , suggesting that EGFR-TKIs have an effect on host cells as well as tumor cells .	
22170031_s2	However , the effect of EGFR-TKIs on host microenvironments is largely unknown .	
22170031_s3	A multiple organ metastasis model was previously established in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice using human lung cancer cells .	
22170031_s4	This model was used to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of erlotinib , an EGFR-TKI , on multiple organ metastases induced by human small cell lung cancer cells ( SBC-5 cells ) that did not express EGFR .	
22170031_s5	Although erlotinib did not have any effect on the proliferation of SBC-5 cells in vitro , it significantly suppressed bone and lung metastases in vivo , but not liver metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
22170031_s6	An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that , erlotinib significantly suppressed the number of osteoclasts in bone metastases , whereas no difference was seen in microvessel density .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
22170031_s7	Moreover , erlotinib inhibited EGF-induced receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B expression in an osteoblastic cell line ( MC3T3-E1 cells ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22170031_s8	These results strongly suggested that erlotinib prevented bone metastases by affecting host microenvironments irrespective of its direct effect on tumor cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22179576_s0	Heat shock protein 27 ( Hsp27 ) is emerging as a promising therapeutic target for treatment of various cancers .	
22179576_s1	Although the role of Hsp27 in protection from stress-induced intrinsic cell death has been relatively well studied , its role in Fas ( death domain containing member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily)-induced apoptosis and cell proliferation remains underappreciated .	
22179576_s2	Here , we show that Hsp27 silencing induces dual coordinated effects , resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation and sensitization of cells to Fas-induced apoptosis through regulation of PEA-15 ( 15-kDa phospho-enriched protein in astrocytes ) .	
22179576_s3	We demonstrate that Hsp27 silencing suppresses proliferation by causing PEA-15 to bind and sequester extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) , resulting in reduced translocation of ERK to the nucleus .	
22179576_s4	Concurrently , Hsp27 silencing promotes Fas-induced apoptosis by inducing PEA-15 to release Fas-associating protein with a novel death domain ( FADD ) , thus allowing FADD to participate in death receptor signaling .	resisting cell death
22179576_s5	Conversely , Hsp27 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and suppresses Fas-induced apoptosis .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22179576_s6	Furthermore , we show that Hsp27 regulation of PEA-15 activity occurs in an Akt-dependent manner .	
22179576_s7	Significantly , Hsp27 silencing in a panel of phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 ( PTEN ) wild-type or null cell lines , and in LNCaP cells that inducibly express PTEN , resulted in selective growth inhibition of PTEN-deficient cancer cells .	
22179576_s8	These data identify a dual coordinated role of Hsp27 in cell proliferation and Fas-induced apoptosis via Akt and PEA-15 , and indicate that improved clinical responses to Hsp27-targeted therapy may be achieved by stratifying patient populations based on tumor PTEN expression .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22189713_s0	A distinct group of breast cancers , called " basal " or " triple-negative " ( TN ) cancers express both basal cytokeratins and the epidermal growth factor receptor , but fail to express estrogen receptors , progesterone receptors or HER2 and have stem-like or mesenchymal features .	
22189713_s1	They are particularly aggressive , are frequently chemo-resistant , with p53 mutation , up-regulation of IL-6 and Stat3 .	
22189713_s2	Because TN cells are particularly sensitive to the anti-diabetic agent metformin , we hypothesized that it may target JAK2/Stat3 signaling .	
22189713_s3	The effects of metformin upon Stat3 expression and activation were examined in four human TN cell lines .	
22189713_s4	Metformin's effects were also studied in sublines with forced over-expression of constitutively active ( CA ) Stat3 , as well as lines with stable knockdown of Stat3 .	
22189713_s5	Metformin inhibited Stat3 activation ( P-Stat3 ) at Tyr705 and Ser727 and downstream signaling in each of the four parental cell lines .	
22189713_s6	CA-Stat3 transfection attenuated , whereas Stat3 knockdown enhanced , the effects of metformin upon growth inhibition and apoptosis induction .	resisting cell death
22189713_s7	A Stat3 specific inhibitor acted synergistically with metformin in reducing cell growth and inducing apoptosis .	resisting cell death
22189713_s8	An mTOR inhibitor showed no significant interaction with metformin .	
22189713_s9	In summary , Stat3 is a critical regulator of metformin action in TN cancer cells , providing the potential for enhancing metformin's efficacy in the clinical setting .	
22201685_s0	The innate immune response involves a variety of inflammatory reactions that can result in inflammatory disease and cancer if they are not resolved and instead are allowed to persist .	
22201685_s1	The effective activation and resolution of innate immune responses relies on the production and posttranscriptional regulation of mRNAs encoding inflammatory effector proteins .	
22201685_s2	The RNA-binding protein HuR binds to and regulates such mRNAs , but its exact role in inflammation remains unclear .	
22201685_s3	Here we show that HuR maintains inflammatory homeostasis by controlling macrophage plasticity and migration .	tumor promoting inflammation
22201685_s4	Mice lacking HuR in myeloid-lineage cells , which include many of the cells of the innate immune system , displayed enhanced sensitivity to endotoxemia , rapid progression of chemical-induced colitis , and severe susceptibility to colitis-associated cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
22201685_s5	The myeloid cell-specific HuR-deficient mice had an exacerbated inflammatory cytokine profile and showed enhanced CCR2-mediated macrophage chemotaxis .	tumor promoting inflammation
22201685_s6	At the molecular level , activated macrophages from these mice showed enhancements in the use of inflammatory mRNAs ( including Tnf , Tgfb , Il10 , Ccr2 , and Ccl2 ) due to a lack of inhibitory effects on their inducible translation and/or stability .	tumor promoting inflammation
22201685_s7	Conversely , myeloid overexpression of HuR induced posttranscriptional silencing , reduced inflammatory profiles , and protected mice from colitis and cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
22201685_s8	Our results highlight the role of HuR as a homeostatic coordinator of mRNAs that encode molecules that guide innate inflammatory effects and demonstrate the potential of harnessing the effects of HuR for clinical benefit against pathologic inflammation and cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
22209867_s0	Hormone-dependent estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancers generally respond well to anti-estrogen therapy .	
22209867_s1	Unfortunately , hormone-independent estrogen receptor negative ( ER- ) breast cancers are aggressive , respond poorly to current treatments and have a poor prognosis .	
22209867_s2	New approaches and targets are needed for the prevention and treatment of ER- breast cancer .	
22209867_s3	The NF-ÎºB signaling pathway is strongly implicated in ER- tumor genesis , constituting a possible target for treatment .	
22209867_s4	Hydrogen sulfide-releasing aspirin ( HS-ASA ) , a novel and safer derivative of aspirin , has shown promise as an anti-cancer agent .	
22209867_s5	We examined the growth inhibitory effect of HS-ASA via alterations in cell proliferation , cell cycle phase transitions , and apoptosis , using MDA-MB-231 cells as a model of triple negative breast cancer .	
22209867_s6	Tumor xenografts in mice , representing human ER- breast cancer , were evaluated for reduction in tumor size , followed by immunohistochemical analysis for proliferation , apoptosis and expression of NF-ÎºB .	
22209867_s7	HS-ASA suppressed the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells by induction of G(0)/G(1) arrest and apoptosis , down-regulation of NF-ÎºB , reduction of thioredoxin reductase activity , and increased levels reactive oxygen species .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling,tumor promoting inflammation
22209867_s8	Tumor xenografts in mice , were significantly reduced in volume and mass by HS-ASA treatment .	
22209867_s9	The decrease in tumor mass was associated with inhibition of cell proliferation , induction of apoptosis and decrease in NF-ÎºB levels in vivo .	
22209867_s10	HS-ASA has anti-cancer potential against ER- breast cancer and merits further study .	
22213475_s0	Transcriptional coactivator amplified in breast cancer 1 ( AIB1 ) plays important roles in the progression of several cancers such as prostate cancer , breast cancer , and hepatocellular carcinoma .	
22213475_s1	However , its role in cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) , a chemoresistant bile duct carcinoma with a poor prognosis , remains unclear .	
22213475_s2	In this study we found that AIB1 protein was frequently overexpressed in human CCA specimens and CCA cell lines .	
22213475_s3	Down-regulation of AIB1 induced the G2/M arrest and decreased the expression of mitosis-promoting factors including Cyclin A , Cyclin B , and Cdk1 through suppressing the Akt pathway , which resulted in inhibiting CCA cell proliferation .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
22213475_s4	In addition , AIB1 enhanced the chemoresistance of CCA cells at least in part through up-regulating the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 .	resisting cell death
22213475_s5	AIB1 regulated the expression of Bcl-2 in CCA cells through activating the Akt pathway as well as suppressing intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .	resisting cell death
22213475_s6	AIB1 suppressed ROS by up-regulating antioxidants such as glutathione synthetase and glutathione peroxidase , which are targets of the NF-E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) , a critical transcription factor that regulates antioxidants , detoxification enzymes , and drug efflux proteins .	tumor promoting inflammation
22213475_s7	AIB1 also increased the expression of another two Nrf2 targets , ABCC2 and ABCG2 , to enhance drug efflux .	
22213475_s8	AIB1 served as an essential coactivator for Nrf2 activation by physically interacting with Nrf2 to enhance its transcriptional activity .	
22213475_s9	Conclusion : AIB1 plays an important role in proliferation and chemoresistance of CCA through simultaneous activation of Akt and Nrf2 pathways , suggesting that AIB1 is a potential molecular target for CCA treatment .	
22237206_s0	The DNA damage response ( DDR ) cascade and ROS ( reactive oxygen species ) signaling are both involved in the induction of cell death after DNA damage , but a mechanistic link between these two pathways has not been clearly elucidated .	
22237206_s1	This study demonstrates that ROS induction after treatment of cells with neocarzinostatin ( NCS ) , an ionizing radiation mimetic , is at least partly mediated by increasing histone H2AX .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
22237206_s2	Increased levels of ROS and cell death induced by H2AX overexpression alone or DNA damage leading to H2AX accumulation are reduced by treating cells with the antioxidant N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine ( NAC ) , the NADP(H) oxidase ( Nox ) inhibitor DPI , expression of Rac1N17 , and knockdown of Nox1 , but not Nox4 , indicating that induction of ROS by H2AX is mediated through Nox1 and Rac1 GTPase .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
22237206_s3	H2AX increases Nox1 activity partly by reducing the interaction between a Nox1 activator NOXA1 and its inhibitor 14-3-3zeta .	genomic instability and mutation
22237206_s4	These results point to a novel role of histone H2AX that regulates Nox1-mediated ROS generation after DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
22249246_s0	DNA repair is essential in maintaining genome integrity and defects in different steps of the process have been linked to cancer and aging .	
22249246_s1	It is a long lasting question how DNA repair is spatially and temporarily organized in the highly compartmentalized nucleus and whether the diverse nuclear compartments regulate differently the efficiency of repair .	
22249246_s2	Increasing evidence suggest the involvement of nuclear pore complexes in repair of double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in yeast .	
22249246_s3	Here , we show that the human nucleoporin 153 ( NUP153 ) has a role in repair of DSBs and in the activation of DNA damage checkpoints .	genomic instability and mutation
22249246_s4	We explore the mechanism of action of NUP153 and we propose its potential as a novel therapeutic target in cancers .	
22251703_s0	Imiquimod is a synthetic compound with antitumor properties ; a 5% cream formulation is successfully used to treat skin tumors .	
22251703_s1	The antitumor effect of imiquimod is multifactorial , although its ability to modulate immune responses by triggering TLR7/8 is thought to be key .	
22251703_s2	Among the immune cells suggested to be involved are plasmacytoid DCs ( pDCs ) .	
22251703_s3	However , a direct contribution of pDCs to tumor killing in vivo and the mechanism of their recruitment to imiquimod-treated sites have never been demonstrated .	
22251703_s4	Using a mouse model of melanoma , we have now demonstrated that pDCs can directly clear tumors without the need for the adaptive immune system .	tumor promoting inflammation
22251703_s5	Topical imiquimod treatment led to TLR7-dependent and IFN-Î±/Î² receptor 1-dependent ( IFNAR1-dependent ) upregulation of expression of the chemokine CCL2 in mast cells .	
22251703_s6	This was essential to induce skin inflammation and for the recruitment of pDCs to the skin .	tumor promoting inflammation
22251703_s7	The recruited pDCs were CD8Î±+ and induced tumor regression in a TLR7/MyD88- and IFNAR1-dependent manner .	
22251703_s8	Lack of TLR7 and IFNAR1 or depletion of pDCs or CD8Î±+ cells from tumor-bearing mice completely abolished the effect of imiquimod .	
22251703_s9	TLR7 was essential for imiquimod-stimulated pDCs to produce IFN-Î±/Î² , which led to TRAIL and granzyme B secretion by pDCs via IFNAR1 signaling .	
22251703_s10	Blocking these cytolytic molecules impaired pDC-mediated tumor killing .	
22251703_s11	Our results demonstrate that imiquimod treatment leads to CCL2-dependent recruitment of pDCs and their transformation into a subset of killer DCs able to directly eliminate tumor cells .	
22264502_s0	OBJECTIVE : Emerging evidences implicate long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) are deregulated in cancer development .	
22264502_s1	The purpose of the current study is to investigate the role of new lncRNA , named PlncRNA-1 , in prostate cancer ( CaP ) pathogenesis .	
22264502_s2	MATERIALS AND METHODS : In this study , real-time q-PCR was used to demonstrate the expression of PlncRNA-1 in 16 pairs CaP tissues and matched normal tissues , 14 pairs CaP tissues and BPH tissues , 4 CaP cell lines , including LNCaP , LNCaP-AI , PC3 , and C4-2 , and 2 normal prostate epithelial cell lines RWPE-1 and PWR-1E .	
22264502_s3	After PlncRNA-1 was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines , cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using CCK-8 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) .	
22264502_s4	After PlncRNA-1 and AR was suppressed by siRNA in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell lines , real-time q-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure reciprocal regulation of PlncRNA-1 and AR .	
22264502_s5	RESULTS : We showed that expression PlncRNA-1 , was significantly higher in CaP cells relative to normal prostate epithelial cells , as well as higher in human CaPs compared with normal tissues and benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) .	
22264502_s6	Silencing of PlncRNA-1 significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in CaP cell lines LNCaP and LNCaP-AI .	resisting cell death
22264502_s7	Mechanistically , PlncRNA-1 suppression by siRNA resulted in a decrease of androgen receptor ( AR ) mRNA , protein and AR downstream target .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22264502_s8	Of note , blockade of AR signaling with siRNA also resulted in a suppression of PlncRNA-1 expression in CaP cell lines .	
22264502_s9	CONCLUSIONS : Our study suggests reciprocal regulation of PlncRNA-1 and androgen receptor contribute to CaP pathogenesis and that PlncRNA-1 is a potential therapy target .	
22264786_s0	The ATM kinase and p53 are key tumor suppressor factors that control the genotoxic stress response pathway .	
22264786_s1	The ATM substrate Mdm2 controls p53 activity by either targeting p53 for degradation or promoting its synthesis by binding the p53 mRNA .	
22264786_s2	The physiological role and regulation of Mdm2's dual function toward p53 is not known .	
22264786_s3	Here we show that ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser395 is required for the p53 mRNA-Mdm2 interaction .	
22264786_s4	This event also promotes SUMO-conjugation of Mdm2 and its nucleoli accumulation .	
22264786_s5	Interfering with the p53 mRNA-Mdm2 interaction prevents p53 stabilization and activation following DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
22264786_s6	These results demonstrate how ATM activity switches Mdm2 from a negative to a positive regulator of p53 via the p53 mRNA .	
22266866_s0	The Ras association domain family 1 isoform A ( RASSF1A ) is a tumor suppressor whose inactivation is implicated in the development of many human cancers , including breast carcinomas .	
22266866_s1	Little is known about the tumor-suppressive function of RASSF1A in breast tissue and whether its inactivation is mechanistically involved in the initiation and progression of breast tumors .	
22266866_s2	Here , we show that RASSF1A inhibits breast cancer growth in vivo , and suppresses estrogen receptor ( ERÎ± ) expression and function .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22266866_s3	Reconstitution of RASSF1A in MCF7 cells led to decreased ERÎ± levels and reduced sensitivity to estrogen ( E2 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22266866_s4	Concomitantly , we observed decreased expression of Id1 as well as the E2-responsive genes Bcl-2 and c-Myc that cooperatively contribute to the immortalization and transformation of breast epithelial cells .	enabling replicative immortality
22266866_s5	This downregulation was associated with induction of cell-cycle arrest and senescence that constitute early barriers to cancer initiation and progression .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
22266866_s6	Knockdown of ERÎ± showed that downregulation of ERÎ± suffices to increase senescence and inhibit expression of Bcl-2 , c-Myc and Id1 .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
22266866_s7	However , enforced expression of ERÎ± only partially rescued RASSF1A-mediated growth inhibition and senescence , suggesting that suppression of ERÎ± expression and activity is not the only mechanism by which RASSF1A inhibits growth and survival of breast cancer cells .	enabling replicative immortality
22266866_s8	Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 , c-Myc and Id1 had little or no effect on RASSF1A-mediated growth arrest , indicating that RASSF1A acts dominantly over these oncogenes .	
22266866_s9	Mechanistically , RASSF1A was found to suppress ERÎ± expression through Akt1 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22266866_s10	It also transiently inhibited ERÎ±-induced Ras-MAPK activity after exposure of cells to E2 .	
22266866_s11	Together , our data show that RASSF1A acts as a tumor suppressor in ERÎ±+ mammary epithelial cells , in part through inhibiting ERÎ± expression and activity .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22266866_s12	These findings suggest that RASSF1A has a key role in suppressing the transformation of human breast epithelial cells and ERÎ±+ breast cancer initiation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22272768_s0	Curcumin ( CUR ; diferuloylmethane ) , a rhizome extract of Curcuma Longa L. is commonly used as a food coloring and flavoring agent .	
22272768_s1	Although oriental and Ayurvedic medicines have traditionally used CUR in the treatment of diseases , conventional medicine has just begun to recognize its potential therapeutic value .	
22272768_s2	Numerous recent studies have demonstrated the ability of CUR to halt or prevent certain types of cancer , decrease inflammation , and improve cardiovascular health .	
22272768_s3	However , very few studies have examined its ability to protect against drug-induced organ injury .	
22272768_s4	This study explored whether CUR pre-exposure has the potential to prevent acetaminophen ( APAP)-induced : ( i ) hepatotoxicity , ( ii ) genomic injury , ( iii ) oxidative stress in the liver , and ( iv ) apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths in the liver in vivo .	
22272768_s5	Additional goals were to investigate the interplay of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes and their ultimate impact on various forms of cell death .	
22272768_s6	In order to study the CUR-APAP interaction , male B6C3F1 mice were gavaged with CUR ( 17 mg/kg/day , p.o. ) for 12 days followed by a single APAP exposure ( 400 mg/kg , ip ) .	
22272768_s7	Four groups of animals ( control , CUR , APAP , CUR+APAP ) were sacrificed 24 h after APAP exposure .	
22272768_s8	The results indicated that APAP-induced liver injury associated events as serum ALT ( 80-fold ) , lipid peroxidation ( 357% ) and DNA fragmentation ( 469% ) were markedly reduced to 3-fold , 134% and 162% , respectively , in the CUR+APAP group .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
22272768_s9	The APAP-induced increase in expression of pro-apoptotic genes ( Bax , caspase-3 ) decreased while expression of anti-apoptotic genes ( Bcl-XL ) increased in CUR preexposed mouse livers , and these changes were mirrored in the pattern of apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths .	resisting cell death
22272768_s10	Levels of DNA damage sensor PâµÂ³ and its counterpart Mdm2 were also analyzed during this interaction .	
22272768_s11	Based on the available literature , and these results , it seems likely that CUR may impart global protection in vivo against drug-induced liver injury by opposing several crucial events instrumental to both apoptosis and necrosis .	resisting cell death
22276155_s0	It is prevailingly thought that the antiestrogens tamoxifen and ICI 182 , 780 are competitive antagonists of the estrogen-binding site of the estrogen receptor-alpha ( ER-Î± ) .	
22276155_s1	However , a plethora of evidence demonstrated both antiestrogens exhibit agonist activities in different systems such as activation of the membrane-initiated signaling pathways .	
22276155_s2	The mechanisms by which antiestrogens mediate estrogen-like activities have not been fully established .	
22276155_s3	Previously , a variant of ER-Î± , EP-Î±36 , has been cloned and showed to mediate membrane-initiated estrogen and antiestrogen signaling in cells only expressing ER-Î±36 .	
22276155_s4	Here , we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiestrogen signaling in ER-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells that express high levels of endogenous ER-Î±36 .	
22276155_s5	We found that the effects of both 4-hydoxytamoxifen ( 4-OHT ) and ICI 182 , 780 ( ICI ) exhibited a non-monotonic , or biphasic dose response curve ; antiestrogens at low concentrations , elicited a mitogenic signaling pathway to stimulate cell proliferation while at high concentrations , antiestrogens inhibited cell growth .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22276155_s6	Antiestrogens at l nM induced the phosphorylation of the Src-Y416 residue , an event to activate Src , while at 5 ï¿½M induced Src-Y527 phosphorylation that inactivates Src .	
22276155_s7	Antiestrogens at 1 nM also induced phosphorylation of the MAPK/ERK and activated the Cyclin D1 promoter activity through the Src/EGFR/STAT5 pathways but not at 5 ï¿½M .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22276155_s8	Knock-down of ER-Î±36 abrogated the biphasic antiestrogen signaling in these cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22276155_s9	Our results thus indicated that ER-Î±36 mediates biphasic antiestrogen signaling in the ER-negative breast cancer cells and Src functions as a switch of antiestrogen signaling dependent on concentrations of antiestrogens through the EGFR/STAT5 pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22277962_s0	The published results on nanoparticles cytotoxicity and genotoxicity such as titanium dioxide nanoparticles ( TiO(2) NPs ) are inconsistent , and often conflicting and insufficient .	
22277962_s1	Since different parameters may have impact on the toxicity results , there is need to lay stress on detailed characterization of NPs and the use of different testing conditions for assessment of NPs toxicity .	
22277962_s2	In order to investigate whether dispersion procedures influence NP cytotoxicity and genotoxicity , we compared two protocols giving TiO(2) NP dispersions with different stability and agglomeration states .	
22277962_s3	Detailed primary and secondary characteristics of both TiO(2) NP dispersions in culture media were carried out before toxicological testing ; TK6 human lymphoblast cells , EUE human embryonic epithelial cells and Cos-1 monkey kidney fibroblasts were used to assess cytotoxicity ( by trypan blue exclusion , proliferation activity and plating efficiency assays ) and genotoxicity ( by the comet assay ) .	
22277962_s4	DNA strand breaks were detected by the alkaline comet assay .	
22277962_s5	DNA oxidation lesions ( especially 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine , 8-oxoG ) were measured with a modified comet assay including incubation with specific repair enzyme formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase ( FPG ) .	
22277962_s6	The TiO(2) NPs dispersion with large agglomerates ( 3 min sonication and no serum in stock solution ) induced DNA damage in all three cell lines , while the TiO(2) NPs dispersed with agglomerates less than 200 nm ( foetal serum in stock solution and sonication 15 min ) had no effect on genotoxicity .	genomic instability and mutation
22277962_s7	An increased level of DNA oxidation lesions detected in Cos-1 and TK6 cells indicates that the leading mechanism by which TiO(2) NPs trigger genotoxicity is most likely oxidative stress .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
22277962_s8	Our results show that the dispersion method used can influence the results of toxicity studies .	
22277962_s9	Therefore at least two different dispersion procedures should be incorporated into assessment of cyto- and genotoxic effects of NPs .	
22277962_s10	It is important , when assessing the hazard associated with NPs , to establish standard testing procedures and thorough strategies to consider the diverse conditions relevant to possible exposures .	
22301190_s0	p53 is a well-known transcription factor that controls cell cycle arrest and cell death in response to a wide range of stresses .	
22301190_s1	Moreover , p53 regulates glucose metabolism and its mutation results in the metabolic switch to the Warburg effect found in cancer cells .	
22301190_s2	Nucleotide biosynthesis is also critical for cell proliferation and the cell division cycle .	
22301190_s3	Nonetheless , little is known about whether p53 regulates nucleotide biosynthesis .	
22301190_s4	Here we demonstrated that p53-inducible microRNA-34a ( miR-34a ) repressed inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) , a rate-limiting enzyme of de novo GTP biosynthesis .	
22301190_s5	Treatment with anti-miR-34a inhibitor relieved the expression of IMPDH upon DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
22301190_s6	Ultimately , miR-34a-mediated inhibition of IMPDH resulted in repressed activation of the GTP-dependent Ras signaling pathway .	
22301190_s7	In summary , we suggest that p53 has a novel function in regulating purine biosynthesis , aided by miR-34a-dependent IMPDH repression .	
22307313_s0	Various endocrine disrupting chemicals ( EDCs ) are exogenous compounds found in the environment and have the potential to interfere with the endocrine system and hormonal regulation .	
22307313_s1	Among EDCs , bisphenolA ( BPA ) and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenol)-ethane [ methoxychlor ( MXC) ] have estrogenic activity resulting in a variety of dysfunctions in the E2-mediated response by binding to estrogen receptors ( ERs ) , causing human health problems such as abnormal reproduction and carcinogenesis .	
22307313_s2	In this study , we investigated the effects of BPA and MXC on cell proliferation facilitated by ER signaling in human breast cancer cells .	
22307313_s3	MCF-7 cells are known to be ERÎ±-positive and to be a highly E2-responsive cancer cell line ; these cells are , therefore , a useful invitro model for detecting estrogenic activity in response to EDCs .	
22307313_s4	We evaluated cancer cell proliferation following BPA and MXC treatment using an MTT assay .	
22307313_s5	We analyzed alterations in the expression of genes associated with the cell cycle in MCF-7 cells by semi-quantitative reverse-transcription PCR following treatment with BPA or MXC compared to EtOH .	
22307313_s6	To determine whether BPA and MXC stimulate cancer cell growth though ER signaling , we co-treated the cells with agonists ( propyl pyrazoletriol , PPT ; and diarylpropionitrile , DPN ) or an antagonist ( ICI 182,780 ) of ER signaling and reduced ERÎ± gene expression via siRNA in MCF-7 cells before treatment with EDCs .	
22307313_s7	These studies confirmed the carcinogenicity of EDCs invitro .	
22307313_s8	As a result , BPA and MXC induced the cancer cell proliferation by the upregulation of genes that promote the cell cycle and the downregulation of anti-proliferative genes , especially ones affecting the G1/S transition via ERÎ± signaling .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22307313_s9	These collective results confirm the carcinogenicity of these EDCs invitro .	
22307313_s10	Further studies are required to determine whether EDCs promote carcinogenesis invivo .	
22315058_s0	BACKGROUND Epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is known to be associated with chemoresistance as well as increased invasion/metastasis .	
22315058_s1	However , the relationship between EMT and resistance to an epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -targeting drug in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) remains unknown .	
22315058_s2	In this study , we investigated the acquisition of EMT by gefitinib in HNSCC cell line ( UMSCC81B ) .	
22315058_s3	METHODS We isolated fibroblastoid variant ( 81B-Fb ) from gefitinib-resistant UMSCC81B-GR3 cells obtained after increasing the doses of gefitinib treatment in vitro and examined EMT and its underlying mechanism .	
22315058_s4	RESULT 81B-Fb cells exhibited fibroblast-like morphology , increased motility , loss of E-cadherin , acquisition of vimentin and snail expression .	
22315058_s5	In 81B-Fb cells , downregulation of EGFR , which is mediated by increased ubiquitination , and activation of downstream protein kinase B ( Akt ) , glycogen synthase kinase-beta ( GSK-3Î² ) signalling and upregulation of snail expression were observed compared with UMSCC81B cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22315058_s6	LY294002 , but not U0126 , suppressed foetal bovine serum or heregulin-Î²1-induced phosphorylation of Akt/GSK-3Î² and snail expression together with the inhibition of 81B-Fb cell motility .	
22315058_s7	Furthermore , forced expression of EGFR resulted in partial restoration of gefitinib sensitivity and reversal of EMT .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22315058_s8	CONCLUSION These results suggest that EMT in the gefitinib-resistant cells is mediated by the downregulation of EGFR and compensatory activation of Akt/GSK-3Î²/snail pathway .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22328083_s0	Vitamin D deficiency is associated with the high risk of colon cancer and a variety of other diseases .	
22328083_s1	The active vitamin D metabolite 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) ( 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) ) regulates gene transcription via its nuclear receptor ( VDR ) , and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of gene expression have also been proposed .	
22328083_s2	We have identified microRNA-22 ( miR-22 ) and several other miRNA species as 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) targets in human colon cancer cells .	
22328083_s3	Remarkably , miR-22 is induced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in a time- , dose- and VDR-dependent manner .	
22328083_s4	In SW480-ADH and HCT116 cells , miR-22 loss-of-function by transfection of a miR-22 inhibitor suppresses the antiproliferative effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) .	
22328083_s5	Additionally , miR-22 inhibition increases cell migration per se and decreases the antimigratory effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in both cell types .	activating invasion and metastasis
22328083_s6	In silico analysis shows a significant overlap between genes suppressed by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and miR-22 putative target genes .	
22328083_s7	Consistently , miR-22 inhibition abrogates the 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated suppression of NELL2 , OGN , HNRPH1 , RERE and NFAT5 genes .	
22328083_s8	In 39 out of 50 ( 78% ) human colon cancer patients , miR-22 expression was found lower in the tumour than in the matched normal tissue and correlated directly with that of VDR .	
22328083_s9	Our results indicate that miR-22 is induced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in human colon cancer cells and it may contribute to its antitumour action against this neoplasia .	
22351035_s0	Approximately 50% of human tumors have a mutation in TP53 .	
22351035_s1	The pattern and spectra of TP53 mutations often differ between cancer types , perhaps due to different etiological factors .	
22351035_s2	The Hupki ( human TP53 knock-in ) mouse embryo fibroblast ( HUF ) immortalization assay is useful for studying mutagenesis in the human TP53 gene by environmental carcinogens .	
22351035_s3	Prior to initiating an immortalization assay , carcinogen treatment conditions must be optimized , which can require a large number of cells .	
22351035_s4	As primary HUF cultures senesce within 2 weeks , restricting their use , we investigated whether immortalized HUFs retaining wild-type TP53 can be surrogates for primary HUFs in initial treatment optimization .	
22351035_s5	DNA damage by eight compounds found in diesel exhaust , benzo[a]pyrene , 3-nitrobenzanthrone , 1-nitropyrene , 1,3-dinitropyrene , 1,6-dinitropyrene , 1,8-dinitropyrene , 6-nitrochrysene , and 3-nitrofluorene , was assessed by ( 32 ) P-postlabeling and the alkaline comet assay in primary HUFs and in an immortal HUF cell line J201 .	
22351035_s6	For most compounds , higher levels of DNA adducts accumulated in J201 cells than in primary HUFs .	genomic instability and mutation
22351035_s7	This difference was not reflected in the comet assay or by cell viability changes .	
22351035_s8	Experiments in three additional immortal HUF cell lines ( AAI49 , U56 , and E2-143 ) confirmed strong differences in DNA adduct levels compared with primary HUFs .	genomic instability and mutation
22351035_s9	However , these did not correlate with the protein expression of Nqo1 or Nat1/2 , or with gene expression of Cyp1a1 or Cyp1b1 .	
22351035_s10	Our results show that using immortal HUFs as surrogates for primary HUFs in genotoxicity screening has limitations and that DNA adduct formation is the best measure of genotoxicity of the nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons tested in HUFs .	genomic instability and mutation
22354042_s0	Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis .	
22354042_s1	This phenomenon , known as the Warburg effect , is an anomalous characteristic of glucose metabolism in cancer cells .	
22354042_s2	Chronic inflammation is a key promoting factor of tumourigenesis .	
22354042_s3	It remains , however , largely unexplored whether and how pro-tumourigenic inflammation regulates glucose metabolism in cancer cells .	
22354042_s4	Here , we show that pro-inflammatory cytokines promote glycolysis in breast cancer cells , and that the inflammation-induced miR-155 functions as an important mediator in this process .	cellular energetics,tumor promoting inflammation
22354042_s5	We further show that miR-155 acts to upregulate hexokinase 2 ( hk2 ) , through two distinct mechanisms .	
22354042_s6	First , miR-155 promotes hk2 transcription by activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) , a transcriptional activator for hk2 .	
22354042_s7	Second , via targeting C/EBPβ ( a transcriptional activator for mir-143 ) , miR-155 represses mir-143 , a negative regulator of hk2 , thus resulting in upregulation of hk2 expression at the post-transcriptional level .	
22354042_s8	The miR-155-mediated hk2 upregulation also appears to operate in other types of cancer cells examined .	
22354042_s9	We suggest that the miR-155/miR-143/HK2 axis may represent a common mechanism linking inflammation to the altered metabolism in cancer cells .	cellular energetics,tumor promoting inflammation
22355784_s0	Electronic properties of DNA are believed to play a crucial role in many phenomena in living organisms , for example the location of DNA lesions by base excision repair ( BER ) glycosylases and the regulation of tumor-suppressor genes such as p53 by detection of oxidative damage .	
22355784_s1	However , the reproducible measurement and modelling of charge migration through DNA molecules at the nanometer scale remains a challenging and controversial subject even after more than a decade of intense efforts .	
22355784_s2	Here we show , by analysing 162 disease-related genes from a variety of medical databases with a total of almost 20,000 observed pathogenic mutations , a significant difference in the electronic properties of the population of observed mutations compared to the set of all possible mutations .	genomic instability and mutation
22355784_s3	Our results have implications for the role of the electronic properties of DNA in cellular processes , and hint at the possibility of prediction , early diagnosis and detection of mutation hotspots .	genomic instability and mutation
22356938_s0	Mast cells ( MC ) are key effector cells in allergic reactions but also involved in host defence , tissue remodeling , angiogenesis , and fibrogenesis .	
22356938_s1	Here , we show that human intestinal fibroblasts ( FB ) suppress apoptosis in human intestinal MC dependent on IL-6 .	resisting cell death
22356938_s2	Intestinal FB produced IL-6 upon direct stimulation by intestinal MC in co-culture or by MC mediators such as TNF-Î± , IL-1Î² , tryptase or histamine .	
22356938_s3	MC incubated with IL-6 survived for up to 3 weeks similar to MC co-cultured with FB and MC survival could be blocked by neutralizing anti-IL-6 Abs .	
22356938_s4	Moreover , FB stimulated by MC mediators upregulated their expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 ( MMP-1 ) , a key fibrolytic enzyme .	
22356938_s5	Noteworthy , FB co-cultured with MC or treated with MMP-1 lost confluence and showed increased numbers of apoptotic cells .	resisting cell death
22356938_s6	Our data indicate an intimate cross talk between mucosal MC and FB resulting in MC survival and induction of a fibrolytic rather than a profibrotic state in FB .	
22357207_s0	Epidemiological studies have indicated that obesity is associated with colorectal cancer .	
22357207_s1	The obesity hormone leptin is considered as a key mediator for cancer development and progression .	
22357207_s2	The present study aims to investigate regulatory effects of leptin on colorectal carcinoma .	
22357207_s3	The expression of leptin and its receptor Ob-R was examined by immunohistochemistry in 108 Chinese patients with colorectal carcinoma .	
22357207_s4	The results showed that leptin/Ob-R expression was significantly associated with T stage , TNM stage , lymph node metastasis , distant metastasis , differentiation and expression of p-mTOR , p-70S6 kinase , and p-Akt .	activating invasion and metastasis
22357207_s5	Furthermore , the effects of leptin on proliferation and apoptosis of HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells were determined .	
22357207_s6	The results showed that leptin could stimulate the proliferation and inhibit the apoptosis of HCT-116 colon cells through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22357207_s7	Ly294002 ( a PI3K inhibitor ) and rapamycin ( an mTOR inhibitor ) could prevent the regulatory effects of leptin on the proliferation and apoptosis of HCT-116 cells via abrogating leptin-mediated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22357207_s8	All these results indicated that leptin could regulate proliferation and apoptosis of colorectal carcinoma through the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR signalling pathway .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22362593_s0	Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) is the most common pathological subtype of kidney cancer .	
22362593_s1	Here , we integrated an unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screen for ccRCC survival regulators with an analysis of recurrently overexpressed genes in ccRCC to identify new therapeutic targets in this disease .	
22362593_s2	One of the most potent survival regulators , the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 ( SLC16A3 ) , impaired ccRCC viability in all eight ccRCC lines tested and was the seventh most overexpressed gene in a meta-analysis of five ccRCC expression datasets .	
22362593_s3	MCT4 silencing impaired secretion of lactate generated through glycolysis and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis .	cellular energetics,resisting cell death
22362593_s4	Silencing MCT4 resulted in intracellular acidosis , and reduction in intracellular ATP production together with partial reversion of the Warburg effect in ccRCC cell lines .	cellular energetics
22362593_s5	Intra-tumoural heterogeneity in the intensity of MCT4 protein expression was observed in primary ccRCCs .	
22362593_s6	MCT4 protein expression analysis based on the highest intensity of expression in primary ccRCCs was associated with poorer relapse-free survival , whereas modal intensity correlated with Fuhrman nuclear grade .	
22362593_s7	Consistent with the potential selection of subclones enriched for MCT4 expression during disease progression , MCT4 expression was greater at sites of metastatic disease .	activating invasion and metastasis
22362593_s8	These data suggest that MCT4 may serve as a novel metabolic target to reverse the Warburg effect and limit disease progression in ccRCC .	cellular energetics
22372864_s0	A novel series of N(4)-(3-chlorophenyl)-5-(oxazol-2-yl)pyrimidine-4,6-diamines were synthesized and evaluated as dual inhibitors of HER-1/HER-2 tyrosine kinases .	
22372864_s1	In contrast to the currently approved HER-2-targeted agent ( lapatinib , 1 ) , our irreversible HER-1/HER-2 inhibitors have the potential to overcome the clinically relevant and mutation-induced drug resistance .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22372864_s2	The selected compound ( 19a ) showed excellent inhibitory activity toward HER-1/HER-2 tyrosine kinases with selectivity over 20 other kinases and inhibited the proliferation of both cancer cell types : lapatinib-sensitive cell lines ( SK-Br3 , MDA-MB-175 , and N87 ) and lapatinib-resistant cell lines ( MDA-MB-453 , H1781 , and H1975 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22372864_s3	The excellent pharmacokinetic profiles of 19a in mice and rats led us to further investigation of a novel therapeutic agent for HER-2-targeting treatment of solid tumors , especially HER-2-positive breast/gastric cancer and HER-2-mutated lung cancer .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22384099_s0	The progression of prostate cancers ( PCs ) to locally invasive , androgen-independent and metastatic disease states is generally associated with treatment resistance and disease relapse .	
22384099_s1	The present study was undertaken to establish the possibility of using a combination of specific oncogenic products , including epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , pAkt , nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-ÎºB ) and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 ( MIC-1 ) as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for optimizing the management of patients with localized PC at earlier disease stages .	
22384099_s2	The immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence data have revealed that the expression levels of EGFR , Ser(473)-pAkt , NF-ÎºB p65 and MIC-1 proteins were significantly enhanced in the same subset of 76 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma specimens during the disease progression and these biomarkers were expressed in a small subpopulation of CD133(+) PC cells and the bulk tumor mass of CD133(-) PC cells .	
22384099_s3	Importantly , all of these biomarkers were also overexpressed in 80-100% of 30 PC metastasis bone tissue specimens .	activating invasion and metastasis
22384099_s4	Moreover , the results have indicated that the EGF-EGFR signaling pathway can provide critical functions for the self-renewal of side population ( SP ) cells endowed with stem cell-like features from highly invasive WPE1-NB26 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22384099_s5	Of therapeutic interest , the targeting of EGFR , pAkt , NF-ÎºB or MIC-1 was also effective at suppressing the basal and EGF-promoted prostasphere formation by SP WPE1-NB26 cells , inducing disintegration of SP cell-derived prostaspheres and decreasing the viability of SP and non-SP WPE1-NB26 cell fractions .	
22384099_s6	Also , the targeting of these oncogenic products induced the caspase-dependent apoptosis in chemoresistant SP WPE1-NB26 cells and enhanced their sensibility to the cytotoxic effects induced by docetaxel .	resisting cell death
22384099_s7	These findings suggest that the combined use of EGFR , pAkt , NF-ÎºB and/or MIC-1 may represent promising strategies for improving the accuracy of current diagnostic and prognostic methods and efficacy of treatments of PC patients in considering the disease heterogeneity , thereby preventing PC progression to metastatic and lethal disease states .	
22384233_s0	BACKGROUND Surgical procedures such as liver resection and liver transplantation are the first-line treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) patients .	
22384233_s1	However , the high incidence of tumor recurrence and metastasis after liver surgery remains a major problem .	
22384233_s2	Recent studies have shown that hepatic ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) injury and endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) contribute to tumor growth and metastasis .	
22384233_s3	We aim to investigate the mechanism of FTY720 , which was originally applied as an immunomodulator , on suppression of liver tumor metastasis after liver resection and partial hepatic I/R injury .	
22384233_s4	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS An orthotopic liver tumor model in Buffalo rat was established using the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line McA-RH7777 .	
22384233_s5	Two weeks after orthotopic liver tumor implantation , the rats underwent liver resection for tumor-bearing lobe and partial hepatic I/R injury .	
22384233_s6	FTY720 ( 2 mg/kg ) was administered through the inferior caval vein before and after I/R injury .	
22384233_s7	Blood samples were taken at days 0 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 and 28 for detection of circulating EPCs ( CD133+CD34+ ) .	
22384233_s8	Our results showed that intrahepatic and lung metastases were significantly inhibited together with less tumor angiogenesis by FTY720 treatment .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
22384233_s9	The number of circulating EPCs was also significantly decreased by FTY720 treatment from day 7 to day 28 .	
22384233_s10	Hepatic gene expressions of CXCL10 , VEGF , CXCR3 , CXCR4 induced by hepatic I/R injury were down-regulated in the treatment group .	inducing angiogenesis
22384233_s11	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE FTY720 suppressed liver tumor metastasis after liver resection marred by hepatic I/R injury in a rat liver tumor model by attenuating hepatic I/R injury and reducing circulating EPCs .	activating invasion and metastasis
22387176_s0	Partial or whole-brain irradiation is often required to treat both primary and metastatic brain cancer .	
22387176_s1	Radiation-induced normal tissue injury , including progressive cognitive impairment , however , can significantly affect the well-being of the approximately 200,000 patients who receive these treatments each year in the United States .	
22387176_s2	Although the exact mechanisms underlying radiation-induced late effects remain unclear , oxidative stress and inflammation are thought to play a critical role .	
22387176_s3	Microglia are key mediators of neuroinflammation .	
22387176_s4	Peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) Î´ has been shown to be a potent regulator of anti-inflammatory responses .	
22387176_s5	Thus , we hypothesized that PPARÎ´ activation would modulate the radiation-induced inflammatory response in microglia .	
22387176_s6	Incubating BV-2 murine microglial cells with the PPARÎ´ agonist L-165041 prevented the radiation-induced increase in : ( i ) intracellular reactive oxygen species generation , ( ii ) Cox-2 and MCP-1 expression , and ( iii ) IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± message levels .	tumor promoting inflammation
22387176_s7	This occurred , in part , through PPARÎ´-mediated modulation of stress-activated kinases and proinflammatory transcription factors .	tumor promoting inflammation
22387176_s8	PPARÎ´ inhibited NF-ÎºB via transrepression by physically interacting with the p65 subunit and prevented activation of the PKCÎ±/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/AP-1 pathway by inhibiting the radiation-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation .	tumor promoting inflammation
22387176_s9	These data support the hypothesis that PPARÎ´ activation can modulate radiation-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in microglia .	tumor promoting inflammation
22389673_s0	BACKGROUND Death receptors ( DR ) of the TNF family function as anti-tumor immune effector molecules .	
22389673_s1	Tumor cells , however , often exhibit DR-signaling resistance .	
22389673_s2	Previous studies indicate that radiation can modify gene expression within tumor cells and increase tumor cell sensitivity to immune attack .	
22389673_s3	The aim of this study is to investigate the synergistic effect of sub-lethal doses of ionizing radiation in sensitizing colorectal carcinoma cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis .	
22389673_s4	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The ability of radiation to modulate the expression of multiple death receptors ( Fas/CD95 , TRAILR1/DR4 , TRAILR2/DR5 , TNF-R1 and LTÎ²R ) was examined in colorectal tumor cells .	
22389673_s5	The functional significance of sub-lethal doses of radiation in enhancing tumor cell susceptibility to DR-induced apoptosis was determined by in vitro functional sensitivity assays .	
22389673_s6	The longevity of these changes and the underlying molecular mechanism of irradiation in sensitizing diverse colorectal carcinoma cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis were also examined .	
22389673_s7	We found that radiation increased surface expression of Fas , DR4 and DR5 but not LTÎ²R or TNF-R1 in these cells .	resisting cell death
22389673_s8	Increased expression of DRs was observed 2 days post-irradiation and remained elevated 7-days post irradiation .	
22389673_s9	Sub-lethal tumor cell irradiation alone exhibited minimal cell death , but effectively sensitized three of three colorectal carcinoma cells to both TRAIL and Fas-induced apoptosis , but not LTÎ²R-induced death .	resisting cell death
22389673_s10	Furthermore , radiation-enhanced Fas and TRAIL-induced cell death lasted as long as 5-days post-irradiation .	resisting cell death
22389673_s11	Specific analysis of intracellular sensitizers to apoptosis indicated that while radiation did reduce Bcl-X(L) and c-FLIP protein expression , this reduction did not correlate with the radiation-enhanced sensitivity to Fas and/or TRAIL mediated apoptosis among the three cell types .	resisting cell death
22389673_s12	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Irradiation of tumor cells can overcome Fas and TRAIL resistance that is long lasting .	resisting cell death
22389673_s13	Overall , results of these investigations suggest that non-lethal doses of radiation can be used to make human tumors more amenable to attack by anti-tumor effector molecules and cells .	
22395432_s0	We have recently proposed a new two-compartment model for understanding the Warburg effect in tumor metabolism .	
22395432_s1	In this model , glycolytic stromal cells produce mitochondrial fuels ( L-lactate and ketone bodies ) that are then transferred to oxidative epithelial cancer cells , driving OXPHOS and mitochondrial metabolism .	
22395432_s2	Thus , stromal catabolism fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy transfer .	
22395432_s3	We have termed this new cancer paradigm the " reverse Warburg effect, " because stromal cells undergo aerobic glycolysis , rather than tumor cells .	
22395432_s4	To assess whether this mechanism also applies during cancer cell metastasis , we analyzed the bioenergetic status of breast cancer lymph node metastases , by employing a series of metabolic protein markers .	
22395432_s5	For this purpose , we used MCT4 to identify glycolytic cells .	
22395432_s6	Similarly , we used TO MM20 and COX staining as markers of mitochondrial mass and OXPHOS activity , respectively .	
22395432_s7	Consistent with the " reverse Warburg effect, " our results indicate that metastatic breast cancer cells amplify oxidative mitochondrial metabolism ( OXPHOS ) and that adjacent stromal cells are glycolytic and lack detectable mitochondria .	activating invasion and metastasis,cellular energetics
22395432_s8	Glycolytic stromal cells included cancer-associated fibroblasts , adipocytes and inflammatory cells .	cellular energetics,tumor promoting inflammation
22395432_s9	Double labeling experiments with glycolytic ( MCT4 ) and oxidative ( TO MM20 or COX ) markers directly shows that at least two different metabolic compartments co-exist , side-by-side , within primary tumors and their metastases .	
22395432_s10	Since cancer-associated immune cells appeared glycolytic , this observation may also explain how inflammation literally " fuels " tumor progression and metastatic dissemination , by " feeding " mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells .	cellular energetics,tumor promoting inflammation
22395432_s11	Finally , MCT4(+) and TO MM20(-) " glycolytic " cancer cells were rarely observed , indicating that the conventional " Warburg effect " does not frequently occur in cancer-positive lymph node metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis,cellular energetics
22398780_s0	BACKGROUND Estrogen receptor Î² ( ERÎ² ) is the predominant ER in the colorectal epithelium , whose expression is greatly reduced in colorectal cancer compared with normal colon tissue .	
22398780_s1	Recent in vitro studies suggested that ERÎ² may suppress tumor growth .	
22398780_s2	No research was reported whether ERÎ² can be used as therapeutic agent for colon cancer .	
22398780_s3	METHODS In this study , ERÎ² gene constructed into adenoviral ( Ad ) vectors was used to treat colon cancer HCT-116 cells alone or in combination with raloxifene .	
22398780_s4	In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the therapeutic effects of ERÎ² and raloxifene in HCT-116 cells .	
22398780_s5	RESULTS Our results indicated that , although Ad-ERÎ² alone had no effect on the proliferation of HCT-116 cells , the combination of Ad-ERÎ² with raloxifene significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCT-116 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22398780_s6	The apparently apoptotic induction effects may partly explain the cytotoxicity of the two agents .	resisting cell death
22398780_s7	The results of the study of ERÎ² on migration and invasion of HCT-116 cells demonstrated that overexpression of ERÎ² significantly decreased cell migration and increased invasion of cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22398780_s8	The antitumor efficacies of ERÎ² as well as raloxifene were further investigated on HCT-116 tumor bearing mice .	
22398780_s9	Results demonstrated that both Ad-ERÎ² and raloxifene individually inhibited tumor growth .	
22398780_s10	The combination group showed the highest inhibitory efficiency compared with other three groups .	
22398780_s11	CONCLUSION These findings demonstrated that combined administration of Ad-ERÎ² with raloxifene represents a promising colon cancer therapeutic strategy .	
22410783_s0	Immortalization ( senescence bypass ) is a critical rate-limiting step in the malignant transformation of mammalian somatic cells .	
22410783_s1	Human cells must breach at least two distinct senescence barriers to permit unfettered clonal evolution during cancer development : ( 1 ) stress- or oncogene-induced premature senescence ( SIPS/OIS ) , mediated via the p16-Rb and/or ARF-p53-p21 tumour-suppressive pathways , and ( 2 ) replicative senescence triggered by telomere shortening .	
22410783_s2	In contrast , because their telomerase is constitutively active , cells from small rodents possess only the SIPS/OIS barrier , and are therefore useful for studying SIPS/OIS bypass in isolation .	
22410783_s3	Dermal fibroblasts from the Syrian hamster ( SHD cells ) are exceptionally resistant to spontaneous SIPS bypass , but it can be readily induced following exposure to a wide range of chemical and physical carcinogens .	
22410783_s4	Here we show that a spectrum of carcinogen-specific mutational and epigenetic alterations involving the INK4A ( p16 ) , p53 and INK4B ( p15 ) genes are associated with induced SIPS bypass .	
22410783_s5	With ionizing radiation , immortalization is invariably accompanied by efficient biallelic deletion of the complete INK4/CDKN2 locus .	enabling replicative immortality
22410783_s6	In comparison , SHD cells immortalized by the powerful polycyclic hydrocarbon carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene display transversion point mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 coupled with INK4 alterations such as loss of expression of p15 .	genomic instability and mutation
22410783_s7	Epimutational silencing of p16 is the primary event associated with immortalization by nickel , a human non-genotoxic carcinogen .	enabling replicative immortality
22410783_s8	As SIPS/OIS bypass is a prerequisite for the immortalization of normal diploid human epithelial cells , our results with the SHD model will provide a basis for delineating combinations of key molecular changes underpinning this important event in human carcinogenesis .	enabling replicative immortality
22415601_s0	BACKGROUND Neuroblastoma ( NBL ) is a common pediatric solid tumor , and outcomes for patients with advanced neuroblastoma remain poor despite extremely aggressive treatment .	
22415601_s1	Chemotherapy resistance at relapse contributes heavily to treatment failure .	
22415601_s2	The poor survival of patients with high-risk NBL prompted this investigation into novel treatment options with the objective of gaining a better understanding of resistance mechanisms .	
22415601_s3	On the basis of previous work and on data from publicly available studies , the authors hypothesized that human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 ( Her4 ) contributes to resistance .	
22415601_s4	METHODS Her4 expression was reduced with small-hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) to over express intracellular HER4 , and the authors tested its impact on tumor cell survival under various culture conditions .	
22415601_s5	The resulting changes in gene expression after HER4 knockdown were measured by using a messenger RNA ( mRNA ) array .	
22415601_s6	RESULTS HER4 expression was up-regulated in tumor spheres compared with the expression in monolayer culture .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22415601_s7	With HER4 knockdown , NBL cells became less resistant to anoikis and serum starvation .	
22415601_s8	Moreover , HER4 knockdown increased the chemosensitivity of NBL cells to cisplatin , doxorubicin , etoposide , and activated ifosfamide .	
22415601_s9	In mRNA array analysis , HER4 knockdown predominately altered genes related to cell cycle regulation .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
22415601_s10	In NBL spheres compared with monolayers , cell proliferation was decreased , and cyclin D expression was reduced .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22415601_s11	HER4 knockdown reversed cyclin D suppression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22415601_s12	Overexpressed intracellular HER4 slowed the cell cycle and induced chemoresistance .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22415601_s13	CONCLUSIONS The current results indicated that HER4 protects NBL cells from multiple exogenous apoptotic stimuli , including anoikis , nutrient deficiency , and cytotoxic chemotherapy .	resisting cell death
22415601_s14	The intracellular fragment of HER4 was sufficient to confer this phenotype .	
22415601_s15	HER4 functions as a cell cycle suppressor , maintaining resistance to cellular stress .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22415601_s16	The current findings indicate that HER4 overexpression may be associated with refractory disease , and HER4 may be an important therapeutic target .	
22427682_s0	Cigarette smoking is implicated in numerous diseases , including emphysema and lung cancer .	
22427682_s1	The clinical expression of lung disease in smokers is not well explained by currently defined variations in gene expression or simple differences in smoking exposure .	
22427682_s2	Alveolar macrophages play a critical role in the inflammation and remodeling of the lung parenchyma in smoking-related lung disease .	
22427682_s3	Significant gene expression changes in alveolar macrophages from smokers have been identified .	
22427682_s4	However , the mechanism for these changes remains unknown .	
22427682_s5	One potential mechanism for smoking-altered gene expression is via changes in cytosine methylation in DNA regions proximal to gene-coding sequences .	
22427682_s6	In this study , alveolar macrophage DNA from heavy smokers and never smokers was isolated and methylation status at 25,000 loci determined .	
22427682_s7	We found differential methylation in genes from immune-system and inflammatory pathways .	tumor promoting inflammation
22427682_s8	Analysis of matching gene expression data demonstrated a parallel enrichment for changes in immune-system and inflammatory pathways .	tumor promoting inflammation
22427682_s9	A significant number of genes with smoking-altered mRNA expression had inverse changes in methylation status .	
22427682_s10	One gene highlighted by this data was the FLT1 , and further studies found particular up-regulation of a splice variant encoding a soluble inhibitory form of the receptor .	
22427682_s11	In conclusion , chronic cigarette smoke exposure altered DNA methylation in specific gene promoter regions in human alveolar macrophages .	
22427941_s0	Keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF , fibroblast growth factor-7 ) is a fibroblast-derived mitogen , which stimulates proliferation of epithelial cells .	
22427941_s1	The expression of KGF by dermal fibroblasts is induced following injury and it promotes wound repair .	
22427941_s2	However , the role of KGF in cutaneous carcinogenesis and cancer progression is not known .	
22427941_s3	We have examined the role of KGF in progression of squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) of the skin .	
22427941_s4	The expression of KGF receptor ( KGFR ) mRNA was lower in cutaneous SCCs ( n = 6 ) than in normal skin samples ( n = 6 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22427941_s5	Expression of KGFR mRNA was detected in 6 out of 8 cutaneous SCC cell lines and the levels were downregulated by 24-h treatment with KGF .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22427941_s6	KGF did not stimulate SCC cell proliferation , but it reduced invasion of SCC cells through collagen .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22427941_s7	Gene expression profiling of three cutaneous SCC cell lines treated with KGF for 24 h revealed a specific gene expression signature characterized by upregulation of a set of genes specifically downregulated in SCC cells compared to normal epidermal keratinocytes , including genes with tumor suppressing properties ( SPRY4 , DUSP4 , DUSP6 , LRIG1 , PHLDA1 ) .	
22427941_s8	KGF also induced downregulation of a set of genes specifically upregulated in SCC cells compared to normal keratinocytes , including genes associated with tumor progression ( MMP13 , MATN2 , CXCL10 , and IGFBP3 ) .	
22427941_s9	Downregulation of MMP-13 and KGFR expression in SCC cells and HaCaT cells was mediated via ERK1/2 .	
22427941_s10	Activation of ERK1/2 in HaCaT cells and tumorigenic Ha-ras-transformed HaCaT cells resulted in downregulation of MMP-13 and KGFR expression .	
22427941_s11	These results provide evidence , that KGF does not promote progression of cutaneous SCC , but rather suppresses the malignant phenotype of cutaneous SCC cells by regulating the expression of several genes differentially expressed in SCC cells , as compared to normal keratinocytes .	
22428047_s0	Switching to a glycolytic metabolism is a rapid adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxia .	
22428047_s1	Although this metabolic conversion may primarily represent a rescue pathway to meet the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of proliferating tumor cells , it also creates a gradient of lactate that mirrors the gradient of oxygen in tumors .	
22428047_s2	More than a metabolic waste , the lactate anion is known to participate to cancer aggressiveness , in part through activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) pathway in tumor cells .	
22428047_s3	Whether lactate may also directly favor HIF-1 activation in endothelial cells ( ECs ) thereby offering a new druggable option to block angiogenesis is however an unanswered question .	
22428047_s4	In this study , we therefore focused on the role in ECs of monocarboxylate transporter 1 ( MCT1 ) that we previously identified to be the main facilitator of lactate uptake in cancer cells .	
22428047_s5	We found that blockade of lactate influx into ECs led to inhibition of HIF-1-dependent angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
22428047_s6	Our demonstration is based on the unprecedented characterization of lactate-induced HIF-1 activation in normoxic ECs and the consecutive increase in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) expression .	inducing angiogenesis
22428047_s7	Furthermore , using a variety of functional assays including endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis together with in vivo imaging of tumor angiogenesis through intravital microscopy and immunohistochemistry , we documented that MCT1 blockers could act as bona fide HIF-1 inhibitors leading to anti-angiogenic effects .	inducing angiogenesis
22428047_s8	Together with the previous demonstration of MCT1 being a key regulator of lactate exchange between tumor cells , the current study identifies MCT1 inhibition as a therapeutic modality combining antimetabolic and anti-angiogenic activities .	inducing angiogenesis
22431001_s0	Identification of molecular target(s) and mechanism(s) of silica-induced pulmonary toxicity is important for the intervention and/or prevention of diseases associated with exposure to silica .	
22431001_s1	Rats were exposed to crystalline silica by inhalation ( 15 mg m(-3) , 6 h per day , 5 days ) and global gene expression profile was determined in the lungs by microarray analysis at 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 weeks following termination of silica exposure .	
22431001_s2	The number of significantly differentially expressed genes ( &gt;1.5-fold change and &lt;0.01 false discovery rate P-value ) detected in the lungs during the post-exposure time intervals analyzed exhibited a steady increase in parallel with the progression of silica-induced pulmonary toxicity noticed in the rats .	
22431001_s3	Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of a representative set of 10 genes confirmed the microarray findings .	
22431001_s4	The number of biological functions , canonical pathways and molecular networks significantly affected by silica exposure , as identified by the bioinformatics analysis of the significantly differentially expressed genes detected during the post-exposure time intervals , also exhibited a steady increase similar to the silica-induced pulmonary toxicity .	
22431001_s5	Genes involved in oxidative stress , inflammation , respiratory diseases , cancer , and tissue remodeling and fibrosis were significantly differentially expressed in the rat lungs ; however , unresolved inflammation was the single most significant biological response to pulmonary exposure to silica .	tumor promoting inflammation
22431001_s6	Excessive mucus production , as implicated by significant overexpression of the pendrin coding gene , SLC26A4 , was identified as a potential novel mechanism for silica-induced pulmonary toxicity .	
22431001_s7	Collectively , the findings of our study provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary toxicity in the rat .

22436374_s0	BACKGROUND The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a validated therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .	
22436374_s1	However , current single agent receptor targeting does not achieve a maximal therapeutic effect , and some mutations confer resistance to current available agents .	
22436374_s2	In the current study we have examined , in different NSCLC cell lines , the combined effect of RNA interference targeting the EGFR mRNA , and inactivation of EGFR signaling using different receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) or a monoclonal antibody cetuximab .	
22436374_s3	METHODS NSCLC cells ( cell lines HCC827 , H292 , H358 , H1650 , and H1975 ) were transfected with EGFR siRNA and/or treated with the TKIs gefitinib , erlotinib , and afatinib , and/or with the monoclonal antibody cetuximab .	
22436374_s4	The reduction of EGFR mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR .	
22436374_s5	The down-regulation of EGFR protein expression was measured by western blot , and the proliferation , viability , caspase3/7 activity , and apoptotic morphology were monitored by spectrophotometry , fluorimetry , and fluorescence microscopy .	
22436374_s6	The combined effect of EGFR siRNA and different drugs was evaluated using a combination index .	
22436374_s7	RESULTS EGFR-specific siRNA strongly inhibited EGFR protein expression almost equally in all cell lines and inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in all NSCLC cell lines studied , albeit with a different magnitude .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22436374_s8	The effects on growth obtained with siRNA was strikingly different from the effects obtained with TKIs .	
22436374_s9	The effects of siRNA probably correlate with the overall oncogenic significance of the receptor , which is only partly inhibited by the TKIs .	
22436374_s10	The cells which showed weak response to TKIs , such as the H1975 cell line containing the T790M resistance mutation , were found to be responsive to siRNA knockdown of EGFR , as were cell lines with downstream TKI resistance mutations .	
22436374_s11	The cell line HCC827 , harboring an exon 19 deletion mutation , was more than 10-fold more sensitive to TKI proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction than any of the other cell lines .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22436374_s12	Cetuximab alone had no relevant in vitro activity at concentrations obtainable in the clinic .	
22436374_s13	The addition of EGFR siRNA to either TKIs or cetuximab additively enhanced growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in all five cell lines , independent of the EGFR mutation status ( wild-type or sensitizing mutation or resistant mutation ) .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22436374_s14	The strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with an EGFR-specific siRNA .	
22436374_s15	CONCLUSIONS EGFR knockdown by siRNA further decreases the cell growth of lung cancer cells that are treated with TKIs or cetuximab alone , confirming that single agent drug targeting does not achieve a maximal biological effect .	
22436374_s16	The siRNA inhibits EGFR oncogenic activity that bypasses downstream " resistance " mutations such as KRAS and PTEN .	
22436374_s17	The combined treatment of siRNA and EGFR inhibitory agents is additive .	
22436374_s18	The combination of a potent , irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib , with EGFR-specific siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer and other EGFR dependent cancers , including those with downstream resistance mutations .	
22438805_s0	EBV latent antigen EBNA3C is indispensible for in vitro B-cell immortalization resulting in continuously proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) .	
22438805_s1	EBNA3C was previously shown to target pRb for ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation , which facilitates G1 to S transition controlled by the major transcriptional activator E2F1 .	
22438805_s2	E2F1 also plays a pivotal role in regulating DNA damage induced apoptosis through both p53-dependent and -independent pathways .	
22438805_s3	In this study , we demonstrate that in response to DNA damage LCLs knocked down for EBNA3C undergo a drastic induction of apoptosis , as a possible consequence of both p53- and E2F1-mediated activities .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
22438805_s4	Importantly , EBNA3C was previously shown to suppress p53-induced apoptosis .	resisting cell death
22438805_s5	Now , we also show that EBNA3C efficiently blocks E2F1-mediated apoptosis , as well as its anti-proliferative effects in a p53-independent manner , in response to DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
22438805_s6	The N- and C-terminal domains of EBNA3C form a stable pRb independent complex with the N-terminal DNA-binding region of E2F1 responsible for inducing apoptosis .	resisting cell death
22438805_s7	Mechanistically , we show that EBNA3C represses E2F1 transcriptional activity via blocking its DNA-binding activity at the responsive promoters of p73 and Apaf-1 apoptosis induced genes , and also facilitates E2F1 degradation in an ubiquitin-proteasome dependent fashion .	resisting cell death
22438805_s8	Moreover , in response to DNA damage , E2F1 knockdown LCLs exhibited a significant reduction in apoptosis with higher cell-viability .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
22438805_s9	In the presence of normal mitogenic stimuli the growth rate of LCLs knockdown for E2F1 was markedly impaired ; indicating that E2F1 plays a dual role in EBV positive cells and that active engagement of the EBNA3C-E2F1 complex is crucial for inhibition of DNA damage induced E2F1-mediated apoptosis .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
22438805_s10	This study offers novel insights into our current understanding of EBV biology and enhances the potential for development of effective therapies against EBV associated B-cell lymphomas .	
22442157_s0	Gastrin stimulates the growth of pancreatic cancer cells through the activation of the cholecystokinin-B receptor ( CCK-BR ) , which has been found to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer .	
22442157_s1	In this study , we proposed that the CCK-BR drives growth of pancreatic cancer ; hence , interruption of CCK-BR activity could potentially be an ideal target for cancer therapeutics .	
22442157_s2	The effect of CCK-BR downregulation in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells was examined by utilizing specific CCK-BR-targeted RNA interference reagents .	
22442157_s3	The CCK-BR receptor expression was both transiently and stably downregulated by transfection with selective CCK-BR small-interfering RNA or short-hairpin RNA , respectively , and the effects on cell growth and apoptosis were assessed .	
22442157_s4	CCK-BR downregulation resulted in reduced cancer cell proliferation , decreased DNA synthesis , and cell cycle arrest as demonstrated by an inhibition of G(1) to S phase progression .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
22442157_s5	Furthermore , CCK-BR downregulation increased caspase-3 activity , TUNEL-positive cells , and decreased X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression , suggesting apoptotic activity .	resisting cell death
22442157_s6	Pancreatic cancer cell mobility was decreased when the CCK-BR was downregulated , as assessed by a migration assay .	activating invasion and metastasis
22442157_s7	These results show the importance of the CCK-BR in regulation of growth and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer .	
22442157_s8	Strategies to decrease the CCK-BR expression and activity may be beneficial for the development of new methods to improve the treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer .	
22449386_s0	The submandibular gland-derived tumor cell line SCA-9 is considered a useful tool to study the signaling pathways involved in proliferation , and their regulation , triggered by different stimuli .	
22449386_s1	It is proposed that the non neuronal cholinergic system : acethylcholine , the enzymes that synthesize and degrade it , and the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors , play a key role in tumorigenesis .	
22449386_s2	Here , we investigate the role of muscarinic receptors in SCA-9 cell proliferation , and the modulation of cholinergic signaling pathways exerted by the nuclear transcription factor ÎºB ( NF-ÎºB ) .	
22449386_s3	The activation of cholinergic receptors by carbachol ( 10â»â¹M ) increased cell proliferation ( P&lt;0.001 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22449386_s4	This was prevented by preincubating cells with the muscarinic antagonist atropine but not by mecamylamine , a nicotinic receptor blocker .	
22449386_s5	Phospholipase C ( PLC)/nitric oxide synthase ( NOS)/arginase pathway is involved in this effect , since carbachol stimulated nitric oxide production , increased NOS2 and NOS3 expressions , urea production , and arginase II expression ( P&lt;0.001 ) .	
22449386_s6	Also , phospholipase Aâ ( PLAâ)/cyclooxygenase ( COX ) pathway is up-regulated in carbachol-induced SCA-9 cell proliferation , because prostaglandin Eâ liberation ( P&lt;0.001 ) is increased and COX-1 expression is turned up ( P&lt;0.001 ) .	
22449386_s7	Interactions between PLC/NOS/arginases and PLAâ/COX pathways via its metabolites were detected .	
22449386_s8	SCA-9 cells exhibit a constitutive activation of NF-ÎºB , which regulates carbachol-induced NOS2 and 3 , arginase II and COX-1 expressions .	
22449386_s9	In addition , protein kinase C is involved in the up-regulation of NOS2 and arginase II enzymes induced by carbachol via NF-ÎºB .	
22449386_s10	In conclusion , the activation of cholinergic receptors in SCA-9 tumor cells promotes proliferation via muscarinic effector enzymes , and reveals the participation of NF-ÎºB at this step of tumorigenesis .	
22460537_s0	OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is a complex disease process involving interactions with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells .	
22460537_s1	We further investigated these relationships by suppressing stromal cell growth through the inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) .	
22460537_s2	STUDY DESIGN Preclinical investigation .	
22460537_s3	METHODS HNSCC cell lines ( FADU , OSC19 , Cal27 , SCC1 , SCC5 , SCC22A ) , fibroblast ( HS27 ) , and endothelial cells ( human umbilical vascular endothelial cell ) were cultured individually or in coculture .	
22460537_s4	Proliferation was assessed following treatment with a range of physiologic concentrations of FGFR inhibitor PD173074 .	
22460537_s5	Mice bearing established HNSCC xenografts were treated with PD173074 ( 12 mg/kg ) , and tumor histology was analyzed for stromal composition , proliferation ( Ki67 staining ) , and apoptosis ( TUNEL [ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ] staining ) .	
22460537_s6	RESULTS In vitro , inhibition of FGFR with PD173074 dramatically reduced proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells compared to untreated controls .	
22460537_s7	However , HNSCC cell proliferation was not affected by inhibition of FGFR .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22460537_s8	When cocultured with fibroblasts , HNSCC cells proliferation increased by 15% to 80% ( P &lt ; .01 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22460537_s9	Furthermore , this fibroblast-enhanced tumor cell growth was suppressed by FGFR inhibition .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22460537_s10	Additionally , treatment of mice bearing HNSCC xenografts with PD173074 resulted in significant growth inhibition ( P &lt ; .001 ) .	
22460537_s11	Additionally , those tumors from mice treated with PD173074 had a smaller stromal component , decreased proliferation , and increased apoptosis .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22460537_s12	CONCLUSIONS Targeting the FGFR pathway in head and neck cancer acts through the stromal components to decrease HNSCC growth in vivo and in vitro .	
22470124_s0	Certain components of apples have been shown to prevent cancer growth and impede cancer progression .	
22470124_s1	We hypothesized that extracted apple polysaccharides ( APs ) might , therefore , have anticancer effects , through a mechanism involving the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells , partly via the NF-ÎºB pathway .	
22470124_s2	Two human colorectal cancer ( CRC ) cell lines , HT-29 and SW620 , were exposed to different concentrations of APs ( 0.01 , 0.1 or 1 mg/ml ) .	
22470124_s3	Cell apoptosis was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay by flow cytometry and incorporation of 5'-bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) into DNA to identify the proliferating cell fraction , using fluorescence microscopy in vitro .	
22470124_s4	The protein levels of NF-ÎºB/p65 , I-ÎºBÎ± , pI-ÎºBÎ± , Bax , Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 were evaluated by western blotting .	
22470124_s5	The target sites of APs on CRC cells were assessed by flow cytometry .	
22470124_s6	At concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mg/ml , APs showed apoptosis-inducing effects , increased expressions of Bax , nuclear p65 and cytoplasmic pI-ÎºBÎ± , and decreased expressions of Bcl-2 , Bcl-xl and cytoplasmic I-ÎºBÎ± .	resisting cell death
22470124_s7	APs induced apoptosis by slightly activating the NF-ÎºB pathway ; the AP target site could be the Toll-like receptor 4 on the cell membrane .	
22470124_s8	These results demonstrate the potential of APs as agents for clinical prevention and treatment of CRC .	
22481237_s0	OBJECTIVE Expression of N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 ( NDRG1)/Cap43 is a prognostic indicator of human malignancies according to the tumor type in which it occurs .	
22481237_s1	We investigated how NDRG1/Cap43 could affect tumor growth and angiogenesis in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in vivo using an animal experimental model , and also how it could affect tumor angiogenesis and prognosis in NSCLC patients .	
22481237_s2	METHODS AND RESULTS Knockdown of NDRG1/Cap43 in lung cancer cells using a specific small interfering RNA resulted in growth rates in culture that were similar to those of counterpart control cells , but decreased tumor growth rates in vivo markedly .	
22481237_s3	Stable NDRG1/Cap43 knockdown did not induce consistent changes in the expression of Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) family proteins and c-Met in two human lung cancer cell lines in vitro .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22481237_s4	However , cell lines with NDRG1/Cap43 knockdown showed markedly decreased production of the potent angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor-A and interleukin-8 .	inducing angiogenesis
22481237_s5	Cells with knockdown of NDRG1/Cap43 showed marked reduction of tumor-induced angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
22481237_s6	Using immunohistochemistry , we examined 182 surgically resected specimens of NSCLC for expression of NDRG1/Cap43 and tumor angiogenesis .	
22481237_s7	High microvessel density in the tumor was significantly associated with nuclear positivity for NDRG1/Cap43 in both adenocarcinoma ( p = 0.003 ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( p=0.041 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
22481237_s8	For both adenocarcinoma ( p = 0.031 ) and squamous cell carcinoma ( p=0.034 ) , the survival curve of patients negative for nuclear NDRG1/Cap43 expression differed significantly from that of patients who were positive .	
22481237_s9	CONCLUSION Therefore , the expression of NDRG1/Cap43 may be predictive of tumor angiogenesis and poor prognosis in NSCLC .	inducing angiogenesis
22489696_s0	Although the expression of extracellular matrix protein-1 ( ECM1 ) has been documented in several tumor models , the function of ECM1 has remained unclear .	
22489696_s1	In this study , expression of ECM1 was detected by real time PCR and immunohistochemistry .	
22489696_s2	The role and mechanism of ECM1 overexpression in cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) cells were assessed by wound-healing , matrigel invasion assay and Western blotting .	
22489696_s3	Expression of ECM1 was significantly elevated in CCA tissues than that in adjacent noncancerous , cholangitis and normal bile duct tissues .	
22489696_s4	Its overexpression was associated with poor differentiation , lymph node metastasis , poor prognosis , and the level of CA199 , MMP-9 , estrogen receptor .	
22489696_s5	Knockdown of ECM1 suppressed migration and invasion of CCA cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22489696_s6	Using PI3K or IKK inhibitor reduced the level of phospho-Akt or phospho-IÎºBÎ± as well as ECM1 .	
22489696_s7	Taken together , overexpression of ECM1 may contribute to CCA initiation and progression through promoting migration and invasion of CCA cells , its overexpression was associated with Akt/NF-ÎºB signaling axis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22489823_s0	Curcumin , a well-known chemopreventive agent from turmeric , inhibits the expression of several oncogenes and cell proliferation genes in tumor cells .	
22489823_s1	This study aims to understand the precise molecular mechanism by which curcumin exerts its effects on retinoblastoma cells , by performing whole genome microarray analysis to determine the gene expression profiles altered by curcumin treatment .	
22489823_s2	Curcumin suppressed cell viability and altered the cell cycle of retinoblastoma cells .	
22489823_s3	We identified 903 downregulated genes and 1,319 upregulated genes when compared with the control cells after treatment with 20 Î¼M curcumin concentration for 48 h .	
22489823_s4	These genes were grouped into respective functional categories according to their biological function .	
22489823_s5	We found that curcumin regulated the expression of genes that are involved in the regulation of apoptosis , tumor suppressor , cell-cycle arrest , transcription factor , and angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22489823_s6	Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) analysis was used to validate the results of genome array , and the results were consistent with the obtained data .	
22489823_s7	In conclusion , treatment of curcumin affects the expression of genes involved in various cellular functions and plays an important role in tumor metastasis and apoptosis .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
22489823_s8	Thus , curcumin might be an effective chemopreventive agent for retinoblastoma cancer .	
22495714_s0	BACKGROUND Adenosine receptors ( A1 , A2A , A2B , A3 ) play an important role in the regulation of growth , proliferation and death of cancer and normal cells .	
22495714_s1	We recently showed the expression profile of A2A and A2B receptors in normal and tumor breast tissues .	
22495714_s2	In the present study , we used semiquantitative RT-PCR to measure the A1 and A3 gene expression levels in normal and tumor breast tissues .	
22495714_s3	METHODS Breast tumors ( n = 18 ) and non-neoplastic mammary tissues ( n = 10 ) were collected and histologically confirmed to be neoplastic or non-neoplastic , respectively .	
22495714_s4	Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA , and PCR was performed under optimized condition for each receptor subtype .	
22495714_s5	Amplification of beta-actin mRNA served as control for RT-PCR .	
22495714_s6	The PCR products were separated on 1.7% agarose gels .	
22495714_s7	The intensity of the bands was quantitated with ImageJ software after normalization against beta-actin expression .	
22495714_s8	RESULTS All breast tumor and normal tissue specimens expressed A1 and A3 adenosine receptor transcripts .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22495714_s9	However , we observed that the expression level of the A3 receptor in tumor tissues was 1.27-fold that of normal tissues , whereas there was no significant difference between the expression levels of A1 in normal and tumor tissues .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22495714_s10	CONCLUSIONS Interestingly , the results of the present study indicate that breast tumors exhibit a higher level of A3 transcripts ( than normal tissues ) and support the possible key role of A3 adenosine receptor in tumor development .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22495714_s11	However , further studies based on real-time quantitative RT-PCR are needed to identify the exact gene expression levels .	
22505206_s0	Manipulating acetylation status of key gene targets is likely to be crucial for effective cancer therapy .	
22505206_s1	In this study , we utilized green tea catechins , epicatechin ( EC ) , epigallocatechin ( EGC ) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) to examine the regulation of androgen receptor acetylation in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells by histone acetyl-transferase ( HAT ) activity .	
22505206_s2	EC , EGC and EGCG induced prostate cancer cell death , suppressed agonist-dependent androgen receptor ( AR ) activation and AR-regulated gene transcription .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22505206_s3	These results demonstrated a similar tendency to HAT inhibitory activities ; EGCG&gt;EGC&gt;EC .	
22505206_s4	The strongest HAT inhibitor among them , EGCG ( 50 ï¿½M ) , downregulated AR acetylation and finally , AR protein translocation to nucleus from the cytoplasmic compartment was effectively inhibited in the presence of the agonist .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22505206_s5	These results suggest another mechanism to develop effective therapeutics based on green tea catechins .	
22507866_s0	Furan , a potent rodent liver carcinogen , is found in many cooked food items and thus represents a human cancer risk .	
22507866_s1	Mechanisms for furan carcinogenicity were investigated in male F344 rats using the in vivo Comet and micronucleus assays , combined with analysis of histopathological and gene expression changes .	
22507866_s2	In addition , formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase ( Fpg ) and endonuclease III ( EndoIII)-sensitive DNA damage was monitored as a measure of oxidative DNA damage .	
22507866_s3	Rats were treated by gavage on four consecutive days with 2 , 4 , and 8mg/kg bw furan , doses that were tumorigenic in 2-year cancer bioassays , and with two higher doses , 12 and 16mg/kg .	
22507866_s4	Rats were killed 3h after the last dose , a time established as producing maximum levels of DNA damage in livers of furan-treated rats .	
22507866_s5	Liver Comet assays indicated that both DNA strand breaks and oxidized purines and pyrimidines increased in a near-linear dose-responsive fashion , with statistically significant increases detected at cancer bioassay doses .	genomic instability and mutation
22507866_s6	No DNA damage was detected in bone marrow , a non-target tissue for cancer , and peripheral blood micronucleus assays were negative .	genomic instability and mutation
22507866_s7	Histopathological evaluation of liver from furan-exposed animals produced evidence of inflammation , single-cell necrosis , apoptosis , and cell proliferation .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
22507866_s8	In addition , genes related to apoptosis , cell-cycle checkpoints , and DNA-repair were expressed at a slightly lower level in the furan-treated livers .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
22507866_s9	Although a mixed mode of action involving direct DNA binding cannot be ruled out , the data suggest that furan induces cancer in rat livers mainly through a secondary genotoxic mechanism involving oxidative stress , accompanied by inflammation , cell proliferation , and toxicity .	tumor promoting inflammation
22508045_s0	Many cancer cells metabolize glucose preferentially via pyruvate to lactate instead to CO(2) and H(2)O ( oxidative phosphorylation ) even in the presence of oxygen ( Warburg effect ) .	
22508045_s1	Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) is a drug which is able to shift pyruvate metabolism from lactate to acetyl-CoA ( tricarboxylic acid cycle ) by indirect activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH ) .	
22508045_s2	This can subsequently lead to an increased flow of oxygen in the respiratory chain , associated with enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) which may cause apoptosis .	
22508045_s3	In order to investigate if DCA may be suitable for neuroblastoma therapy , it was investigated on three human neuroblastoma cell lines whether DCA can reduce lactate production and enhance oxygen consumption .	
22508045_s4	The data show , that DCA ( in the low millimolar range ) is able to reduce lactate production , but there was only a slight shift to increased oxygen consumption and almost no effect on cell vitality , proliferation and apoptosis of the three cell lines investigated .	cellular energetics,resisting cell death
22508045_s5	Therefore , DCA at low millimolar concentrations seems to be only of minor efficacy for neuroblastoma treatment .	
22510844_s0	BACKGROUND Brain-metastatic breast cancer ( BMBC ) is increasing and poses a severe clinical problem because of the lack of effective treatments and because the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown .	
22510844_s1	Recent work has demonstrated that deregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) may correlate with BMBC progression .	
22510844_s2	However , the exact contribution that EGFR makes to BMBC remains unclear .	
22510844_s3	METHODS The role of EGFR in BMBC was explored by serial analyses in a brain-trophic clone of human MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells ( 231-BR cells ) .	
22510844_s4	EGFR expression was inhibited by stable short-hairpin RNA transfection or by the kinase inhibitor erlotinib , and it was activated by heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) .	
22510844_s5	Cell growth and invasion activities also were analyzed in vitro and in vivo .	
22510844_s6	RESULTS EGFR inhibition or activation strongly affected 231-BR cell migration/invasion activities as assessed by an adhesion assay , a wound-healing assay , a Boyden chamber invasion assay , and cytoskeleton staining .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22510844_s7	Also , EGFR inhibition significantly decreased brain metastases of 231-BR cells in vivo .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22510844_s8	Surprisingly , changes to EGFR expression affected cell proliferation activities less significantly as determined by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay , an anchorage-independent growth assay , and cell cycle analysis .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22510844_s9	Immunoblot analysis suggested that EGFR drives cells ' invasiveness capability mainly through phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B and phospholipase C Î³ downstream pathways .	activating invasion and metastasis
22510844_s10	In addition , EGFR was involved less in proliferation because of the insensitivity of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22510844_s11	CONCLUSIONS The current results indicated that EGFR plays more important roles in cell migration and invasion to the brain than in cell proliferation progression on 231-BR cells , providing new evidence of the potential value of EGFR inhibition in treating BMBC .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22525268_s0	Neurofibromatosis type 2 patients develop schwannomas , meningiomas and ependymomas resulting from mutations in the tumor suppressor gene , NF2 , encoding a membrane-cytoskeleton adapter protein called merlin .	
22525268_s1	Merlin regulates contact inhibition of growth and controls the availability of growth factor receptors at the cell surface .	
22525268_s2	We tested if microtubule-based vesicular trafficking might be a mechanism by which merlin acts .	
22525268_s3	We found that schwannoma cells , containing merlin mutations and constitutive activation of the Rho/Rac family of GTPases , had decreased intracellular vesicular trafficking relative to normal human Schwann cells .	genomic instability and mutation
22525268_s4	In Nf2-/- mouse Schwann ( SC4 ) cells , re-expression of merlin as well as inhibition of Rac or its effector kinases , MLK and p38(SAPK) , each increased the velocity of Rab6 positive exocytic vesicles .	
22525268_s5	Conversely , an activated Rac mutant decreased Rab6 vesicle velocity .	
22525268_s6	Vesicle motility assays in isolated squid axoplasm further demonstrated that both mutant merlin and active Rac specifically reduce anterograde microtubule-based transport of vesicles dependent upon the activity of p38(SAPK) kinase .	
22525268_s7	Taken together , our data suggest loss of merlin results in the Rac-dependent decrease of anterograde trafficking of exocytic vesicles , representing a possible mechanism controlling the concentration of growth factor receptors at the cell surface .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22525723_s0	Bladder cancer is one of the most common tumors of the genitourinary tract ; however , the molecular events underlying growth and invasion of the tumor remain unclear .	
22525723_s1	Here , role of the CXCR7 receptor in bladder cancer was further explored .	
22525723_s2	CXCR7 protein expression was examined using high-density tissue microarrays .	
22525723_s3	Expression of CXCR7 showed strong epithelial staining that correlated with bladder cancer progression .	
22525723_s4	In vitro and in vivo studies in bladder cancer cell lines suggested that alterations in CXCR7 expression were associated with the activities of proliferation , apoptosis , migration , invasion , angiogenesis and tumor growth .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22525723_s5	Moreover , CXCR7 expression was able to regulate expression of the proangiogenic factors IL-8 or VEGF , which may involve in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
22525723_s6	Finally , we found that signaling by the CXCR7 in bladder cancer cells activates AKT , ERK and STAT3 pathways .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22525723_s7	The AKT and ERK pathways may reciprocally regulate , which are responsible for in vitro and in vivo epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) process of bladder cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22525723_s8	Simultaneously targeting the two pathways by using U0126 and LY294002 inhibitors or using CCX733 , a selective CXCR7 antagonist drastically reduced CXCR7-induced EMT process .	
22525723_s9	Taken together , our data show for the first time that CXCR7 plays a role in the development of bladder cancer .	
22525723_s10	Targeting CXCR7 or its downstream-activated AKT and ERK pathways may prove beneficial to prevent metastasis and provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer .	
22530037_s0	BACKGROUND Recent data indicate the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) pathway is required for VEGF production and angiogenesis in various types of cancers .	
22530037_s1	STAT3 inhibitors have been shown to reduce tumor microvessel density in tumors but a direct anti-angiogenic activity has not been described .	
22530037_s2	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We investigated the direct action of a small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 ( LLL12 ) in human umbilical cord vascular endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in vitro , in a Matrigel model for angiogenesis in vivo , and its antitumor activity in a xenograft model of osteosarcoma .	
22530037_s3	LLL12 ( 100 nM ) significantly inhibited VEGF-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in HUVECs , reduced their proliferation/migration and inhibited VEGF-induced tube formation .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
22530037_s4	Morphologic analysis of LLL12 treated HUVECs demonstrated marked changes in actin/tubulin distribution and bundling .	
22530037_s5	In scid mice , LLL12 reduced microvessel invasion into VEGF-infused Matrigel plugs by â¼90% at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
22530037_s6	Following a period of tumor progression ( 2 weeks ) , LLL12 completely suppressed further growth of established OS-1 osteosarcoma xenografts .	
22530037_s7	Pharmacodynamic studies showed robust phosphorylated STAT3 in control tumors , whereas phospho-STAT3 was not detected in LLL12-treated OS-1 tumors .	
22530037_s8	Treated tumors demonstrated decreased proliferation ( Ki67 staining ) , and decreased microvessel density ( CD34 staining ) , but no significant increase in apoptosis ( TUNEL staining ) , relative to controls .	inducing angiogenesis,resisting cell death
22530037_s9	Assay of angiogenic factors , using an antibody array , showed VEGF , MMP-9 , Angiopoietin1/2 , Tissue Factor and FGF-1 expression were dramatically reduced in LLL12-treated tumors compared to control tumors .	inducing angiogenesis
22530037_s10	CONCLUSIONS These findings provide the first evidence that LLL12 effectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo .	inducing angiogenesis
22534171_s0	BACKGROUND Tissue factor ( TF ) , an initiator of blood coagulation , participates in cancer progression and metastasis .	
22534171_s1	We recently found that inhibition of MAPK/ERK upregulated both full length TF ( flTF ) and soluble isoform TF ( asTF ) gene expression and cell-associated TF activity in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells .	
22534171_s2	We explored the possible mechanisms , especially the possible interaction with EGFR and PI3K/Akt pathways .	
22534171_s3	METHODS A plasmid containing TF promoter -2174â plus luciferase reporter gene was introduced into MDA-MB-231 cells to evaluate TF promoter activity .	
22534171_s4	In order to study the interaction of these pathways , ERK inhibitor ( PD98059 ) , PI3K inhibitors ( LY294002 , wortmannin ) , Akt inhibitor ( A6730 ) , and EGFR inhibitor ( erlotinib ) as well as the corresponding siRNAs were used to treat MDA-MB-231 cells , and ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells .	
22534171_s5	Quantitative PCR and western blot were used to determine TF expression .	
22534171_s6	One stage clotting assays were used to measure pro-coagulation activity of the MDA-MB-231 cells .	
22534171_s7	RESULTS We show that PI3K inhibitors LY294002 , wortmannin and A6730 significantly inhibited TF promoter activity , and reduced TF mRNA and protein levels due to the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation .	
22534171_s8	In contrast , ERK inhibitor PD98059 and ERK siRNA enhanced TF promoter activity by 2.5 fold and induced an increase in TF mRNA and protein levels in a dose dependent manner in these cells .	
22534171_s9	The PI3K/Akt pathway was shown to be involved in PD98059-induced TF expression because the induction was inhibited by PI3K/Akt inhibitors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22534171_s10	Most interestingly , the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib and EGFR siRNA also significantly suppressed PD98059- or ERK siRNA-induced TF promoter activity and TF protein expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22534171_s11	Similar results were found with ovarian cancer cells SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 .	
22534171_s12	Furthermore , in MDA-MB-231 , mRNA levels of asTF were regulated in a similar way to that of TF in response to the cell treatment .	
22534171_s13	CONCLUSIONS This study showed a regulatory mechanism in which MAPK/ERK signals inhibit EGFR/PI3K/Akt-mediated TF expression in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells .	
22534171_s14	The same regulation was observed in ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cells .	
22534171_s15	Interestingly , we observed that both flTF and asTF could be regulated in a parallel manner in MDA-MB-231 .	
22534171_s16	As the PI3K/Akt pathway and EGFR regulate TF expression in cancer cells , targeting these signaling components is expected to potentially inhibit TF expression-associated tumor progression .	
22539965_s0	BACKGROUND The isothiocyanate sulforaphane ( SFN ) possesses interesting anticancer activities .	
22539965_s1	However , recent studies reported that SFN promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as well as DNA breakage .	
22539965_s2	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We investigated whether SFN is able to damage RNA , whose loss of integrity was demonstrated in different chronic diseases .	
22539965_s3	Considering the ability of SFN to protect from genotoxicity , we also examined whether SFN is able to protect from RNA damage induced by different chemicals ( doxorubicin , spermine , S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine , H(2)O(2) ) .	
22539965_s4	We observed that SFN was devoid of either RNA damaging and RNA protective activity in human leukemic cells .	genomic instability and mutation
22539965_s5	It was able to potentiate the RNA damage by doxorubicin and spermine .	
22539965_s6	In the first case , the effect was attributable to its ability of modulating the bioreductive activation of doxorubicin .	
22539965_s7	For spermine , the effects were mainly due to its modulation of ROS levels produced by spermine metabolism .	
22539965_s8	As to the cytotoxic relevance of the RNA damage , we found that the treatment of cells with a mixture of spermine or doxorubicin plus SFN increased their proapoptotic potential .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
22539965_s9	Thus it is conceivable that the presence of RNA damage might concur to the overall toxic response induced by a chemical agent in targeted cells .	
22539965_s10	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Since RNA is emerging as a potential target for anticancer drugs , its ability to enhance spermine- and doxorubicin-induced RNA damage and cytotoxicity could represent an additional mechanism for the potentiating effects of SFN associated with anticancer drugs .	
22550599_s0	Even when patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer undergo surgical resection at an early stage , recurrent disease often impairs the clinical outcome .	
22550599_s1	There are numerous causes potentially responsible for a relapse of the disease , one of them being extensive angiogenesis .	
22550599_s2	The balance of at least two systems , VEGF VEGFR and Ang Tie , regulates vessel formation .	
22550599_s3	The aim of this study was to determine the impact of surgery on the plasma levels of the main angiogenic factors during the first month after surgery in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients .	
22550599_s4	The study group consisted of 37 patients with stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer .	
22550599_s5	Plasma concentrations of Ang1 , Ang2 , sTie2 , VEGF , and sVEGF R1 were evaluated by ELISA three times : before surgical resection and on postoperative days 7 and 30 .	
22550599_s6	The median of Ang2 and VEGF concentrations increased on postoperative day 7 and decreased on day 30 .	inducing angiogenesis
22550599_s7	On the other hand , the concentration of sTie2 decreased on the 7th day after resection and did not change statistically later on .	
22550599_s8	The concentrations of Ang1 and sVEGF R1 did not change after the surgery .	inducing angiogenesis
22550599_s9	Lung cancer resection results in proangiogenic plasma protein changes that may stimulate tumor recurrences and metastases after early resection .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
22563920_s0	BACKGROUND Peritoneal transport status is important not only for prescription , but also as a prognostic index .	
22563920_s1	Flt-1 and Flk-1 , the major vascular endothelial growth factor receptors involved in angiogenesis and hyperpermeability , may play a potent role in determining peritoneal transport characteristics .	
22563920_s2	However , the relationship between them has not been studied to date .	
22563920_s3	We hypothesized that Flt-1 and Flk-1 expression in the peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients could be closely related to baseline peritoneal transport status .	
22563920_s4	METHODS Thirty-six new patients without a previous history of peritonitis were enrolled .	
22563920_s5	Clinical parameters such as age , sex , height , weight , causes of renal failure , and residual renal function were assessed .	
22563920_s6	Parietal peritoneal biopsies were obtained during implantation of peritoneal dialytic catheters .	
22563920_s7	Flt-1 and Flk-1 were semi-quantitatively evaluated by immunohistochemical staining .	
22563920_s8	Peritoneal microvascular density ( MVD ) was counted .	
22563920_s9	Within 6 weeks after commencing peritoneal dialysis , a standard peritoneal equilibration test was performed , and the dialysate-to-plasma concentration ratio for creatinine at 4 h ( D4/P Cr ) was determined .	
22563920_s10	The patients were divided into two groups based on the D4/P Cr : more than 0.65 ( Group H , n = 22 ) and less than or equal to 0.65 ( Group L , n = 14 ) .	
22563920_s11	The 24-h peritoneal protein excretion ( PPE ) was assayed .	
22563920_s12	Flt-1 and Flk-1 were correlated with peritoneal MVD , D4/P Cr , and PPE .	
22563920_s13	RESULTS Flt-1 and Flk-1 were detected in the peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients .	inducing angiogenesis
22563920_s14	Flt-1 expression was similar between the two groups , but Flk-1 expression in Group H was significantly higher than that in Group L ( p = 0.001 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
22563920_s15	Flt-1 expression did not show significant correlations with peritoneal MVD , D4/P Cr , and PPE .	inducing angiogenesis
22563920_s16	However , Flk-1 expression showed significant correlations with the above three parameters ( p &lt ; 0.001 for all ) .	inducing angiogenesis
22563920_s17	CONCLUSIONS For the first time , the expressions of Flt-1 and Flk-1 in peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients were detected .	inducing angiogenesis
22563920_s18	Flk-1 expression in peritoneal vasculature of uremic patients is closely correlated with the number of peritoneal microvessels , peritoneal small solute transport rate , and PPE .	inducing angiogenesis
22563920_s19	Our findings strongly suggest that Flk-1 may be a crucial determinant of baseline peritoneal transport characteristics .	inducing angiogenesis
22563920_s20	Further interventional studies are needed .	
22564725_s0	Cyclin E2 , but not cyclin E1 , is included in several gene signatures that predict disease progression in either tamoxifen-resistant or metastatic breast cancer .	
22564725_s1	We therefore examined the role of cyclin E2 in antiestrogen resistance in vitro and its potential for therapeutic targeting through cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibition .	
22564725_s2	High expression of CCNE2 , but not CCNE1 , was characteristic of the luminal B and HER2 subtypes of breast cancer and was strongly predictive of shorter distant metastasis-free survival following endocrine therapy .	
22564725_s3	After antiestrogen treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells , cyclin E2 mRNA and protein were downregulated and cyclin E2-CDK2 activity decreased .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22564725_s4	However , this regulation was lost in tamoxifen-resistant ( MCF-7 TAMR ) cells , which overexpressed cyclin E2 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22564725_s5	Expression of either cyclin E1 or E2 in T-47D breast cancer cells conferred acute antiestrogen resistance , suggesting that cyclin E overexpression contributes to the antiestrogen resistance of tamoxifen-resistant cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22564725_s6	Ectopic expression of cyclin E1 or E2 also reduced sensitivity to CDK4 , but not CDK2 , inhibition .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22564725_s7	Proliferation of tamoxifen-resistant cells was inhibited by RNAi-mediated knockdown of cyclin E1 , cyclin E2 , or CDK2 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22564725_s8	Furthermore , CDK2 inhibition of E-cyclin overexpressing cells and tamoxifen-resistant cells restored sensitivity to tamoxifen or CDK4 inhibition .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22564725_s9	Cyclin E2 overexpression is therefore a potential mechanism of resistance to both endocrine therapy and CDK4 inhibition .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22564725_s10	CDK2 inhibitors hold promise as a component of combination therapies in endocrine-resistant disease as they effectively inhibit cyclin E1 and E2 overexpressing cells and enhance the efficacy of other therapeutics .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22576685_s0	We investigated the effects of valproic acid ( VPA ) , a histone deacetylase inhibitor , in combination with hydralazine , a DNA methylation inhibitor , on the expression of cell-surface Fas and MHC-class I-related chain molecules A and B ( MICA and B ) , the ligands of NKG2D which is an activating receptor of NK cells , and on production of their soluble forms in HOS , U-2 OS and SaOS-2 human osteosarcoma cell lines .	
22576685_s1	We also examined the susceptibility of these cells to Fas- and NK cell-mediated cell death .	
22576685_s2	VPA did not increase the expression of Fas on the surface of osteosarcoma cells , while hydralazine did , and the combination of VPA with hydralazine increased the expression of cell-surface Fas .	resisting cell death
22576685_s3	In contrast , the combination of VPA with hydralazine did not increase the production of soluble Fas by osteosarcoma cells .	resisting cell death
22576685_s4	Both VPA and hydralazine increased the expression of cell-surface MICA and B in osteosarcoma cells , and their combination induced a greater increase in their expression .	
22576685_s5	VPA inhibited the production of both soluble MICA and MICB by osteosarcoma cells while hydralazine produced no effect .	
22576685_s6	Both VPA and hydralazine enhanced the susceptibility of osteosarcoma cells to Fas- and NK cell-mediated cell death and the combination of VPA with hydralazine further enhanced the effects .	resisting cell death
22576685_s7	The present results suggest that combined administration of VPA and hydrazine is valuable for enhancing the therapeutic effects of immunotherapy for osteosarcomas .	
22583549_s0	BACKGROUND Special AT-rich binding protein-1 ( SATB1 ) reprograms chromatin organization and transcription profiles to promote tumour growth and metastasis .	
22583549_s1	AIMS This study aimed to confirm the effects of SATB1 on the growth and metastasis of liver cancer and its specific regulation mechanism .	
22583549_s2	METHODS SATB1 expression was evaluated in human hepatoma tissue , adjacent noncancerous tissue and seven kinds of liver cancer cell lines .	
22583549_s3	Cell cycle , cell proliferation , apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) was investigated after enhanced or silenced expression of SATB1 .	
22583549_s4	The regulatory action of SATB1 on the expression of genes that are known to regulate cell cycle progression , apoptosis and EMT and the specific apoptotic pathway on which it acts were further analysed .	
22583549_s5	Nude mice that received subcutaneous implantation were used to study the effects of SATB1 on tumour growth in vivo .	
22583549_s6	RESULTS Our data show that the high expression of SATB1 was observed in the human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue ( 26/45 ) and liver cancer cell lines with high metastatic potential .	activating invasion and metastasis
22583549_s7	SATB1 upregulated CDK4 and downregulated p16 ( INK ) ( 4A ) to promote cell cycle progression and cell proliferation and prevented apoptosis by inhibiting the FADD-caspase-8-caspase-3 death receptor-mediated apoptosis pathway .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22583549_s8	SATB1 also induced EMT concomitant with increased expression of Snail1 , Slug , Twist and vimentin and decreased expression of E-cadherin , tight junction protein ZO-1 and desmoplakin .	activating invasion and metastasis
22583549_s9	SATB1 promoted the growth of tumour in vivo .	
22583549_s10	CONCLUSION These data suggest that the SATB1 gene may play an important role in the development and progression of liver cancer by regulation of genes related to cell cycle progression , apoptosis and EMT .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22589701_s0	Elevated aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells ( the Warburg effect ) may be attributed to respiration injury or mitochondrial dysfunction , but the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic significance remain elusive .	
22589701_s1	Here we report that induction of mitochondrial respiratory defect by tetracycline-controlled expression of a dominant negative form of DNA polymerase γ causes a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and increases ROS generation .	cellular energetics,tumor promoting inflammation
22589701_s2	We show that upregulation of NOX is critical to support the elevated glycolysis by providing additional NAD+ .	cellular energetics
22589701_s3	The upregulation of NOX is also consistently observed in cancer cells with compromised mitochondria due to the activation of oncogenic Ras or loss of p53 , and in primary pancreatic cancer tissues .	
22589701_s4	Suppression of NOX by chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of gene expression selectively impacts cancer cells with mitochondrial dysfunction , leading to a decrease in cellular glycolysis , a loss of cell viability , and inhibition of cancer growth in vivo .	cellular energetics
22589701_s5	Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function of NOX in cancer metabolism and suggests that NOX is a potential novel target for cancer treatment .	
22596188_s0	The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the effects of the environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) .	
22596188_s1	Recently , AHR has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer by virtue of its ability to modulate estrogen receptor-Î± ( ERÎ± ) signalling and/or its ability to block cell proliferation .	
22596188_s2	Our previous studies identified cyclin G2 ( CCNG2 ) , an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression , as an AHR target gene ; however , the mechanism of this regulation is unknown .	
22596188_s3	Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in T-47D human breast cancer cells revealed a TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR , nuclear co-activator 3 ( NCoA3 ) and the transcription factor forkhead box A1 ( FOXA1 ) , a key regulator of breast cancer cell signaling , to CCNG2 resulting in increases in CCNG2 mRNA and protein levels .	
22596188_s4	Mutation of the AHR response element ( AHRE ) and forkhead-binding sites abolished TCDD-induced CCNG2-regulated reporter gene activity .	
22596188_s5	RNA interference-mediated knockdown of FOXA1 prevented the TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR and NCoA3 to CCNG2 and reduced CCNG2 mRNA levels .	
22596188_s6	Interestingly , knockdown of FOXA1 also caused a marked decrease in ERÎ± , but not AHR protein levels .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22596188_s7	However , RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ERÎ± , a negative regulator of CCNG2 , had no effect on TCDD-dependent AHR or NCoA3 recruitment to or expression of CCNG2 .	
22596188_s8	These findings show that FOXA1 , but not ERÎ± , is essential for AHR-dependent regulation of CCNG2 , assigning a role for FOXA1 in AHR action .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22605917_s0	PURPOSE Precise monitoring of active angiogenesis in neovascular eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) enables sensitive use of antiangiogenic drugs and reduces adverse side effects .	
22605917_s1	So far , no in vivo imaging methods are available to specifically label active angiogenesis .	
22605917_s2	Here , we report such a technique using fluorophore-labeled cationic liposomes ( CL ) detected with a standard clinical in vivo scanning laser ophthalmoscope ( SLO ) .	
22605917_s3	METHODS C57Bl/6 mice underwent laser coagulations at day 0 ( d0 ) to induce choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) .	
22605917_s4	Liposomes labeled with Oregon green , rhodamine ( Rh ) , or indocyanine green ( ICG ) were injected into the tail vein at various time points after laser coagulation , and their fluorescence was observed in vivo 60 min later using an SLO , or afterwards in choroidal flatmounts or cryosections .	
22605917_s5	RESULTS SLO detected accumulated fluorescence only in active CNV lesions with insignificant background noise .	
22605917_s6	The best signal was obtained with CL-ICG .	
22605917_s7	Choroidal flatmounts and cryosections of the eye confirmed the location of retained CL in CNV lesions .	
22605917_s8	Neutral liposomes , in contrast , showed no accumulation .	
22605917_s9	CONCLUSIONS These results establish fluorophore-labeled CL as high affinity markers to selectively stain active CNV .	
22605917_s10	This novel , non-invasive SLO imaging technique could improve risk assessment and indication for current intraocular antiangiogenic drugs in neovascular eye diseases , as well as monitor therapeutic outcomes .	inducing angiogenesis
22605917_s11	Labeling of angiogenic vessels using CL can be of interest not only for functional imaging in ophthalmology but also for other conditions where localization of active angiogenesis is desirable .	inducing angiogenesis
22614006_s0	The Salvador/Warts/Hippo ( Hippo ) signaling pathway defines a novel signaling cascade regulating cell contact inhibition , organ size control , cell growth , proliferation , apoptosis and cancer development in mammals .	
22614006_s1	The upstream regulation of this pathway has been less well defined than the core kinase cassette .	
22614006_s2	KIBRA has been shown to function as an upstream member of the Hippo pathway by influencing the phosphorylation of LATS and YAP , but functional consequences of these biochemical changes have not been previously addressed .	
22614006_s3	We show that in MCF10A cells , loss of KIBRA expression displays epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) features , which are concomitant with decreased LATS and YAP phosphorylation , but not MST1/2 .	activating invasion and metastasis
22614006_s4	In addition , ectopic KIBRA expression antagonizes YAP via the serine 127 phosphorylation site and we show that KIBRA , Willin and Merlin differentially regulate genes controlled by YAP .	
22614006_s5	Finally , reduced KIBRA expression in primary breast cancer specimens correlates with the recently described claudin-low subtype , an aggressive sub-group with EMT features and a poor prognosis .	
22618884_s0	Breast cancer consists in a chronic inflammatory disease with multiple biological and clinical behaviors .	
22618884_s1	Based on high throughput technologies data , this disease is currently classified according to the molecular expression of estrogen ( ER ) , progesterone ( PR ) and human epidermal growth factor ( HER-2 ) receptors .	
22618884_s2	In this study , we defined the inflammatory profile of the main molecular subtypes of breast cancer patients : luminal ( ER and PR positive , HER-2 negative ) , HER-2 enriched ( HER-2 positive ) and triple negative ( ER , PR and HER-2 negative ) .	
22618884_s3	Cytokines panel was assessed by measurement of TNF-Î± , TGF-Î² , IL-1 , IL-10 and IL-12 plasmatic levels .	
22618884_s4	Oxidative profile was assessed by determination of lipid peroxidation , total antioxidant capacity of plasma , malondialdehyde levels , carbonyl content and nitric oxide ( NO ) .	
22618884_s5	Clinical data were correlated with inflammatory findings .	tumor promoting inflammation
22618884_s6	Our findings demonstrated that patients bearing the luminal subtype displayed high TNF-Î± , TGF-Î² and enhanced oxidative stress levels associated with reduced IL-12 .	tumor promoting inflammation
22618884_s7	HER-2-enriched group exhibited higher levels of TNF-Î± , IL-12 and TGF-Î² associated with enhanced oxidative stress .	tumor promoting inflammation
22618884_s8	Triple-negative subtype exhibited the most aggressive profile of disease behavior , with reduction in both TNF-Î± and TGF-Î² , with high levels of lipid peroxidation and NO .	tumor promoting inflammation
22618884_s9	The clinical importance of our findings lies in the fact that the inflammatory status varies in distinct ways due to molecular subtype of breast cancer , opening potential therapeutic targets to future therapies .	tumor promoting inflammation
22629318_s0	Radiotherapy is commonly used for cancer treatment .	
22629318_s1	However , it often results in side effects due to radiation damage in normal tissue , such as bone marrow ( BM ) failure .	
22629318_s2	Adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPC ) reside in BM next to the endosteal bone surface , which is lined primarily by hematopoietic niche osteoblastic cells .	
22629318_s3	Osteoblasts are relatively more radiation-resistant than HSPCs , but the mechanisms are not well understood .	
22629318_s4	In the present study , we demonstrated that the stress response gene REDD1 ( regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1 ) was highly expressed in human osteoblast cell line ( hFOB ) cells after γ irradiation .	genomic instability and mutation
22629318_s5	Knockdown of REDD1 with siRNA resulted in a decrease in hFOB cell numbers , whereas transfection of PCMV6-AC-GFP-REDD1 plasmid DNA into hFOB cells inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) and p21 expression and protected these cells from radiation-induced premature senescence ( PS ) .	enabling replicative immortality
22629318_s6	The PS in irradiated hFOB cells were characterized by significant inhibition of clonogenicity , activation of senescence biomarker SA-β-gal , and the senescence-associated cytokine secretory phenotype ( SASP ) after 4 or 8 Gy irradiation .	enabling replicative immortality
22629318_s7	Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the stress response proteins p53 and nuclear factor κ B ( NFkB ) interacted with REDD1 in hFOB cells .	
22629318_s8	Knockdown of NFkB or p53 gene dramatically suppressed REDD1 protein expression in these cells , indicating that REDD1 was regulated by both factors .	
22629318_s9	Our data demonstrated that REDD1 is a protective factor in radiation-induced osteoblast cell premature senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
22631638_s0	OBJECTIVE Angiogenesis represents a key element in the pathogenesis of malignancy .	
22631638_s1	There are no robust data on prognostic factors for overall survival ( OS ) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-targeted therapy .	
22631638_s2	The present study was conducted to establish a prognostic model for patients using an oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer .	
22631638_s3	METHODS Baseline characteristics and outcomes on 170 patients treated with FOLFIRI or XELOX plus anti-VEGF therapy-naive metastatic colorectal cancer were collected from three Turkey cancer centers .	
22631638_s4	Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors for OS .	
22631638_s5	RESULTS The median OS for the whole cohort was 19 months ( 95% CI , 14.3 to 23.6 months ) .	
22631638_s6	Three of the seven adverse prognostic factors according to the Anatolian Society of Medical Oncology ( ASMO ) were independent predictors of short survival : serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) greater than the upper limit of normal ( ULN ; p&lt;0.001 ) ; neutrophils greater than the ULN ( p&lt;0.0014 ) ; and progression free survival ( PFS ) less than 6 months ( p =0.001 ) .	
22631638_s7	CONCLUSION Serum LDH and neutrophil levels were the main prognostic factors in predicting survival , followed by PFS .	
22631638_s8	This model validates incorporation of components of the ASMO model into patient care and clinical trials that use VEGF-targeting agents .	inducing angiogenesis
22634383_s0	Cancer cells have elevated aerobic glycolysis that is termed the Warburg effect .	
22634383_s1	But several tumor cells , including leukemic cells , also increase glutamine metabolism , which is initiated by glutaminase ( GLS ) .	
22634383_s2	The microRNA ( miRNA ) miR-23 targets GLS mRNA and inhibits expression of GLS protein .	
22634383_s3	Here we show that in human leukemic Jurkat cells the NF-ÎºB p65 subunit binds to miR-23a promoter and inhibits miR-23a expression .	
22634383_s4	Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors release p65-induced inhibition .	
22634383_s5	Jurkat cells growing in glutamine decrease proliferation due to cell accumulation in G0/G1 phase .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22634383_s6	Nevertheless , cells get used to this new source of energy by increasing GLS expression , which correlates with an increase in p65 expression and its translocation to the nucleus , leading to a higher basal NF-ÎºB activity .	
22634383_s7	Jurkat cells overexpressing p65 show increase basal GLS expression and proliferate faster than control cells in glutamine medium .	
22634383_s8	Overexpressing miR-23a in leukemic cells impaired glutamine use and induces mitochondrial dysfunction leading to cell death .	
22634383_s9	Therefore , p65 activation decreases miR-23a expression , which facilitates glutamine consumption allowing leukemic cells to use this alternative source of carbon and favoring their adaptation to the metabolic environment .	cellular energetics
22652558_s0	Most ovarian cancers are estrogen-positive and hormonal treatments using anti-estrogens or aromatase inhibitors are under investigation for treating the tumors that are resistant to conventional therapies .	
22652558_s1	In this study , the long-term effects of two anti-estrogens , namely 4-hydroxytamoxifen and fulvestrant ( or ICI182,780 ) , were investigated in ERÎ±-positive BG1 epithelial ovarian cancer cells .	
22652558_s2	To this aim , cells were grown in the presence of anti-estrogen concentrations that were sufficient to saturate the estrogen receptors , but were neither cytotoxic nor cytostatic as indicated by the absence of inhibition of cell proliferation .	
22652558_s3	In these conditions and despite the lack of cytostatic effect of the drugs , long-term treatment ( 3 months ) with the pure anti-estrogen fulvestrant induced a specific , reproducible and irreversible inhibition of ERÎ± expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22652558_s4	This inhibition was accompanied by loss of estrogen-induced cell proliferation and gene expression as indicated by the analysis of several estrogen-responsive genes .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22652558_s5	ERÎ± down-regulation was not linked to deregulated expression of transcription factors which drive ERÎ± transcription and did not involve DNA methylation or histone deacetylation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22652558_s6	Altogether , these results demonstrate that non-cytotoxic concentrations of pure anti-estrogens affect estrogen signaling and might be relevant for the treatment for ovarian cancers .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22653530_s0	Semiconductor nanoparticles ( NPs ) became important and wide-used tool for cell imaging because of their unique remarkable properties .	
22653530_s1	Nevertheless , all previous investigations in this area were done on proliferating cells .	
22653530_s2	For the first time , this work demonstrates strong influence of cell active proliferation/contact inhibition of proliferation on uptake of NPs .	evading growth suppressors
22653530_s3	In addition , we show that cell division plays key-role in penetration of silicon carbide based NPs ( SiC NPs ) inside the cell nucleus .	
22653530_s4	This may very likely concern other types of NPs able to reach the cell nuclei .	
22653530_s5	In particular , observed effect of cell division gives perspectives for future selective cancer treatment with NPs .	
22664794_s0	We previously reported that hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) activated by angiotensin II ( AngII ) facilitate stromal fibrosis and tumor progression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) .	
22664794_s1	AngII has been known as a growth factor which can promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in renal epithelial cells , alveolar epithelial cells and peritoneal mesothelial cells .	
22664794_s2	However , in the past , the relationship between AngII and stromal cell-derived factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) in the microenvironment around cancer and the role of AngII on EMT of cancer cells has not been reported in detail .	
22664794_s3	SDF-1 and its specific receptor , CXCR4 , are now receiving attention as a mechanism of cell progression and metastasis .	
22664794_s4	In this study , we examined whether activated HSCs promote tumor fibrogenesis , tumor progression and distant metastasis by mediating EMT via the AngII/AngII type 1 receptor ( AT-1 ) and the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22664794_s5	Two human ICC cell lines and a human HSC line , LI-90 , express CXCR4 .	
22664794_s6	Significantly higher concentration of SDF-1Î± was released into the supernatant of LI-90 cells to which AngII had been added .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22664794_s7	SDF-1Î± increased the proliferative activity of HSCs and enhanced the activation of HSCs as a growth factor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22664794_s8	Furthermore , addition of SDF-1Î± and AngII enhanced the increase of the migratory capability and vimentin expression , reduced E-cadherin expression , and translocated the expression of Î²-catenin into the nucleus and cytoplasm in ICC cells .	
22664794_s9	Co-culture with HSCs also enhanced the migratory capability of ICC cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22664794_s10	These findings suggest that SDF-1Î± , released from activated HSCs and AngII , play important roles in cancer progression , tumor fibrogenesis , and migration in autocrine and paracrine fashion by mediating EMT .	activating invasion and metastasis
22664794_s11	Our mechanistic findings may provide pivotal insights into the molecular mechanism of the AngII and SDF-1Î±-initiated signaling pathway that regulates fibrogenesis in cancerous stroma , tumor progression and meta-stasis of tumor cells expressing AT-1 and CXCR4 .	activating invasion and metastasis
22665055_s0	Cancer cells typically display altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference of aerobic glycolysis , known as the Warburg effect , which facilitates cell proliferation .	
22665055_s1	Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) and oncoprotein Myc are two prominent transcription factors that drive glycolysis .	
22665055_s2	Previously , we reported that the estrogen-related receptors ( ERRs ) act as cofactors of HIF and enhance HIF-dependent transcription of glycolytic genes under hypoxia .	
22665055_s3	ERRs are orphan nuclear receptors and key regulators of energy metabolism by orchestrating mitochondrial biogenesis , fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) and oxidative phosphorylation .	
22665055_s4	Here , we show that ERRs also stimulate glycolysis under normoxia .	cellular energetics,sustaining proliferative signaling
22665055_s5	ERRs directly bind to and activate promoters of many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes , and the ERR-binding sites in such promoters are essential for ERR-mediated transcriptional activation .	cellular energetics,sustaining proliferative signaling
22665055_s6	ERRs interact with Myc , and the two factors synergistically activate transcription of glycolytic genes .	cellular energetics,sustaining proliferative signaling
22665055_s7	Furthermore , overexpression of ERRs increases glycolytic gene expression and lactate production .	cellular energetics,sustaining proliferative signaling
22665055_s8	Conversely , depletion of ERRs in cancer cells reduces expression of glycolytic genes and glucose uptake , resulting in decreased aerobic glycolysis and cell growth .	cellular energetics,sustaining proliferative signaling
22665055_s9	Taken together , these results suggest that ERRs are important transcriptional activators of the glycolytic pathway and contribute to the Warburg effect in cancer cells .	cellular energetics,sustaining proliferative signaling
22668016_s0	The results of experimental studies have indicated the pleiotropic effects of statins in organism , e.g. the influence on cell cycle , apoptosis or angiogenesis .	
22668016_s1	In this study , the effects of simvastatin on selected parameters of apoptosis and proliferation in chemocarcinogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis in female rats were determined .	
22668016_s2	Simvastatin was administered dietary at a dose of 18 mg/kg and highly effective dose of 180 mg/kg the entire experiment ( 18 weeks ) .	
22668016_s3	At autopsy mammary tumors were removed and prepared for immunohistochemical and histomorphological analysis .	
22668016_s4	In treated animals ( simvastatin 180 mg/kg ) , significant decrease by 12% in Bcl-2 protein expression and non-significant decrease by 27% of Ki67 protein expression in tumor cells compared to tumor cells in control animals were observed after semiquantitative evaluation .	
22668016_s5	Morphometrical analysis has shown significant proapototic shift in Bcl-2/Bax ratio in tumor cells .	resisting cell death
22668016_s6	In high grade control carcinoma cells , the expression of Ki67 increased by 37% ( non-significantly ) in comparison with control low grade carcinomas .	
22668016_s7	A histomorphological analysis of malignant tumors has revealed a shift from high grade to low grade carcinomas after simvastatin treatment .	
22668016_s8	The noticeable decrease of mammary tumor frequency and incidence in rats after simvastatin treatment was accompanied with antiapoptotic Blc-2 protein decrease and proapoptotic Bax protein increase in this experiment .	resisting cell death
22675506_s0	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality underscoring the need for safe and effective chemopreventive strategies .	
22675506_s1	Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is attractive in that it is an early critical event in HNSCC pathogenesis .	
22675506_s2	However , current agents lack efficacy or have unacceptable toxicity .	
22675506_s3	Several groups have demonstrated that the over-the-counter medication , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) has remarkable chemopreventive efficacy against colon carcinogenesis .	
22675506_s4	Importantly , we reported that this effect is mediated through EGFR internalization/degradation .	
22675506_s5	In the current study , we investigated the chemopreventive efficacy of this agent against HNSCC , using both the well validated animal model 4-NQO ( 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide ) rat model and cell culture with the human HNSCC cell line SCC-25 .	
22675506_s6	We demonstrated that daily topical application of 10% PEG-8000 in the oral cavity ( tongue and cavity wall ) post 4NQO initiation resulted in a significant reduction in tumor burden ( both , tumor size and tumors/tumor bearing rat ) without any evidence of toxicity .	
22675506_s7	Immunohistochemical studies depicted decreased proliferation ( number of Ki67-positive cells ) and reduced expression of EGFR and its downstream effectors cyclin D1 in the tongue mucosa of 4NQO-rats treated with PEG .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22675506_s8	We showed that EGFR was also markedly downregulated in SCC-25 cells by PEG-8000 with a concomitant induction of G1-S phase cell-cycle arrest , which was potentially mediated through upregulated p21(cip1/waf1) .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
22675506_s9	In conclusion , we demonstrate , for the first time , that PEG has promising efficacy and safety as a chemopreventive efficacy against oral carcinogenesis .	
22681312_s0	The therapeutic principle of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation ( allo-HCT ) is based on an active donor immune system that eliminates host-derived tumour cells .	
22681312_s1	We hypothesized that in addition to the alloantigen-driven anti-tumour response , disruption of the immunological microenvironment within the tumour is responsible for its elimination after allo-HCT .	
22681312_s2	We observed that induction of graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) significantly reduced the abundance of luc(+) FoxP3(+) regulatory T ( Treg ) cells in the tumour tissue , which is indicative of impaired or over-ridden tumour recruitment signals towards Treg cells .	
22681312_s3	Analysis of the intestines and liver revealed chemokines and purine nucleotides as candidates for attracting Treg to these sites of inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
22681312_s4	Despite its expression on tissue-residing Treg cells , the chemokine receptor CCR3 was not critical for Treg-cell function following allo-HCT .	
22681312_s5	Extracellular ATP can attract immune cells via P2Y2 .	tumor promoting inflammation
22681312_s6	P2Y2 was found to be expressed on Treg cells , and we found a partial reduction of GvHD prevention when P2Y2(-/-) rather than P2Y2(+/+) Treg cells were given .	tumor promoting inflammation
22681312_s7	Exogenous local inflammation reduced Treg-cell accumulation in the tumour , suggesting a potential clinical approach to prevent Treg-cell-mediated tumour escape .	tumor promoting inflammation
22681312_s8	In conclusion , we demonstrate that GvHD-related inflammation reduced Treg-cell numbers at the tumour sites , which may in turn help to explain the observation that patients with GvHD have a lower risk of tumour relapse .	tumor promoting inflammation
22687991_s0	To determine the threshold dose of Î²-Naphthoflavone ( BNF ) that induces hepatocellular tumor promoting effects , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance ( TBARS ) formation , and drug-metabolizing enzymes that protect against ROS generation , two-stage liver carcinogenesis model was used .	
22687991_s1	Partial hepatectomized rats ( n = 11 to 12 ) were fed diets containing 0 , 0.03 , 0.06 , 0.125 or 0.25% BNF for 6 weeks after an intraperitoneal injection of N-diethylnitrosamine ( DEN ) to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis .	
22687991_s2	Histopathologically , glutathione S-transferase placental form ( GST-P)-positive foci significantly increased in rats given 0.25% BNF .	
22687991_s3	No marked changes in ROS production and TBARS contents were observed between the BNF treated and DEN alone groups .	tumor promoting inflammation
22687991_s4	Real-time RT-PCR showed that the expression of Cyp1a1 , Cyp1a2 , Cyp1b1 and Nqo1 significantly increased in the groups given 0.03% BNF or more , but Ugt1a6 , Akr7a3 and Gstm1 significantly increased in the groups given 0.125% BNF or more .	
22687991_s5	Gpx2 and Yc2 significantly increased in the groups given 0.06% BNF or more and 0.25% BNF , respectively .	
22687991_s6	Inflammation-related genes such as Ccl2 , Mmp12 , Serpine1 and Cox-2 significantly increased in the 0.25% BNF group .	tumor promoting inflammation
22687991_s7	In immunohistochemistry , the number of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2)-positive cells increased in rats given 0.25% BNF .	
22687991_s8	These results suggest that 0.25% BNF is the threshold dose for liver tumor promotion , and the fact that inflammation-related genes and COX-2 protein increased in the 0.25% BNF group strongly suggests that inflammation is involved in the liver tumor promoting effect of BNF in rats .	tumor promoting inflammation
22689530_s0	The functional and therapeutic importance of the Warburg effect is increasingly recognized , and glycolysis has become a target of anticancer strategies .	
22689530_s1	We recently reported the identification of a group of novel small compounds that inhibit basal glucose transport and reduce cancer cell growth by a glucose deprivation-like mechanism .	
22689530_s2	We hypothesized that the compounds target Glut1 and are efficacious in vivo as anticancer agents .	
22689530_s3	Here , we report that a novel representative compound WZB117 not only inhibited cell growth in cancer cell lines but also inhibited cancer growth in a nude mouse model .	
22689530_s4	Daily intraperitoneal injection of WZB117 at 10 mg/kg resulted in a more than 70% reduction in the size of human lung cancer of A549 cell origin .	
22689530_s5	Mechanism studies showed that WZB117 inhibited glucose transport in human red blood cells ( RBC ) , which express Glut1 as their sole glucose transporter .	
22689530_s6	Cancer cell treatment with WZB117 led to decreases in levels of Glut1 protein , intracellular ATP , and glycolytic enzymes .	cellular energetics
22689530_s7	All these changes were followed by increase in ATP-sensing enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) and declines in cyclin E2 as well as phosphorylated retinoblastoma , resulting in cell-cycle arrest , senescence , and necrosis .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22689530_s8	Addition of extracellular ATP rescued compound-treated cancer cells , suggesting that the reduction of intracellular ATP plays an important role in the anticancer mechanism of the molecule .	
22689530_s9	Senescence induction and the essential role of ATP were reported for the first time in Glut1 inhibitor-treated cancer cells .	
22689530_s10	Thus , WZB117 is a prototype for further development of anticancer therapeutics targeting Glut1-mediated glucose transport and glucose metabolism .	cellular energetics
22689960_s0	Helicobacter hepaticus-infected Rag2(-/-) mice emulate many aspects of human inflammatory bowel disease , including the development of colitis and colon cancer .	
22689960_s1	To elucidate mechanisms of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis , we undertook a comprehensive analysis of histopathology , molecular damage , and gene expression changes during disease progression in these mice .	
22689960_s2	Infected mice developed severe colitis and hepatitis by 10wk post-infection , progressing into colon carcinoma by 20wk post-infection , with pronounced pathology in the cecum and proximal colon marked by infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages .	tumor promoting inflammation
22689960_s3	Transcriptional profiling revealed decreased expression of DNA repair and oxidative stress response genes in colon , but not in liver .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
22689960_s4	Mass spectrometric analysis revealed higher levels of DNA and RNA damage products in liver compared to colon and infection-induced increases in 5-chlorocytosine in DNA and RNA and hypoxanthine in DNA .	genomic instability and mutation
22689960_s5	Paradoxically , infection was associated with decreased levels of DNA etheno adducts .	genomic instability and mutation
22689960_s6	Levels of nucleic acid damage from the same chemical class were strongly correlated in both liver and colon .	
22689960_s7	The results support a model of inflammation-mediated carcinogenesis involving infiltration of phagocytes and generation of reactive species that cause local molecular damage leading to cell dysfunction , mutation , and cell death .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
22689960_s8	There are strong correlations among histopathology , phagocyte infiltration , and damage chemistry that suggest a major role for neutrophils in inflammation-associated cancer progression .	
22689960_s9	Further , paradoxical changes in nucleic acid damage were observed in tissue- and chemistry-specific patterns .	
22689960_s10	The results also reveal features of cell stress response that point to microbial pathophysiology and mechanisms of cell senescence as important mechanistic links to cancer .	
22692904_s0	The secretin receptor ( SR ) , a G protein-coupled receptor , mediates the effects of the gastrointestinal hormone secretin on digestion and water homeostasis .	
22692904_s1	Recently , high SR expression has been observed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas , cholangiocellular carcinomas , gastrinomas , and bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumors .	
22692904_s2	Receptor overexpression associates with enhanced secretin-mediated signaling , but whether this molecule plays an independent role in tumorigenesis is currently unknown .	
22692904_s3	We recently discovered that pheochromocytomas developing in rats affected by the MENX ( multiple endocrine neoplasia-like ) syndrome express at very high-level Sctr , encoding SR .	
22692904_s4	We here report that SR are also highly abundant on the membranes of rat adrenal and extraadrenal pheochromocytoma , starting from early stages of tumor development , and are functional .	
22692904_s5	PC12 cells , the best characterized in vitro pheochromocytoma model , also express Sctr at high level .	
22692904_s6	Thus , we used them as model to study the role of SR in neoplastic transformation .	
22692904_s7	Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Sctr decreases PC12 cells proliferation and increases p27 levels .	evading growth suppressors
22692904_s8	The proproliferative effect of SR in PC12 cells is mediated , in part , by the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K)/serine-threonine protein kinase ( AKT ) pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22692904_s9	Transfection of Sctr in Y1 adrenocortical carcinoma cells , expressing low endogenous levels of Sctr , stimulates cell proliferation also , in part , via the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22692904_s10	Because of the link between SR and PI3K/AKT signaling , tumor cells expressing high levels of the receptor ( MENX-associated primary pheochromocytoma and NCI-H727 human bronchopulmonary carcinoid cells ) respond well and in a SR-dependent manner to PI3K inhibitors , such as NVP-BEZ235 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22692904_s11	The association between SR levels and response to PI3K inhibition might open new avenues for the treatment of tumors overexpressing this receptor .	
22705236_s0	CDKN1C/P57 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor implicated in different human cancers , including hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) ; however , little is known regarding the role of CDKN1C/P57 and its regulation in HCC .	
22705236_s1	In this study , we show that the down-regulation of Notch1 and Notch3 in two HCC cell lines resulted in Hes1 down-regulation , CDKN1C/P57 up-regulation , and reduced cell growth .	
22705236_s2	In line with these data , we report that CDKN1C/P57 is a target of transcriptional repression by the Notch effector , Hes1 .	
22705236_s3	We found that the up-regulation of CDKN1C/P57 by cDNA transfection decreased tumor growth , as determined by growth curve , flow cytometry analysis , and cyclin D1 down-regulation , without affecting the apoptosis machinery .	
22705236_s4	Indeed , the expression of Bax , Noxa , PUMA , BNIP(3) , and cleaved caspase-3 was not affected by CDKN1C/P57 induction .	resisting cell death
22705236_s5	Morphologically CDKN1C/p57-induced HCC cells became flat and lengthened in shape , accumulated the senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase marker , and increased P16 protein expression .	enabling replicative immortality
22705236_s6	Evaluation of senescence in cells depleted both for Hes1 and CDKN1C/P57 revealed that the senescent state really depends on the accumulation of CDKN1C/p57 .	enabling replicative immortality
22705236_s7	Finally , we validated our in vitro results in primary HCCs , showing that Hes1 protein expression inversely correlates with CDKN1C/P57 mRNA levels .	
22705236_s8	In addition , reduced Hes1 protein expression is accompanied by a shorter time to recurrence after curative resection , suggesting that Hes1 may represent a biomarker for prediction of patients with poor prognosis .	
22707954_s0	Silver nanoparticles ( Ag-np ) have been used in medicine and commercially due to their anti-microbial properties .	
22707954_s1	Therapeutic potentials of these nanoparticles are being explored extensively despite the lack of information on their mechanism of action at molecular and cellular level .	
22707954_s2	Here , we have investigated the DNA damage response and repair following Ag-np treatment in mammalian cells .	
22707954_s3	Studies have shown that Ag-np exerts genotoxicity through double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) .	
22707954_s4	DNA-PKcs , the catalytic subunit of DNA dependent protein kinase , is an important caretaker of the genome which is known to be the main player mediating Non-homologous End-Joining ( NHEJ ) repair pathway .	
22707954_s5	We hypothesize that DNA-PKcs is responsible for the repair of Ag-np induced DNA damage .	
22707954_s6	In vitro studies have been carried out to investigate both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by Ag-np in normal human cells , DNA-PKcs proficient , and deficient mammalian cells .	
22707954_s7	Chemical inhibition of DNA-PKcs activity with NU7026 , an ATP-competitive inhibitor of DNA-PKcs , has been performed to further validate the role of DNA-PKcs in this model .	
22707954_s8	Our results suggest that Ag-np induced more prominent dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in DNA-PKcs deficient or inhibited cells .	
22707954_s9	The deficiency or inhibition of DNA-PKcs renders the cells with higher susceptibility to DNA damage and genome instability which in turn contributed to greater cell cycle arrest/cell death .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
22707954_s10	These findings support the fact that DNA-PKcs is involved in the repair of Ag-np induced genotoxicity and NHEJ repair pathway and DNA-PKcs particularly is activated to safeguard the genome upon Ag-np exposure .	genomic instability and mutation
22710435_s0	Proliferating cells consume more glucose to cope with the bioenergetics and biosynthetic demands of rapidly dividing cells as well as to counter a shift in cellular redox environment .	
22710435_s1	This study investigates the hypothesis that manganese superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD ) regulates cellular redox flux and glucose consumption during the cell cycle .	
22710435_s2	A direct correlation was observed between glucose consumption and percentage of S-phase cells in MnSOD wild-type fibroblasts , which was absent in MnSOD homozygous knockout fibroblasts .	
22710435_s3	Results from electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and flow cytometric assays showed a significant increase in cellular superoxide levels in S-phase cells , which was associated with an increase in glucose and oxygen consumption , and a decrease in MnSOD activity .	cellular energetics,sustaining proliferative signaling
22710435_s4	Mass spectrometry results showed a complex pattern of MnSOD-methylation at both lysine ( 68 , 89 , 122 , and 202 ) and arginine ( 197 and 216 ) residues .	
22710435_s5	MnSOD protein carrying a K89A mutation had significantly lower activity compared with wild-type MnSOD .	genomic instability and mutation
22710435_s6	Computational-based simulations indicate that lysine and arginine methylation of MnSOD during quiescence would allow greater accessibility to the enzyme active site as well as increase the positive electrostatic potential around and within the active site .	
22710435_s7	Methylation-dependent changes in the MnSOD conformation and subsequent changes in the electrostatic potential around the active site during quiescence versus proliferation could increase the accessibility of superoxide , a negatively charged substrate .	
22710435_s8	These results support the hypothesis that MnSOD regulates a " metabolic switch " during progression from quiescent through the proliferative cycle .	
22710435_s9	We propose MnSOD as a new molecular player contributing to the Warburg effect .	cellular energetics
22710713_s0	Past studies have shown that amplified insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1)/IGF1 receptor ( IGF1-R ) signalling has an important role in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) development , progression and resistance to treatment .	
22710713_s1	In this report , we demonstrate that downregulation of microRNA-497 ( miR-497 ) as a result of DNA copy number reduction is involved in upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22710713_s2	MiR-497 and miR-195 of the miR-15/16/195/424/497 family that share the same 3 ' untranslated region ( 3'UTR ) binding seed sequence and are predicted to target IGF1-R were concurrently downregulated in the majority of CRC tissues relative to paired adjacent normal mucosa .	
22710713_s3	However , only overexpression of miR-497 led to suppression of the IGF1-R 3'UTR activity and downregulation of the endogenous IGF1-R protein in CRC cells .	
22710713_s4	This was associated with inhibition of cell survival , proliferation and invasion , and increased sensitivity to apoptosis induced by various stimuli including the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil , and the death ligand tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22710713_s5	The biological effect of miR-497 on CRC cells was largely mediated by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signalling , as overexpression of an active form of Akt reversed its impact on cell survival and proliferation , recapitulating the effect of overexpression of IGF1-R .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22710713_s6	Downregulation of miR-497 and miR-195 appeared to associate with copy number loss of a segment of chromosome 17p13.1 , where these miRs are located at proximity .	
22710713_s7	Similarly to miR-195 , the members of the same miR family , miR-424 that was upregulated , and miR-15a , miR-15b and miR-16 that were unaltered in expression in CRC tissues compared with paired adjacent normal mucosa , did not appear to have a role in regulating the expression of IGF1-R .	
22710713_s8	Taken together , these results identify downregulation of miR-497 as an important mechanism of upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells that contributes to malignancy of CRC.Oncogene advance online publication , 18 June 2012 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.214 .	
22715397_s0	To elucidate the function of MAS-related GPCR , member D ( MRGD ) in cancers , we investigated the in vitro and in vivo oncogenic function of MRGD using murine fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 in which MRGD is stably expressed .	
22715397_s1	The expression pattern of MRGD in clinical samples was also analyzed .	
22715397_s2	We found that overexpression of MRGD in NIH3T3 induced focus formation and multi-cellular spheroid formation , and promoted tumors in nude mice .	
22715397_s3	In other words , overexpression of MRGD in NIH3T3 induced the loss of contact inhibition , anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumorigenesis .	evading growth suppressors
22715397_s4	Furthermore , it was found that the ligand of MRGD , beta-alanine , enhanced spheroid formation in MRGD-expressing NIH3T3 cells .	
22715397_s5	From investigation of clinical cancer tissues , we found high expression of MRGD in several lung cancers by immunohistochemistry as well as real time PCR .	
22715397_s6	Based on these results , MRGD could be involved in tumorigenesis and could also be a novel anticancer drug target .	
22718351_s0	Contact inhibition of locomotion ( CIL ) is the process by which cells stop the continual migration in the same direction after collision with another cell .	
22718351_s1	Highly invasive malignant cells exhibit diminished CIL when they contact stromal cells , which allows invasion of the tissue by tumors .	
22718351_s2	We show that Nm23-H1 is essential for the suppression of Rac1 through inactivation of Tiam1 at the sites of cell-cell contact , which plays a pivotal role in CIL .	evading growth suppressors
22718351_s3	U87MG cells show CIL when they contact normal glia .	
22718351_s4	In spheroid confrontation assays U87MG cells showed only limited invasion of the glial population , but reduction of Nm23-H1 expression in U87MG cells abrogated CIL resulting in invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
22718351_s5	In U87MG cells , Nm23-H1 is translocated to the sites of contact with glia through association with α-catenin and N-cadherin .	
22718351_s6	Mutants of Nm23-H1 , which lacked the binding ability with Tiam1 , or α-catenin did not restore CIL .	
22718351_s7	Moreover , the expression of ephrin-B1 in tumor cells disrupted CIL and promoted invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
22718351_s8	As one mechanism , ephrin-B1 inhibits the association of Nm23-H1 with Tiam1 , which contributes for activation of Rac1 .	
22718351_s9	These results indicate a novel function of Nm23-H1 to control CIL , and its negative regulation by ephrin-B1 .	
22719059_s0	Recent evidence indicates that the estrogen receptor-Î±-negative , androgen receptor ( AR)-positive molecular apocrine subtype of breast cancer is driven by AR signaling .	
22719059_s1	The MDA-MB-453 cell line is the prototypical model of this breast cancer subtype ; its proliferation is stimulated by androgens such as 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) but inhibited by the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) via AR-mediated mechanisms .	
22719059_s2	We report here that the AR gene in MDA-MB-453 cells contains a G-T transversion in exon 7 , resulting in a receptor variant with a glutamine to histidine substitution at amino acid 865 ( Q865H ) in the ligand binding domain .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22719059_s3	Compared with wild-type AR , the Q865H variant exhibited reduced sensitivity to DHT and MPA in transactivation assays in MDA-MB-453 and PC-3 cells but did not respond to non-androgenic ligands or receptor antagonists .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22719059_s4	Ligand binding , molecular modeling , mammalian two-hybrid and immunoblot assays revealed effects of the Q865H mutation on ligand dissociation , AR intramolecular interactions , and receptor stability .	
22719059_s5	Microarray expression profiling demonstrated that DHT and MPA regulate distinct transcriptional programs in MDA-MB-453 cells .	
22719059_s6	Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed that DHT- but not MPA-regulated genes were associated with estrogen-responsive transcriptomes from MCF-7 cells and the Wnt signaling pathway .	
22719059_s7	These findings suggest that the divergent proliferative responses of MDA-MB-453 cells to DHT and MPA result from the different genetic programs elicited by these two ligands through the AR-Q865H variant .	
22719059_s8	This work highlights the necessity to characterize additional models of molecular apocrine breast cancer to determine the precise role of AR signaling in this breast cancer subtype .	
22722849_s0	Sirtuin proteins regulate diverse cellular pathways that influence genomic stability , metabolism and ageing .	
22722849_s1	SIRT7 is a mammalian sirtuin whose biochemical activity , molecular targets and physiological functions have been unclear .	
22722849_s2	Here we show that SIRT7 is an NAD(+)-dependent H3K18Ac ( acetylated lysine 18 of histone H3 ) deacetylase that stabilizes the transformed state of cancer cells .	
22722849_s3	Genome-wide binding studies reveal that SIRT7 binds to promoters of a specific set of gene targets , where it deacetylates H3K18Ac and promotes transcriptional repression .	
22722849_s4	The spectrum of SIRT7 target genes is defined in part by its interaction with the cancer-associated E26 transformed specific ( ETS ) transcription factor ELK4 , and comprises numerous genes with links to tumour suppression .	
22722849_s5	Notably , selective hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac has been linked to oncogenic transformation , and in patients is associated with aggressive tumour phenotypes and poor prognosis .	
22722849_s6	We find that deacetylation of H3K18Ac by SIRT7 is necessary for maintaining essential features of human cancer cells , including anchorage-independent growth and escape from contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
22722849_s7	Moreover , SIRT7 is necessary for a global hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac associated with cellular transformation by the viral oncoprotein E1A .	
22722849_s8	Finally , SIRT7 depletion markedly reduces the tumorigenicity of human cancer cell xenografts in mice .	
22722849_s9	Together , our work establishes SIRT7 as a highly selective H3K18Ac deacetylase and demonstrates a pivotal role for SIRT7 in chromatin regulation , cellular transformation programs and tumour formation in vivo .	
22733972_s0	Elevated phosphorylation of estrogen receptor Î± ( ERÎ± ) at serines 118 ( S118 ) and 167 ( S167 ) is associated with favorable outcome for tamoxifen adjuvant therapy and may serve as surrogate markers for a functional ERÎ± signaling pathway in breast cancer .	
22733972_s1	It is possible that loss of phosphorylation at S118 and/or S167 could disrupt ERÎ± signaling , resulting in aggressive ERÎ±-independent breast cancer cells .	
22733972_s2	To this end , MCF-7 breast cancer cells were stably transfected with an ERÎ±-specific short hairpin RNA that reduced endogenous ERÎ± .	
22733972_s3	The resulting cell line was stably transfected with wild-type ERÎ± ( ER-AB cells ) , or ERÎ± containing serine to alanine mutation at S118 or S167 ( S118A cells and S167A cells , respectively ) .	
22733972_s4	These stable cell lines expressed approximately equivalent ERÎ± compared with parental MCF-7 cells and were evaluated for growth , morphology , migration/invasion , and ERÎ±-regulated gene expression .	
22733972_s5	S118A cells and S167A cells exhibited increased growth and migration/invasion in vitro .	activating invasion and metastasis
22733972_s6	Forward- and side-scatter flow cytometry revealed that S167A cells were smaller in size , and both S118A and S167A cells exhibited less cellular complexity .	
22733972_s7	S118A and S167A cells expressed pancytokeratin and membrane localization of Î²-catenin and did not express vimentin , indicating retention of epithelial lineage markers .	
22733972_s8	Expression of ERÎ±-target genes and other genes regulated by ERÎ± signaling or involved in breast cancer were markedly altered in both S118A and S167A cells .	
22733972_s9	In summary , attenuated phosphorylation of ERÎ± at S118 and S167 significantly affected cellular physiology and behavior in MCF-7 breast cancer cells , resulting in increased growth , migration/invasion , compromised expression of ERÎ± target genes , and markedly altered gene expression patterns .	activating invasion and metastasis
22742931_s0	Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide .	
22742931_s1	Major risk factors of HCC include infection with hepatitis B or C viruses , alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .	
22742931_s2	HCC is difficult to diagnose at early stage , and has a very poor survival rate when diagnosed at a late stage .	
22742931_s3	The majority of HCC-related deaths result from local invasion ( to cause liver failure ) or distant metastases .	
22742931_s4	There is an urgent need to identify effective molecular targets for the treatment of the disease .	
22742931_s5	As the target of an established class of therapeutic agent thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor Î³ ( PPARÎ³ ) has been widely studied for its role in the development of HCC .	
22742931_s6	A substantial body of evidence based on in vitro and in vivo models indicates that the activation of PPARÎ³ is able to inhibit HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the regulation of a panel of downstream effector molecules .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22742931_s7	PPARÎ³ activation also induces an inhibitory effect on HCC metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22742931_s8	Meanwhile , there is new evidence suggesting that PPARÎ³ inhibition could also be anti-tumorigenic .	
22742931_s9	In the present review , we summarize the available information on the role of PPARÎ³ in HCC development and spread , and discuss whether PPARÎ³ activation by TZDs could play a role in the treatment of HCC , summarizing both in vitro and in vivo .	
22742931_s10	Considering the available data , PPARÎ³ seems to exert beneficial effects against HCC and may therefore represent as a therapeutic target .	
22753494_s0	MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are small noncoding RNAs , 19-24 nucleotides in length , that regulate gene expression and are expressed aberrantly in most types of cancer .	
22753494_s1	MiRNAs also have been detected in the blood of cancer patients and can serve as circulating biomarkers .	
22753494_s2	It has been shown that secreted miRNAs within exosomes can be transferred from cell to cell and can regulate gene expression in the receiving cells by canonical binding to their target messenger RNAs .	
22753494_s3	Here we show that tumor-secreted miR-21 and miR-29a also can function by another mechanism , by binding as ligands to receptors of the Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) family , murine TLR7 and human TLR8 , in immune cells , triggering a TLR-mediated prometastatic inflammatory response that ultimately may lead to tumor growth and metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis,tumor promoting inflammation
22753494_s4	Thus , by acting as paracrine agonists of TLRs , secreted miRNAs are key regulators of the tumor microenvironment .	
22753494_s5	This mechanism of action of miRNAs is implicated in tumor-immune system communication and is important in tumor growth and spread , thus representing a possible target for cancer treatment .	tumor promoting inflammation
22753722_s0	Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , accounting for 80% of lung cancers , is the leading cause of all cancer deaths .	
22753722_s1	Previously , we demonstrated that delta-tocotrienol inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation , invasion and induces apoptosis by down-regulation of the Notch-1 signaling pathway .	
22753722_s2	The objective of this study was to investigate whether delta-tocotrienol , could enhance the anticancer effects of cisplatin .	
22753722_s3	Treatment with a combination of delta-tocotrienol and cisplatin resulted in a dose-dependent , significant inhibition of cell growth , migration , invasiveness , and induction of apoptosis in NSCLC cells , as compared to the single agents .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22753722_s4	This was associated with a decrease in NF-ÎºB DNA binding activity , decrease in Notch-1 , Hes-1 , Bcl-2 and increase in cleaved Caspase-3 and PARP expressions .	
22753722_s5	These results suggest that down-regulation of Notch-1 , via inhibition of NF-ÎºB signaling pathways by delta-tocotrienol and cisplatin , in combination , could provide a potential novel approach for tumor arrest in NSCLC , while lowering the effective dose of cisplatin .	
22760862_s0	Geraniol ( GOH ) , a naturally occurring monoterpene , has been shown to have antiproliferative , cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-inducing effects , and represents a promising cancer chemopreventive agent .	
22760862_s1	In the present study , we investigated the chemopreventive potential of GOH ( 50 and 100âmgâkg(-1) body weight ) against 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene ( DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA)-mediated skin tumorigenesis in Swiss albino mice .	
22760862_s2	The topical treatment of GOH , 30âmin prior to TPA ( 2âÂµg per 200âÂµl of acetone ) treatment significantly inhibited TPA-induced skin edema , hyperplasia , COX-2 induction and oxidative stress response .	tumor promoting inflammation
22760862_s3	The GOH treatment also resulted in reduction of TPA-induced ornithine decarboxylase activity and [ (3) H ] thymidine incorporation by 53% ( Pâ&lt;â0.001 ) and 41% ( Pâ&lt;â0.001 ) , respectively .	
22760862_s4	We found that GOH treatment significantly inhibited the tumor incidence and number of tumors ( Pâ&lt;â0.001 ) and extended the latency period from 4âweeks in DMBA/TPA treatment group to 10âweeks in GOH-pretreated mice .	
22760862_s5	Furthermore , we observed that GOH treatment significantly suppressed the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in skin tumor .	
22760862_s6	Consistently , GOH-treated skin tumors showed reduced expression of Bcl-2 and increased expression of Bax in these lesions .	resisting cell death
22760862_s7	Thus , it was concluded that GOH inhibits DMBA/TPA-mediated skin tumorigenesis by attenuating the Ras proliferation pathway and inducing pro-apoptotic state via inhibition of oxidative stress response and inflammation .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
22763454_s0	Circulating tumour cells ( CTCs ) shed into blood from primary cancers include putative precursors that initiate distal metastases .	
22763454_s1	Although these cells are extraordinarily rare , they may identify cellular pathways contributing to the blood-borne dissemination of cancer .	
22763454_s2	Here , we adapted a microfluidic device for efficient capture of CTCs from an endogenous mouse pancreatic cancer model and subjected CTCs to single-molecule RNA sequencing , identifying Wnt2 as a candidate gene enriched in CTCs .	
22763454_s3	Expression of WNT2 in pancreatic cancer cells suppresses anoikis , enhances anchorage-independent sphere formation , and increases metastatic propensity in vivo .	activating invasion and metastasis
22763454_s4	This effect is correlated with fibronectin upregulation and suppressed by inhibition of MAP3K7 ( also known as TAK1 ) kinase .	
22763454_s5	In humans , formation of non-adherent tumour spheres by pancreatic cancer cells is associated with upregulation of multiple WNT genes , and pancreatic CTCs revealed enrichment for WNT signalling in 5 out of 11 cases .	
22763454_s6	Thus , molecular analysis of CTCs may identify candidate therapeutic targets to prevent the distal spread of cancer .	
22767230_s0	Glycolysis is the initial step of glucose catabolism and is up-regulated in cancer cells ( the Warburg Effect ) .	
22767230_s1	Such shifts toward a glycolytic phenotype have not been explored widely in other biological systems , and the molecular mechanisms underlying the shifts remain unknown .	
22767230_s2	With proteomics , we observed increased glycolysis in disused human diaphragm muscle .	
22767230_s3	In disused muscle , lung cancer , and H(2)O(2)-treated myotubes , we show up-regulation of the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme muscle-type phosphofructokinase ( PFKm , &gt;2 fold , P&lt;0.05 ) and accumulation of lactate ( &gt;150% , P&lt;0.05 ) .	cellular energetics
22767230_s4	Using microRNA profiling , we identify miR-320a as a regulator of PFKm expression .	
22767230_s5	Reduced miR-320a levels ( to ∼50% of control , P&lt;0.05 ) are associated with the increased PFKm in each of these diverse systems .	
22767230_s6	Manipulation of miR-320a levels both in vitro and in vivo alters PFKm and lactate levels in the expected directions .	
22767230_s7	Further , miR-320a appears to regulate oxidative stress-induced PFKm expression , and reduced miR-320a allows greater induction of glycolysis in response to H(2)O(2) treatment .	cellular energetics,tumor promoting inflammation
22767230_s8	We show that this microRNA-mediated regulation occurs through PFKm's 3 ' untranslated region and that Ets proteins are involved in the regulation of PFKm via miR-320a .	
22767230_s9	These findings suggest that oxidative stress-responsive microRNA-320a may regulate glycolysis broadly within nature .	cellular energetics,tumor promoting inflammation
22768064_s0	Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) induces an uncoordinated S-phase-like cellular environment coupled with multiple prophase-like events in cells replicating the virus .	
22768064_s1	The EBV encoded Ser/Thr kinase BGLF4 has been shown to induce premature chromosome condensation through activation of condensin and topoisomerase II and reorganization of the nuclear lamina to facilitate the nuclear egress of nucleocapsids in a pathway mimicking Cdk1 .	
22768064_s2	However , the observation that RB is hyperphosphorylated in the presence of BGLF4 raised the possibility that BGLF4 may have a Cdk2-like activity to promote S-phase progression .	
22768064_s3	Here , we investigated the regulatory effects of BGLF4 on cell cycle progression and found that S-phase progression and DNA synthesis were interrupted by BGLF4 in mammalian cells .	
22768064_s4	Expression of BGLF4 did not compensate Cdk1 defects for DNA replication in S. cerevisiae .	
22768064_s5	Using time-lapse microscopy , we found the fate of individual HeLa cells was determined by the expression level of BGLF4 .	
22768064_s6	In addition to slight cell growth retardation , BGLF4 elicits abnormal chromosomal structure and micronucleus formation in 293 and NCP-TW01 cells .	genomic instability and mutation
22768064_s7	In Saos-2 cells , BGLF4 induced the hyperphosphorylation of co-transfected RB , while E2F1 was not released from RB-E2F1 complexes .	
22768064_s8	The E2F1 regulated activities of the cyclin D1 and ZBRK1 promoters were suppressed by BGLF4 in a dose dependent manner .	
22768064_s9	Detection with phosphoamino acid specific antibodies revealed that , in addition to Ser780 , phosphorylation of the DNA damage-responsive Ser612 on RB was enhanced by BGLF4 .	
22768064_s10	Taken together , our study indicates that BGLF4 may directly or indirectly induce a DNA damage signal that eventually interferes with host DNA synthesis and delays S-phase progression .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
22768158_s0	While human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) and human embryonal carcinoma cells ( hECCs ) have been studied extensively at the levels of the genome , transcriptome , proteome and epigenome our knowledge of their corresponding metabolomes is limited .	
22768158_s1	Here , we present the metabolic signatures of hESCs and hESCs obtained by untargeted gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) .	
22768158_s2	Whilst some metabolites are common to both cell types , representing the self-renewal and house-keeping signatures , others were either higher ( e.g. , octadecenoic acid , glycerol-3-phosphate , 4-hydroxyproline ) or lower ( e.g. , glutamic acid , mannitol , malic acid , GABA ) in hESCs ( H9 ) compared to hECCs ( NTERA2 ) , these represent cell type specific signatures .	
22768158_s3	Further , our combined results of GC-MS and microarray based gene expression profiling of undifferentiated and OCT4-depleted hESCs are consistent with the Warburg effect which is increased glycolysis in embryonic cells and tumor cells in the presence of O(2) while oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) is impaired or even shut down .	cellular energetics
22768158_s4	RNAi-based OCT4 knock down mediated differentiation resulted in the activation of the poised OXPHOS machinery by expressing missing key proteins such as NDUFC1 , UQCRB and COX , increase in TCA cycle activity and decreased lactate metabolism .	
22768158_s5	These results shed light on the metabolite layer of pluripotent stem cells and could potentially establish novel metabolic markers of self renewal and pluripotency .	
22776956_s0	Inhibition of cell proliferation by fenoterol and fenoterol derivatives in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells is consistent with Î²(2)-adrenergic receptor ( Î²(2)-AR ) stimulation .	
22776956_s1	However , the events that result in fenoterol-mediated control of cell proliferation in other cell types are not clear .	
22776956_s2	Here , we compare the effect of the Î²(2)-AR agonists ( R,R')-fenoterol ( Fen ) and ( R,R')-4-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol ( MNF ) on signaling and cell proliferation in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells by using Western blotting and [ (3)H]thymidine incorporation assays .	
22776956_s3	Despite the expression of Î²(2)-AR , no cAMP accumulation was observed when cells were stimulated with isoproterenol or Fen , although the treatment elicited both mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activation .	
22776956_s4	Unexpectedly , isoproterenol and Fen promoted HepG2 cell growth , but MNF reduced proliferation together with increased apoptosis .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22776956_s5	The mitogenic responses of Fen were attenuated by 3-(isopropylamino)-1-[(7-methyl-4-indanyl)oxy]butan-2-ol ( ICI 118,551 ) , a Î²(2)-AR antagonist , whereas those of MNF were unaffected .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22776956_s6	Because of the coexpression of Î²(2)-AR and cannabinoid receptors ( CBRs ) and their impact on HepG2 cell proliferation , these GÎ±(i)/GÎ±(o)-linked receptors may be implicated in MNF signaling .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22776956_s7	Cell treatment with ( R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-napthalenylmethanone ( WIN 55,212-2 ) , a synthetic agonist of CB(1)R and CB(2)R , led to growth inhibition , whereas inverse agonists of these receptors blocked MNF mitogenic responses without affecting Fen signaling .	
22776956_s8	MNF responses were sensitive to pertussis toxin .	
22776956_s9	The Î²(2)-AR-deficient U87MG cells were refractory to Fen , but responsive to the antiproliferative actions of MNF and WIN 55,212-2 .	
22776956_s10	The data indicate that the presence of the naphthyl moiety in MNF results in functional coupling to the CBR pathway , providing one of the first examples of a dually acting Î²(2)-AR-CBR ligand .	
22777894_s0	Focal inflammation causes systemic fever .	
22777894_s1	Cancer hyperthermia therapy results in shrinkage of tumors by various mechanisms , including induction of adaptive immune response .	
22777894_s2	However , the physiological meaning of systemic fever and mechanisms of tumor shrinkage by hyperthermia have not been completely understood .	
22777894_s3	In this study , we investigated how heat shock influences the adaptive immune system .	
22777894_s4	We established a cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) clone ( #IM29 ) specific for survivin , one of the tumor-associated antigens ( TAAs ) , from survivin peptide-immunized cancer patients ' peripheral blood , and the CTL activities were investigated in several temperature conditions ( 37-41ï¿½C ) .	
22777894_s5	Cytotoxicity and IFN-Î³ secretion of CTL were greatest under 39ï¿½C condition , whereas they were minimum under 41ï¿½C .	
22777894_s6	To address the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon , we investigated the apoptosis status of CTLs , expression of CD3 , CD8 , and TCRÎ±Î² by flow cytometry , and expression of perforin , granzyme B , and Fas ligand by western blot analysis .	
22777894_s7	The expression of perforin and granzyme B were upregulated under temperature conditions of 39 and 41ï¿½C .	
22777894_s8	On the other hand , CTL cell death was induced under 41ï¿½C condition with highest Caspase-3 activity .	resisting cell death
22777894_s9	Therefore , the greatest cytotoxicity activity at 39ï¿½C might depend on upregulation of cytotoxic granule proteins including perforin and granzyme B. These results suggest that heat shock enhances effector phase of the adaptive immune system and promotes eradication of microbe and tumor cells .	
22784709_s0	Src kinase is elevated in breast tumors that are ER/PR negative and do not overexpress HER2 , but clinical trials with Src inhibitors have shown little activity .	
22784709_s1	The present study evaluated preclinical efficacy of a novel peptidomimetic compound , KX-01 ( KX2-391 ) , that exhibits dual action as an Src and pretubulin inhibitor .	
22784709_s2	KX-01 was evaluated as a single-agent and in combination with paclitaxel in MDA-MB-231 , MDA-MB-157 , and MDA-MB-468 human ER/PR/HER2-negative breast cancer cells .	
22784709_s3	Treatments were evaluated by growth/apoptosis , isobologram analysis , migration/invasion assays , tumor xenograft volume , metastasis , and measurement of Src , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , microtubules , Ki67 , and microvessel density .	
22784709_s4	KX-01 inhibited cell growth in vitro and in combination with paclitaxel resulted in synergistic growth inhibition .	
22784709_s5	KX-01 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 tumor xenografts ( 1 and 5 mg/kg , twice daily ) .	
22784709_s6	KX-01 inhibited activity of Src and downstream mediator FAK in tumors that was coincident with reduced proliferation and angiogenesis and increased apoptosis .	inducing angiogenesis,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22784709_s7	KX01 also resulted in microtubule disruption in tumors .	
22784709_s8	Combination of KX-01 with paclitaxel resulted in significant regression of MDA-MB-231 tumors and reduced metastasis to mouse lung and liver .	activating invasion and metastasis
22784709_s9	KX-01 is a potently active Src/pretubulin inhibitor that inhibits breast tumor growth and metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22784709_s10	As ER/PR/HER2-negative patients are candidates for paclitaxel therapy , combination with KX-01 may potentiate antitumor efficacy in management of this aggressive breast cancer subtype .	
22791146_s0	Lentinula edodes mycelia ( L.E.M. ) is a dried powder extracted from shiitake mushrooms ( Lentinula edodes ) .	
22791146_s1	We previously demonstrated that it has immunomodulatory effects .	
22791146_s2	In this paper , the direct cytotoxic effects of the polysaccharide-rich fraction of L.E.M .	
22791146_s3	( L.E.M. ethanol precipitate ; LEP ) on HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells were investigated .	
22791146_s4	LEP directly killed the HepG2 cells efficaciously , but had only minor effects on normal rat hepatocytes and normal mouse dermal cells under the same conditions .	
22791146_s5	Characteristic morphological changes associated with apoptosis such as shrinkage , rounding , and floating as well as chromatin condensation were confirmed ; terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling ( TUNEL ) staining was positive as determined by fluorescence microscopy analyses .	resisting cell death
22791146_s6	The caspase-3 and -8 death receptor pathway was found largely responsible for the apoptotic death of HepG2 cells treated with LEP .	resisting cell death
22791146_s7	In conclusion , LEP can directly induce apoptosis of HepG2 cells , and thus may have potential chemotherapeutic applications for the treatment of HCC .	resisting cell death
22797064_s0	Epigenetic deregulation of gene expression has a role in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer ( PCa ) .	
22797064_s1	The histone methyltransferase MMSET/WHSC1 ( Multiple Myeloma SET domain ) is overexpressed in a number of metastatic tumors , but its mechanism of action has not been defined .	
22797064_s2	In this work , we found that PCa cell lines expressed significantly higher levels of MMSET compared with immortalized , non-transformed prostate cells .	
22797064_s3	Knockdown experiments showed that , in metastatic PCa cell lines , dimethylation of lysine 36 and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 ( H3K36me2 and H3K27me3 , respectively ) depended on MMSET expression , whereas depletion of MMSET in benign prostatic cells did not affect chromatin modifications .	
22797064_s4	Knockdown of MMSET in DU145 and PC-3 tumor cells decreased cell proliferation , colony formation in soft agar and strikingly diminished cell migration and invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
22797064_s5	Conversely , overexpression of MMSET in immortalized , non-transformed RWPE-1 cells promoted cell migration and invasion , accompanied by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
22797064_s6	Among a panel of EMT-promoting genes analyzed , TWIST1 expression was strongly activated in response to MMSET .	
22797064_s7	Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that MMSET binds to the TWIST1 locus and leads to an increase in H3K36me2 , suggesting a direct role of MMSET in the regulation of this gene .	
22797064_s8	Depletion of TWIST1 in MMSET-overexpressing RWPE-1 cells blocked cell invasion and EMT , indicating that TWIST1 was a critical target of MMSET , responsible for the acquisition of an invasive phenotype .	activating invasion and metastasis
22797064_s9	Collectively , these data suggest that MMSET has a role in PCa pathogenesis and progression through epigenetic regulation of metastasis-related genes .	activating invasion and metastasis
22802136_s0	Angiogenesis is critical for cancer growth and metastasis .	
22802136_s1	Steps of angiogenesis are energy consuming , while vascular endothelial cells are highly glycolytic .	
22802136_s2	Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) is a highly vascular tumor and this enhances its aggressiveness .	
22802136_s3	D-amino acid oxidase ( DAO ) is a promising therapeutic protein that induces oxidative stress upon acting on its substrates .	
22802136_s4	Oxidative stress-energy depletion ( OSED ) therapy was recently reported ( El Sayed et al. , Cancer Gene Ther , 19 , 1-18 , 2012 ) .	
22802136_s5	OSED combines DAO-induced oxidative stress with energy depletion caused by glycolytic inhibitors such as 3-bromopyruvate ( 3BP ) , a hexokinase II inhibitor that depleted ATP in cancer cells and induced production of hydrogen peroxide. 3BP disturbs the Warburg effect and antagonizes effects of lactate and pyruvate ( El Sayed et al. , J Bioenerg Biomembr , 44 , 61-79 , 2012 ) .	
22802136_s6	Citrate is a natural organic acid capable of inhibiting glycolysis by targeting phosphofructokinase .	
22802136_s7	Here , we report that DAO , 3BP and citrate significantly inhibited angiogenesis , decreased the number of vascular branching points and shortened the length of vascular tubules .	inducing angiogenesis
22802136_s8	OSED delayed the growth of C6/DAO glioma cells. 3BP combined with citrate delayed the growth of C6 glioma cells and decreased significantly the number and size of C6 glioma colonies in soft agar .	
22802136_s9	Human GBM cells ( U373MG ) were resistant to chemotherapy e.g. cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside , while 3BP was effective in decreasing the viability and disturbing the morphology of U373MG cells .	
22814258_s0	BACKGROUND It has been proven that metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 ( MACC1 ) is a new gene that is related to the invasion and metastasis of tumors .	
22814258_s1	MACC1 also regulates c-met expression .	
22814258_s2	The aim of this study is to explore the expressions of MACC1 and hepatocyte growth factor receptor ( c-met ) , and its relationship with invasion , metastasis , and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .	
22814258_s3	METHODS MACC1 and c-met expressions were detected in 103 cases of NSCLC and 40 cases of neighboring normal lung cancer tissue using immunohistochemistry .	
22814258_s4	RESULTS MACC1 and c-met expressions were significantly higher in lung cancer tissues than that in neighboring normal tissue ( P&lt;0.001 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
22814258_s5	MACC1 and c-met expressions were associated with poor differentiation , advanced T stages , lymph node metastasis , and advanced TNM stages ( P&lt;0.05 ) of NSCLC , but not with sex , age , smoking , and histological classification ( P&gt;0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
22814258_s6	In addition , a positive correlation between MACC1 and c-met expressions was observed ( r=0.403 , P&lt;0.001 ) .	
22814258_s7	The result from the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the five-year survival rate in patients with positive MACC1 and c-met expressions was remarkanly lower than that in patients with negative expressions ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	
22814258_s8	The result from the Cox regression analysis showed that MACC1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC ( P=0.026 ) .	
22814258_s9	CONCLUSIONS MACC1 and c-met have an important function in the differentiation , invasion , and metastasis of NSCLC .	activating invasion and metastasis
22814258_s10	MACC1 and c-met have poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC .	
22814258_s11	Moreover , MACC1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC .	
22815530_s0	Epigenetic changes in pediatric neuroblastoma may contribute to the aggressive pathophysiology of this disease , but little is known about the basis for such changes .	
22815530_s1	In this study , we examined a role for the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B , in particular , the truncated isoform DNMT3B7 , which is generated frequently in cancer .	
22815530_s2	To investigate if aberrant DNMT3B transcripts alter DNA methylation , gene expression , and phenotypic character in neuroblastoma , we measured DNMT3B expression in primary tumors .	
22815530_s3	Higher levels of DNMT3B7 were detected in differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas compared to undifferentiated neuroblastomas , suggesting that expression of DNMT3B7 may induce a less aggressive clinical phenotype .	
22815530_s4	To test this hypothesis , we investigated the effects of enforced DNMT3B7 expression in neuroblastoma cells , finding a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22815530_s5	DNMT3B7-positive cells had higher levels of total genomic methylation and a dramatic decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN family members that comprise AP1 transcription factors .	
22815530_s6	Consistent with an established antagonistic relationship between AP1 expression and retinoic acid receptor activity , increased differentiation was seen in the DNMT3B7-expressing neuroblastoma cells following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) compared to controls .	
22815530_s7	Our results indicate that DNMT3B7 modifies the epigenome in neuroblastoma cells to induce changes in gene expression , inhibit tumor growth , and increase sensitivity to ATRA .	
22825683_s0	Genetic and epigenetic changes in the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) tumour suppressor gene are common in sporadic conventional ( clear cell ) renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) .	
22825683_s1	The effects on VHL expression are unknown but increased understanding may be relevant clinically , either in terms of prognosis or in therapy selection .	
22825683_s2	We have examined the expression of VHL mutant RNA in 84 ccRCC tumours previously screened for mutations in genomic DNA , 56 of which contained 52 unique mutations or polymorphisms .	
22825683_s3	Based on the predicted change to the primary amino acid sequence , 24 of the mutations were missense , 11 resulted in frameshifts with premature truncation , 9 resulted in immediate truncation at the site of the mutation and 2 were frameshifts which extended the reading frame beyond the normal stop codon .	genomic instability and mutation
22825683_s4	Nine tumours had intronic variants , including substitution of invariant residues at splice sites , deletion of nucleotides spanning the exon-intron junction , an intronic variant of unknown function and the polymorphism c.463+43A&gt;G .	genomic instability and mutation
22825683_s5	Four variants were identified which were present in genomic DNA but not in mRNA .	
22825683_s6	Three of these , all encoding apparent missense changes to the primary amino acid sequence , were located close to the ends of exons , reduced the strength of the splice site and function as null rather than missense variants .	genomic instability and mutation
22825683_s7	One nonsense variant was not detectable in mRNA but all other mutations resulting in premature truncation codons ( PTCs ) were , suggesting truncating VHL mutations may potentially generate truncated VHL protein .	genomic instability and mutation
22825683_s8	An intronic variant , c.341‑11T&gt;A , previously regarded as of unknown function , is associated with an increased level of skipping of exon 2 and may , therefore , reduce production of pVHL .	
22825683_s9	Our data show that the biological consequences of VHL mutations are not necessarily predictable from the sequence change of the mutation and that for the majority of VHL mutations , the potential for the generation of mutant protein exists .	genomic instability and mutation
22825757_s0	Although interleukin-28A ( IL-28A ) is believed to have an antiviral effect , its role in tumor migration requires further examination .	
22825757_s1	The present study was intended to verify the effect of IL-28A on the migration of UMUC-3 bladder cancer cells .	
22825757_s2	IL-28A and its receptor IL-28AR1 mRNA were detected in UMUC-3 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22825757_s3	Although exogenous IL-28A showed no effect on cell proliferation , a wound-healing migration assay showed that the migration of UMUC-3 cells was induced by IL-28A .	
22825757_s4	Furthermore , treatment of the cells with IL-28A significantly promoted MMP-9 expression via binding activities of NF-ÎºB and AP-1 .	
22825757_s5	IL-28A also induced the activation of p38MAPK and Jak2-Stat2 signaling .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22825757_s6	Using the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and the dominant-negative plasmid DN-p38 , we found evidence that the inhibition of p38MAPK signaling suppressed the effects of IL-28A including wound-healing migration and MMP-9 expression by activation of NF-ÎºB and AP-1 binding in UMUC-3 cells .	
22825757_s7	However , Jak-2 inhibition by AG490 did not affect IL-28A-induced migration of UMUC-3 cells .	
22825757_s8	Collectively , we suggest for the first time that the p38MAPK pathway mediates IL-28A-induced cell migration through MMP-9 expression by activating NF-ÎºB and AP-1 binding motifs .	activating invasion and metastasis
22828138_s0	We have evaluated DNA damage ( DNA adduct formation ) after feeding benzo[a]pyrene ( BP ) to wild-type ( WT ) and cancer-susceptible Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice deficient in nucleotide excision repair and haploinsufficient for the tumor suppressor p53 .	
22828138_s1	DNA damage was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC/ES-MS/MS ) , which measures r7,t8,t9-trihydroxy-c-10-(N ( 2)-deoxyguanosyl)-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ( BPdG ) , and a chemiluminescence immunoassay ( CIA ) , using anti-r7,t8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ( BPDE)-DNA antiserum , which measures both BPdG and the other stable BP-DNA adducts .	
22828138_s2	When mice were fed 100 ppm BP for 28 days , BP-induced DNA damage measured in esophagus , liver and lung was typically higher in Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice , compared with WT mice .	genomic instability and mutation
22828138_s3	This result is consistent with the previously observed tumor susceptibility of Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice .	genomic instability and mutation
22828138_s4	BPdG , the major DNA adduct associated with tumorigenicity , was the primary DNA adduct formed in esophagus ( a target tissue in the mouse ) , whereas total BP-DNA adducts predominated in higher levels in the liver ( a non-target tissue in the mouse ) .	genomic instability and mutation
22828138_s5	In an attempt to lower BP-induced DNA damage , we fed the WT and Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice 0.3% chlorophyllin ( CHL ) in the BP-containing diet for 28 days .	
22828138_s6	The addition of CHL resulted in an increase of BP-DNA adducts in esophagus , liver and lung of WT mice , a lowering of BPdG in esophagi of WT mice and livers of Xpa(-/-)p53(+/-) mice and an increase of BPdG in livers of WT mice .	genomic instability and mutation
22828138_s7	Therefore , the addition of CHL to a BP-containing diet showed a lack of consistent chemoprotective effect , indicating that oral CHL administration may not reduce PAH-DNA adduct levels consistently in human organs .	genomic instability and mutation
22832494_s0	Nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) is by far the most frequent type of cancer in humans .	
22832494_s1	NMSC includes several types of malignancies with different clinical outcomes , the most frequent being basal and squamous cell carcinomas .	
22832494_s2	We have used the Sleeping Beauty transposon/transposase system to identify somatic mutations associated with NMSC .	
22832494_s3	Transgenic mice bearing multiple copies of a mutagenic Sleeping Beauty transposon T2Onc2 and expressing the SB11 transposase under the transcriptional control of regulatory elements from the keratin K5 promoter were treated with TPA , either in wild-type or Ha-ras mutated backgrounds .	
22832494_s4	After several weeks of treatment , mice with transposition developed more malignant tumors with decreased latency compared with control mice .	
22832494_s5	Transposon/transposase animals also developed basal cell carcinomas .	
22832494_s6	Genetic analysis of the transposon integration sites in the tumors identified several genes recurrently mutated in different tumor samples , which may represent novel candidate cancer genes .	
22832494_s7	We observed alterations in the expression levels of some of these genes in human tumors .	
22832494_s8	Our results show that inactivating mutations in Notch1 and Nsd1 , among others , may have an important role in skin carcinogenesis .	genomic instability and mutation
22835516_s0	A 34-year-old Japanese woman presented with left supraclavicular lymph node swelling .	
22835516_s1	Computed tomography scans revealed a mass on the left lower lobe , pulmonary nodules , and pleural effusion .	
22835516_s2	A lymph node biopsy revealed large-cell carcinoma with an epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) deletion mutation , L747-T751 in exon 19 .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
22835516_s3	Although malignant pleural effusions carried the same EGFR mutation , progressive pleural effusions after treatment with chemotherapy , gefitinib , and erlotinib did not show any EGFR mutation .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
22835516_s4	A cell line established from the pleural effusion 3 days before the patient expired also did not harbor the EGFR mutation .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
22835516_s5	Histological sections of the lymph node of the patient were similar to those of the xenograft tumor of the cell line .	
22835516_s6	There may be genetic heterogeneity in EGFR mutant tumors .	
22838389_s0	BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer is one of the main cancers in the Western world .	
22838389_s1	About 90% of the deaths arise from formation of distant metastasis .	
22838389_s2	The expression of the newly identified gene metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 ( MACC1 ) is a prognostic indicator for colon cancer metastasis .	
22838389_s3	Here , we analyzed for the first time the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the coding region of MACC1 for clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients .	
22838389_s4	Additionally , we screened met proto-oncogene ( Met ) , the transcriptional target gene of MACC1 , for mutations .	
22838389_s5	METHODS We sequenced the coding exons of MACC1 in 154 colorectal tumors ( stages I , II and III ) and the crucial exons of Met in 60 colorectal tumors ( stages I , II and III ) .	
22838389_s6	We analyzed the association of MACC1 polymorphisms with clinical data , including metachronous metastasis , UICC stages , tumor invasion , lymph node metastasis and patients ' survival ( n = 154 , stages I , II and III ) .	
22838389_s7	Furthermore , we performed biological assays in order to evaluate the functional impact of MACC1 SNPs on the motility of colorectal cancer cells .	
22838389_s8	RESULTS We genotyped three MACC1 SNPs in the coding region .	
22838389_s9	Thirteen % of the tumors had the genotype cg ( rs4721888 , L31V ) , 48% a ct genotype ( rs975263 , S515L ) and 84% a gc or cc genotype ( rs3735615 , R804T ) .	
22838389_s10	We found no association of these SNPs with clinicopathological parameters or with patients ' survival , when analyzing the entire patients ' cohort .	
22838389_s11	An increased risk for a shorter metastasis-free survival of patients with a ct genotype ( rs975263 ) was observed in younger colon cancer patients with stage I or II ( P = 0.041 , n = 18 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
22838389_s12	In cell culture , MACC1 SNPs did not affect MACC1-induced cell motility and proliferation .	
22838389_s13	CONCLUSION In summary , the identification of coding MACC1 SNPs in primary colorectal tumors does not improve the prediction for metastasis formation or for patients ' survival compared to MACC1 expression analysis alone .	activating invasion and metastasis
22838389_s14	The ct genotype ( rs975263 ) might be associated with a reduced survival for younger colon cancer patients in early stages .	
22838389_s15	However , further studies with larger sample sizes are needed .	
22840369_s0	Breast cancer includes high number of molecular entities targetable by specific agents .	
22840369_s1	In this study , array CGH and PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations were used to drive patients into targeted therapy .	
22840369_s2	A prospective molecular analysis was offered to metastatic breast cancer patients for whom samples were collected prospectively or retrospectively either from frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue .	
22840369_s3	Analyses were performed using array CGH ( Agilent platform ) and PIK3CA ( exon 10 and 21 ) and AKT1 mutations were explored by standard Sanger sequencing .	
22840369_s4	One hundred and eight patients were included .	
22840369_s5	Good quality CGH was obtained in 79% cases and was better for frozen samples .	
22840369_s6	Genomic alterations were identified in 50% of patients including 11 PIK3CA and 8 AKT1 mutations .	genomic instability and mutation
22840369_s7	Eighteen treatments ( 17 patients ) were administered according to their molecular profile with evidence of activity in nine .	
22840369_s8	Reasons for not providing a genomic-driven treatment included absence of progressive disease ( 38% ) , investigator's choice ( 9% ) , rapid PD ( 19% ) , and no drug access ( 21% ) .	
22840369_s9	Array CGH correctly identified Her2 status in 97% cases ; failures were related to low % of tumour cells .	
22840369_s10	Our study showed that array CGH is feasible in the context of daily practice and , in combination with PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations , identifies a significant number of actionable molecular alterations that allow driving patients into specific targeted agents .	genomic instability and mutation
22840462_s0	BACKGROUND : To quantify tumour angiogenesis , microvessel density ( MVD ) has been widely used .	
22840462_s1	We here present a novel angiogenesis marker , microvessel proliferation ( MVP ) , based on dual immunohistochemical staining of nestin and Ki-67 .	
22840462_s2	Immature endothelial cells express nestin , and when co-expressed with the proliferation marker Ki-67 , the number of proliferating immature blood vessels can be measured .	
22840462_s3	MATERIALS AND METHODS : Microvessel proliferation was evaluated in 178 breast cancer samples and estimated by vascular proliferation index ( VPI ) , the ratio between the number of vessels containing proliferating endothelial cells and the total number of immature vessels .	
22840462_s4	RESULTS : High VPI was strongly associated with several markers of aggressive breast cancer , such as negative oestrogen receptor ( ER ) status ( p=0.003 ) , high tumour cell proliferation by Ki-67 ( p=0.004 ) , high p53 expression ( p=0.001 ) , and five profiles for the basal-like phenotype ( odds ratios ( OR ) ; range 3.4-6.3 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22840462_s5	Also , high VPI was significantly associated with interval detected breast cancer compared with screening detected lesions ( p&lt;0.0005 ) , and adverse outcome in univariate and multivariate survival analysis ( p=0.034 and p=0.022 , respectively ) .	
22840462_s6	CONCLUSION : Microvessel proliferation is a novel marker of ongoing angiogenesis and was associated with aggressive tumour features , basal-like phenotypes , interval presentation , and prognosis in this series of breast cancer .	inducing angiogenesis
22841394_s0	Liver cancer , predominantly hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , represents a complex and fatal malignancy driven primarily by oxidative stress and inflammation .	
22841394_s1	Due to dismal prognosis and limited therapeutic intervention , chemoprevention has emerged as a viable approach to reduce the morbidity and mortality of HCC .	
22841394_s2	Pomegranate fruit is a rich source of phytochemicals endowed with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties .	
22841394_s3	We previously reported that pomegranate phytochemicals inhibit diethylnitrosamine ( DENA)-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis in rats though nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant mechanisms .	
22841394_s4	Since Nrf2 also acts as a key mediator of the nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-ÎºB)-regulated inflammatory pathway , our present study investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of a pomegranate emulsion ( PE ) during DENA-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis .	
22841394_s5	Rats were administered with PE ( 1 or 10 g/kg ) 4 weeks before and 18 weeks following DENA initiation .	
22841394_s6	There was a significant increase in hepatic expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase , 3-nitrotyrosine , heat shock protein 70 and 90 , cyclooxygenase-2 and NF-ÎºB in DENA-exposed rat livers .	
22841394_s7	PE dose-dependently suppressed all aforementioned elevated inflammatory markers .	tumor promoting inflammation
22841394_s8	A conspicuous finding of this study involves lack of cardiotoxicity of PE as assessed by monitoring cardiac function using noninvasive echocardiography .	
22841394_s9	Our results provide substantial evidence that suppression of the inflammatory cascade through modulation of NF-ÎºB signaling pathway may represent a novel mechanism of liver tumor inhibitory effects of PE against experimental hepatocarcinogenesis .	tumor promoting inflammation
22841394_s10	Data presented here coupled with those of our earlier study underline the importance of simultaneously targeting two interconnected molecular circuits , namely , Nrf2-mediated redox signaling and NF-ÎºB-regulated inflammatory pathway , by pomegranate phytoconstituents to achieve chemoprevention of HCC .	tumor promoting inflammation
22842522_s0	Bioenergetic profiling of tumors is a new challenge of cancer research and medicine as therapies are currently being developed .	
22842522_s1	Meanwhile , methodological means must be proposed to gather information on tumor metabolism in order to adapt these potential therapies to the bioenergetic specificities of tumors .	
22842522_s2	Studies performed on tumors and cancer cell lines have shown that cancer cells bioenergetics is highly variable .	
22842522_s3	This profile changes with microenvironmental conditions ( eg. substrate availability ) , the oncogenes activated ( and the tumor suppressors inactivated ) and the interaction with the stroma ( i.e. reverse Warburg effect ) .	
22842522_s4	Here , we assessed the power of metabolic footprinting ( MFP ) to unravel the bioenergetics and associated anabolic changes induced by three oncogenes , c-Myc , KLF4 and Oct1 .	
22842522_s5	The MFP approach provides a quantitative analysis of the metabolites secreted and consumed by cancer cells .	
22842522_s6	We used ultra performance liquid chromatography for quantifying the amino acid uptake and secretion .	
22842522_s7	To investigate the potential oncogene-mediated alterations in mitochondrial metabolism , we measured oxygen consumption rate and ATP production as well as the glucose uptake and lactate release .	
22842522_s8	Our findings show that c-Myc deficiency initiates the Warburg effect along with a reduction of mitochondrial respiration .	cellular energetics
22842522_s9	KLF4 deficiency also stimulated glycolysis , albeit without cellular respiration impairment .	
22842522_s10	In contrast , Oct1 deficiency reduced glycolysis and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation efficiency .	cellular energetics
22842522_s11	MFP revealed that c-Myc , KLF4 and Oct1 altered amino acid metabolism with specific patterns .	
22842522_s12	We identified isoleucine , Î±-aminoadipic acid and GABA ( Î³-aminoisobutyric acid ) as biomarkers related .	
22842522_s13	Our findings establish the impact of Oct1 , KLF4 and c-Myc on cancer bioenergetics and evidence a link between oncosecretomics and cellular bioenergetics profile .	cellular energetics
22843550_s0	Colorectal tumors are continuously exposed to an inflammatory environment , which together with mitogenic signals sustain several cancer hallmarks .	
22843550_s1	Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NFκB ) is a major regulator of inflammation and variation in NFκB-associated genes could potentially be used as biomarkers to identify patients with increased risk of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) development , and/or a rapidly progressing disease .	
22843550_s2	In this study , 348 CRC cases and 806 randomly selected healthy individuals from southeastern Sweden were examined with regard to seven polymorphisms in NFκB pathway-associated genes .	
22843550_s3	Log-rank-tests and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis examined the association between the polymorphisms and CRC-specific survival , whereas chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis were used to test for associations between the polymorphisms and CRC susceptibility .	
22843550_s4	Gene expression and loss of heterozygosity analyses of TNFAIP3 were carried out in a subset of tumors to assess its role as a tumor suppressor in CRC .	
22843550_s5	Heterozygous and polymorphic TNFAIP3 ( rs6920220 ) , heterozygous NLRP3 ( Q705K ) and polymorphic NFκB -94 ATTG ins/del genotypes were found to be associated with poorer survival in patients diagnosed with invasive CRC ( aHR = 5.2 , 95% CI : 2.5-10.9 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
22843550_s6	TNFAIP3 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in tumors compared with adjacent non-neoplastic mucosa ( P &lt ; 0.0001 ) and loss of heterozygosity of 6q23.3 ( TNFAIP3 ) was detected in 17% of cases , whereas only 2.5% of the investigated specimens displayed TNFAIP3 gene mutations .	genomic instability and mutation
22843550_s7	We propose that TNFAIP3 ( rs6920220 ) , NLRP3 ( Q705K ) and NFκB -94 ATTG ins/del polymorphisms are associated with poor survival in patients with advanced CRC and may be used as prognostic markers .	
22843550_s8	Experimental results indicate that TNFAIP3 may act as a tumor suppressor in CRC .	
22844353_s0	Interleukin-23 ( IL-23 ) plays an essential role in the mucosal immune system .	
22844353_s1	It has been suggested that IL-23 is able to induce carcinogenesis as well as inflammation and a recent study revealed that IL-23R is expressed in colorectal carcinoma cells .	
22844353_s2	However , neither the differences in the IL-23R expression among the patients nor the concrete functions of IL-23 in colorectal carcinoma cells have been revealed .	
22844353_s3	The aim of the present study was to examine the characteristics of IL-23R expression in colorectal carcinoma and the direct effects of IL-23 on colorectal cancer cells .	
22844353_s4	We examined the IL-23R expression in human colorectal cancer tissue samples by immunohistochemistry .	
22844353_s5	Cell proliferation and invasion assays under IL-23 stimulation were performed using cultured cells derived from colorectal cancer .	
22844353_s6	ELISA and real-time PCR were used to evaluate the transforming growth factor ( TGF)-Î² production due to IL-23 stimulation .	
22844353_s7	All of the TNM stage IV patients were positive for IL-23R .	
22844353_s8	IL-23R expression in the carcinoma tissue was also relatively high at the deepest point of invasion in certain cases .	
22844353_s9	The proliferative and invasive activities and/or TGF-Î² production of DLD-1 cells increased by IL-23 stimulation , whereas no change was observed in the activities of MIP101 and KM12c cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22844353_s10	IL-23 directly enhanced the malignancy of the colon carcinoma cells .	
22844353_s11	An autocrine mechanism via TGF-Î² production may underlie these effects .	
22844353_s12	IL-23 is therefore a potential target for cancer immunotherapy .	
22844353_s13	However , the homogeneity in IL-23R expression and the effects of IL-23 on colorectal carcinoma cells should be considered .	
22844452_s0	BACKGROUND To investigate the dynamics of inter- and intratumoral molecular alterations during tumor progression in recurrent gliomas .	
22844452_s1	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To address intertumoral heterogeneity we investigated non-microdissected tumor tissue of 106 gliomas representing 51 recurrent tumors .	
22844452_s2	To address intratumoral heterogeneity a set of 16 gliomas representing 7 tumor pairs with at least one recurrence , and 4 single mixed gliomas were investigated by microdissection of distinct oligodendroglial and astrocytic tumor components .	
22844452_s3	All tumors and tumor components were analyzed for allelic loss of 1p/19q ( LOH 1p/19q ) , for TP53- mutations and for R132 mutations in the IDH1 gene .	
22844452_s4	The investigation of non-microdissected tumor tissue revealed clonality in 75% ( 38/51 ) .	
22844452_s5	Aberrant molecular alterations upon recurrence were detected in 25% ( 13/51). 64% ( 9/14 ) of these were novel and associated with tumor progression .	
22844452_s6	Loss of previously detected alterations was observed in 36% ( 5/14 ) .	
22844452_s7	One tumor pair ( 1/14 ; 7% ) was significant for both .	
22844452_s8	Intratumoral clonality was detected in 57% ( 4/7 ) of the microdissected tumor pairs and in 75% ( 3/4 ) of single microdissected tumors. 43% ( 3/7 ) of tumor pairs and one single tumor ( 25% ) revealed intratumoral heterogeneity .	
22844452_s9	While intratumoral heterogeneity affected both the TP53- mutational status and the LOH1p/19q status , all tumors with intratumoral heterogeneity shared the R132 IDH1- mutation as a common feature in both their microdissected components .	genomic instability and mutation
22844452_s10	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE The majority of recurrent gliomas are of monoclonal origin .	
22844452_s11	However , the detection of divertive tumor cell clones in morphological distinct tumor components sharing IDH1- mutations as early event may provide insight into the tumorigenesis of true mixed gliomas .	genomic instability and mutation
22847613_s0	The tumor suppressor gene p53 has been implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and tumor metastasis by regulating microRNA ( miRNA ) expression .	
22847613_s1	Here , we report that mutant p53 exerts oncogenic functions and promotes EMT in endometrial cancer ( EC ) by directly binding to the promoter of miR-130b ( a negative regulator of ZEB1 ) and inhibiting its transcription .	
22847613_s2	We transduced p53 mutants into p53-null EC cells , profiled the miRNA expression by miRNA microarray and identified miR-130b as a potential target of mutant p53 .	
22847613_s3	Ectopic expression of p53 mutants repressed the expression of miR-130b and triggered ZEB1-dependent EMT and cancer cell invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
22847613_s4	Loss of an endogenous p53 mutation increased the expression of miR-130b , which resulted in reduced ZEB1 expression and attenuation of the EMT phenotype .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
22847613_s5	Furthermore , re-expression of miR-130b suppressed mutant p53-induced EMT and ZEB1 expression .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
22847613_s6	Importantly , the expression of miR-130 was significantly reduced in EC tissues , and patients with higher expression levels of miR-130b survived longer .	
22847613_s7	These data provide a novel understanding of the roles of p53 gain-of-function mutations in accelerating tumor progression and metastasis through modulation of the miR-130b-ZEB1 axis .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
22848179_s0	BACKGROUND Agricultural products and by products provide the primary materials for a variety of technological applications in diverse industrial sectors .	
22848179_s1	Agro-industrial wastes , such as cotton and curaua fibers , are used to prepare nanofibers for use in thermoplastic films , where they are combined with polymeric matrices , and in biomedical applications such as tissue engineering , amongst other applications .	
22848179_s2	The development of products containing nanofibers offers a promising alternative for the use of agricultural products , adding value to the chains of production .	
22848179_s3	However , the emergence of new nanotechnological products demands that their risks to human health and the environment be evaluated .	
22848179_s4	This has resulted in the creation of the new area of nanotoxicology , which addresses the toxicological aspects of these materials .	
22848179_s5	PURPOSE AND METHODS Contributing to these developments , the present work involved a genotoxicological study of different nanofibers , employing chromosomal aberration and comet assays , as well as cytogenetic and molecular analyses , to obtain preliminary information concerning nanofiber safety .	
22848179_s6	The methodology consisted of exposure of Allium cepa roots , and animal cell cultures ( lymphocytes and fibroblasts ) , to different types of nanofibers .	
22848179_s7	Negative controls , without nanofibers present in the medium , were used for comparison .	
22848179_s8	RESULTS The nanofibers induced different responses according to the cell type used .	
22848179_s9	In plant cells , the most genotoxic nanofibers were those derived from green , white , and brown cotton , and curaua , while genotoxicity in animal cells was observed using nanofibers from brown cotton and curaua .	genomic instability and mutation
22848179_s10	An important finding was that ruby cotton nanofibers did not cause any significant DNA breaks in the cell types employed .	genomic instability and mutation
22848179_s11	CONCLUSION This work demonstrates the feasibility of determining the genotoxic potential of nanofibers derived from plant cellulose to obtain information vital both for the future usage of these materials in agribusiness and for an understanding of their environmental impacts .	genomic instability and mutation
22848758_s0	22Rv1 is a common prostate cancer cell line used in xenograft mouse experiments as well as in vitro cell culture assays to study aspects of prostate cancer tumorigenesis .	
22848758_s1	Recently , this cell line was shown to harbor multiple copies of a gammaretrovirus , called XMRV , integrated in its genome .	
22848758_s2	While the original prostate cancer xenograft CWR22 is free of any retrovirus , subsequently generated cell lines 22Rv1 and CWR-R1 , carry this virus and additionally shed infectious gammaretroviral particles in their supernatant .	
22848758_s3	Although XMRV most likely was generated by recombination events in cell culture this virus has been demonstrated to infect human cells in vitro and 22Rv1 as well as CWR-R1 cells are now considered biosafety 2 reagents .	
22848758_s4	Here , we demonstrate that 22Rv1 cells with reduced retroviral transcription show reduced tumor angiogenesis and increased necrosis of the primary tumor derived from xenografted cells in scid mice when compared to the parental cell line .	inducing angiogenesis,resisting cell death
22848758_s5	The presence of XMRV transcripts significantly increases secretion of osteopontin ( OPN ) , CXCL14 , IL13 and TIMP2 in 22Rv1 cells .	
22848758_s6	Furthermore , these data are supported by in vitro cell invasion and differentiation assays .	activating invasion and metastasis
22848758_s7	Collectively , our data suggest that the presence of XMRV transcripts at least partially contributes to 22Rv1 characteristics observed in vitro and in vivo with regard to migration , invasion and tumor angiogenesis .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
22848758_s8	We propose that data received with 22Rv1 cells or equivalent cells carrying xenotropic gammaretroviruses should be carefully controlled including other prostate cancer cell lines tested for viral sequences .	
22850877_s0	Metastatic cancer is extremely difficult to treat , and the presence of metastases greatly reduces a cancer patient's likelihood of long-term survival .	
22850877_s1	The ZEB1 transcriptional repressor promotes metastasis through downregulation of microRNAs ( miRs ) that are strong inducers of epithelial differentiation and inhibitors of stem cell factors .	
22850877_s2	Given that each miR can target multiple genes with diverse functions , we posited that the prometastatic network controlled by ZEB1 extends beyond these processes .	
22850877_s3	We tested this hypothesis using a mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma metastasis driven by ZEB1 , human lung carcinoma cells , and human breast carcinoma cells .	
22850877_s4	Transcriptional profiling studies revealed that ZEB1 controls the expression of numerous oncogenic and tumor-suppressive miRs , including miR-34a .	
22850877_s5	Ectopic expression of miR-34a decreased tumor cell invasion and metastasis , inhibited the formation of promigratory cytoskeletal structures , suppressed activation of the RHO GTPase family , and regulated a gene expression signature enriched in cytoskeletal functions and predictive of outcome in human lung adenocarcinomas .	activating invasion and metastasis
22850877_s6	We identified several miR-34a target genes , including Arhgap1 , which encodes a RHO GTPase activating protein that was required for tumor cell invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
22850877_s7	These findings demonstrate that ZEB1 drives prometastatic actin cytoskeletal remodeling by downregulating miR-34a expression and provide a compelling rationale to develop miR-34a as a therapeutic agent in lung cancer patients .	
22851646_s0	Identifying genomic alterations driving breast cancer is complicated by tumor diversity and genetic heterogeneity .	
22851646_s1	Relevant mouse models are powerful for untangling this problem because such heterogeneity can be controlled .	
22851646_s2	Inbred Chaos3 mice exhibit high levels of genomic instability leading to mammary tumors that have tumor gene expression profiles closely resembling mature human mammary luminal cell signatures .	
22851646_s3	We genomically characterized mammary adenocarcinomas from these mice to identify cancer-causing genomic events that overlap common alterations in human breast cancer .	
22851646_s4	Chaos3 tumors underwent recurrent copy number alterations ( CNAs ) , particularly deletion of the RAS inhibitor Neurofibromin 1 ( Nf1 ) in nearly all cases .	
22851646_s5	These overlap with human CNAs including NF1 , which is deleted or mutated in 27.7% of all breast carcinomas .	genomic instability and mutation
22851646_s6	Chaos3 mammary tumor cells exhibit RAS hyperactivation and increased sensitivity to RAS pathway inhibitors .	
22851646_s7	These results indicate that spontaneous NF1 loss can drive breast cancer .	
22851646_s8	This should be informative for treatment of the significant fraction of patients whose tumors bear NF1 mutations .	genomic instability and mutation
22858678_s0	The metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 , MALAT1 , is a long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA ) that has been discovered as a marker for lung cancer metastasis .	
22858678_s1	It is highly abundant , its expression is strongly regulated in many tumor entities including lung adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as physiological processes , and it is associated with many RNA binding proteins and highly conserved throughout evolution .	
22858678_s2	The nuclear transcript MALAT-1 has been functionally associated with gene regulation and alternative splicing and its regulation has been shown to impact proliferation , apoptosis , migration and invasion .	
22858678_s3	Here , we have developed a human and a mouse knockout system to study the loss-of-function phenotypes of this important ncRNA .	
22858678_s4	In human tumor cells , MALAT1 expression was abrogated using Zinc Finger Nucleases .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22858678_s5	Unexpectedly , the quantitative loss of MALAT1 did neither affect proliferation nor cell cycle progression nor nuclear architecture in human lung or liver cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22858678_s6	Moreover , genetic loss of Malat1 in a knockout mouse model did not give rise to any obvious phenotype or histological abnormalities in Malat1-null compared with wild-type animals .	
22858678_s7	Thus , loss of the abundant nuclear long ncRNA MALAT1 is compatible with cell viability and normal development .	
22858906_s0	FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3 ) normally functions in the survival/proliferation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells , but its constitutive activation by internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) mutations correlates with a poor prognosis in AML .	
22858906_s1	The development of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI ) is a promising strategy , but resistance that arises during the course of treatment caused by secondary mutations within the mutated gene itself poses a significant challenge .	
22858906_s2	In an effort to predict FLT3 resistance mutations that might develop in patients , we used saturation mutagenesis of FLT3/ITD followed by selection of transfected cells in FLT3 TKI .	
22858906_s3	We identified F621L , A627P , F691L and Y842C mutations in FLT3/ITD that confer varying levels of resistance to FLT3 TKI .	genomic instability and mutation
22858906_s4	Western blotting confirmed that some FLT3 TKI were ineffective at inhibiting FLT3 autophosphorylation and signaling through MAP kinase , STAT5 and AKT in some mutants .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22858906_s5	Balb/c mice transplanted with the FLT3/ITD Y842C mutation confirmed resistance to sorafenib in vivo but not to lestaurtinib .	
22858906_s6	These results indicate a growing number of FLT3 mutations that are likely to be encountered in patients .	genomic instability and mutation
22858906_s7	Such knowledge , combined with known remaining sensitivity to other FLT3 TKI , will be important to establish as secondary drug treatments that can be substituted when these mutants are encountered .	
22859269_s0	Increasing evidence shows that estrogens are involved in lung cancer proliferation and progression , and most human lung tumors express estrogen receptor Î² ( ERÎ² ) as well as aromatase .	
22859269_s1	To determine if the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole prevents development of lung tumors induced by a tobacco carcinogen , alone or in combination with the ER antagonist fulvestrant , ovariectomized female mice received treatments with the tobacco carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone ( NNK ) along with daily supplements of androstenedione , the substrate for aromatase .	
22859269_s2	Placebo , anastrozole and/or fulvestrant were administered in both an initiation and a promotion protocol of lung tumorigenesis .	
22859269_s3	The combination of fulvestrant and anastrozole given during NNK exposure resulted in significantly fewer NNK-induced lung tumors ( mean = 0.5 ) compared with placebo ( mean = 4.6 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) , fulvestrant alone ( mean = 3.4 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) or anastrozole alone ( mean = 2.8 , P = 0.002 ) .	
22859269_s4	A significantly lower Ki67 cell proliferation index was also observed compared with single agent and control treatment groups .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22859269_s5	Beginning antiestrogen treatment after NNK exposure , when preneoplastic lesions had already formed , also yielded maximum antitumor effects with the combination .	
22859269_s6	Aromatase expression was found mainly in macrophages infiltrating preneoplastic and tumorous areas of the lungs , whereas ERÎ² was found in both macrophages and tumor cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22859269_s7	Antiestrogens , especially in combination , effectively inhibited tobacco carcinogen-induced murine lung tumorigenesis and may have application for lung cancer prevention .	
22859269_s8	An important source of estrogen synthesis may be inflammatory cells that infiltrate the lungs in response to carcinogens , beginning early in the carcinogenesis process .	
22859269_s9	ERÎ² expressed by inflammatory and neoplastic epithelial cells in the lung may signal in response to local estrogen production .	
22859959_s0	A glycolytic profile unifies a group of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas ( PHEOs/PGLs ) with distinct underlying gene defects , including von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) and succinate dehydrogenase B ( SDHB ) mutations .	
22859959_s1	Nevertheless , their tumor aggressiveness is distinct : PHEOs/PGLs metastasize rarely in VHL- , but frequently in SDHB-patients .	
22859959_s2	To date , the molecular mechanisms causing the more aggressive phenotype in SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs remain largely unknown .	
22859959_s3	Recently , however , an excellent model to study aggressive PHEOs ( mouse tumor tissue ( MTT ) cells ) has been developed from mouse PHEO cells ( MPC ) .	
22859959_s4	We employed this model for a proteomics based approach to identify changes characteristic for tumor aggressiveness , which we then explored in a homogeneous set of human SDHB- and VHL-PHEOs/PGLs .	
22859959_s5	The increase of glucose transporter 1 in VHL , and of hexokinase 2 in VHL and SDHB , confirmed their glycolytic profile .	cellular energetics
22859959_s6	In agreement with the cell model and in support of decoupling of glycolysis , the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) , SDHB tumors showed increased lactate dehydrogenase levels .	cellular energetics
22859959_s7	In SDHB-PGLs OXPHOS complex activity was increased at complex III and , as expected , decreased at complex II .	
22859959_s8	Moreover , protein and mRNA expression of all tested OXPHOS-related genes were higher in SDHB- than in VHL-derived tumors .	
22859959_s9	Although there was no direct evidence for increased reactive oxygen species production , elevated superoxide dismutase 2 expression may reflect elevated oxidative stress in SDHB-derived PHEOs/PGLs .	tumor promoting inflammation
22859959_s10	For the first time , we show that despite dysfunction in complex II and evidence for a glycolytic phenotype , the Warburg effect does not seem to fully apply to SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs with respect to decreased OXPHOS .	cellular energetics
22859959_s11	In addition , we present evidence for increased LDHA and SOD2 expression in SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs , proteins that have been proposed as promising therapeutic targets in other cancers .	
22859959_s12	This study provides new insight into pathogenic mechanisms in aggressive human PHEOs/PGLs , which may lead to identifying new diagnostic and prognostic markers in the near future .	
22864932_s0	BACKGROUND To assess the potential mechanisms that may underlie increased local failure in triple negative ( TN ) breast cancers , an analysis was performed of the risk of residual carcinoma after lumpectomy with correlation to pathologic factors , including molecular phenotype .	
22864932_s1	METHODS A review of pathologic specimens was performed for women with invasive breast cancer treated with lumpectomy followed by reexcision .	
22864932_s2	Data were collected on age ; tumor size , grade , and nodal stage ; estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , and human endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( Her2 ) ; extensive intraductal component ; lymphovascular invasion ; margins ; and reexcision findings .	
22864932_s3	Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate for associations between pathologic features of the lumpectomy specimen and reexcision findings .	
22864932_s4	Molecular phenotypes were defined by conventionally used immunohistochemical pattern .	
22864932_s5	RESULTS Data were collected on 369 patients with breast cancer .	
22864932_s6	The median age was 57 years , median tumor size was 1.5 cm , 36% had positive margins , 32% had positive lymph nodes , 73.5% had the luminal A subtype , 9.5% had the luminal B subtype , 4.5% were Her2-enriched , and 12.5% were TN .	
22864932_s7	Overall , 32% of patients had invasive cancer in their reexcision specimens , and 51% of those with the TN subtype had residual invasive disease on reexcision compared with 30% to 31% for other subtypes .	activating invasion and metastasis
22864932_s8	On univariate analysis , age , tumor size , margin status , lymphovascular invasion , nodal status , and TN subtype were associated with elevated risk of residual invasive cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis
22864932_s9	On multivariate analysis using a forward stepwise model , TN subtype maintained significance , with an odds ratio of 3.28 ( P = .002 ) .	
22864932_s10	CONCLUSION TN subtype has a statistically significant association with an increased risk of residual tumor .	
22864932_s11	This suggests the putative increase in the risk of local failure in TN patients may be related to increased residual tumor burden .	
22867999_s0	The role of energy deregulation and altered/adapted metabolism in tumor cells is an increasingly important issue in understanding cancer .	
22867999_s1	Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma ( HLRCC ) is an aggressive form of RCC characterized by germline mutation of fumarate hydratase ( FH ) , followed by somatic loss of the remaining wild-type allele and known to be a highly metastatic and lethal malignancy compared to other RCCs .	
22867999_s2	The intrinsic loss of normal tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle presumably aids tumorigenesis due to the necessary metabolic alterations required and the enforced dependence on glycolysis derived energy , mimicking the Warburg effect .	
22867999_s3	Thus , there is considerable utility in establishing a preclinical cell model from these tumors to study energy metabolism deregulation , as well as developing new targeted therapeutic approaches for TCA cycle enzyme-deficient cancers .	
22867999_s4	Here , we describe a new immortalized cell line , UOK268 , derived from a patient's primary HLRCC-associated kidney cancer .	
22867999_s5	This represents the first primary renal cell line to model TCA cycle gene loss and provides a perfect partner cell line to our previously described metastasis-derived HLRCC-associated cell line , UOK262 .	
22867999_s6	We identified a novel germline FH missense mutation , p.His192Asp , and the subsequent loss of heterozygosity in UOK268 .	genomic instability and mutation
22867999_s7	The UOK268 cell line expressed mutant FH protein , which localized to the mitochondria , but with loss of almost all catalytic activity .	
22867999_s8	The UOK268 cells had severely compromised oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolytic flux .	cellular energetics
22867999_s9	Ingenuity pathways analysis of human mitochondria-focused cDNA microarray ( hMitChip3 ) gene chip data confirmed the altered mRNA expression patterns of genes involved in several important pathways , such as lipid metabolism , apoptosis , and energy production/glycolysis .	cellular energetics,resisting cell death
22867999_s10	UOK268 provides a unique model of a primary cell line demonstrating an enforced , irreversible Warburg effect and , combined with UOK262 , provides a unique invitro preclinical model for studying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer .	cellular energetics
22876288_s0	Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) is an important mediator of extracellular matrix integrin signaling , cell motility , cell proliferation and cell survival .	
22876288_s1	Increased FAK expression is observed in a variety of solid human tumors and increased FAK expression and activity frequently correlate with metastatic disease and poor prognosis .	
22876288_s2	Herein we identify miR-7 as a direct regulator of FAK expression. miR-7 expression is decreased in malignant versus normal breast tissue and its expression correlates inversely with metastasis in human breast cancer patients .	
22876288_s3	Forced expression of miR-7 produced increased E-CADHERIN and decreased FIBRONECTIN and VIMENTIN expression in breast cancer cells .	
22876288_s4	The levels of miR-7 expression was positively correlated with E-CADHERIN mRNA and negatively correlated with VIMENTIN mRNA levels in breast cancer samples .	
22876288_s5	Forced expression of miR-7 in aggressive breast cancer cell lines suppressed tumor cell monolayer proliferation , anchorage independent growth , three-dimensional growth in Matrigel , migration and invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
22876288_s6	Conversely , inhibition of miR-7 in the HBL-100 mammary epithelial cell line promoted cell proliferation and anchorage independent growth .	
22876288_s7	Rescue of FAK expression reversed miR-7 suppression of migration and invasion. miR-7 also inhibited primary breast tumor development , local invasion and metastatic colonization of breast cancer xenografts .	activating invasion and metastasis
22876288_s8	Thus , miR-7 expression is decreased in metastatic breast cancer , correlates with the level of epithelial differentiation of the tumor and inhibits metastatic progression .	activating invasion and metastasis
22883469_s0	Both the deregulation of microRNAs and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) are emerging as important factors in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .	
22883469_s1	Here , miR-133b was found to be associated with tumor stage , the extent of regional lymph node involvement , stage , visceral pleura or vessel invasion and EGFR mRNA expression in Chinese patients with NSCLC .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22883469_s2	Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-133b can interact specifically with the 3'-UTR of EGFR mRNA .	
22883469_s3	Functionally , miR-133b transfection showed regulatory activity in translationally repressing EGFR mRNA .	
22883469_s4	Moreover , miR-133b transfection may modulate apoptosis , invasion and sensitivity to EGFR-TKI through the EGFR signaling pathways , especially in EGFR-addicted NSCLC cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22883469_s5	Taken together , our findings show that miR-133b can inhibit cell growth of NSCLC through targeting EGFR and regulating its downstream signaling pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22883469_s6	This finding has important implications for the development of targeted therapeutics for a number of EGFR-addicted cancers .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22888341_s0	Objective .	
22888341_s1	The present study was performed to investigate the effect of N-desulfated heparin on basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) expression , tumor angiogenesis and metastasis of gastric carcinoma .	
22888341_s2	Methods .	
22888341_s3	Human gastric cancer SGC-7901 tissues were orthotopically implanted into the stomach of NOD SCID mice .	
22888341_s4	Twenty mice were randomly divided into two groups which received either intravenous injection of 0.9% NaCl solution ( normal saline group ) or 10âmg/kg N-desulfated heparin ( N-desulfated heparin group ) twice weekly for three weeks .	
22888341_s5	In vitro , human gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells were treated with N-desulfated heparin in different concentration ( 0.1âmg/mL , 1âmg/mL , N-desulfated heparin group ) , and treated with medium ( control group ) .	
22888341_s6	Results .	
22888341_s7	In vivo , the tumor metastasis rates were 9/10 in normal saline group and 2/10 in N-desulfated heparin group ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
22888341_s8	The intratumoral microvessel density was higher in normal saline group than in N-desulfated heparin group ( P &lt ; 0.05). bFGF expression in gastric tissue was inhibited by N-desulfated heparin ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
22888341_s9	There was no bleeding in N-desulfated heparin group .	
22888341_s10	In vitro , N-desulfated heparin inhibited significantly bFGF protein and mRNA expression of gastric carcinoma cells ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
22888341_s11	Conclusions .	
22888341_s12	N-desulfated heparin can inhibit the metastasis of gastric cancer through inhibiting tumor bFGF expression and tumor angiogenesis with no obvious anticoagulant activity .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
22889480_s0	OBJECTIVES Lymph node metastasis is among the most important prognostic factors for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after curative esophagectomy ; however , the extent of lymphadenectomy is still controversial .	
22889480_s1	The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency of lymphatic metastases and to study the pattern of lymph node metastasis in a large study population .	
22889480_s2	METHODS The data from 1361 patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent curative R0 esophagectomy were retrospectively examined .	
22889480_s3	Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with lymph node metastasis .	
22889480_s4	RESULTS Of the 1361 patients , 714 ( 52.5% ) were found to have lymph node metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22889480_s5	The frequency of lymph node metastasis increased as the tumor invasion increased .	activating invasion and metastasis
22889480_s6	Paratracheal nodes were the most frequent metastasis nodes ( 15.9% ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
22889480_s7	The frequency of lymph node metastasis was 9.8% in the neck , 18.0% in the upper mediastinum , 18.9% in the middle mediastinum , 11.8% in the lower mediastinum , and 28.4% in the abdomen .	activating invasion and metastasis
22889480_s8	Of these 714 patients , 424 ( 31.2% ) presented with 1 field involvement , 255 ( 18.7% ) with 2 fields , and 35 ( 2.6% ) with 3 fields involvement .	
22889480_s9	Logistic regression analysis revealed tumor length ( P&lt;.001 ) , tumor invasion ( P&lt;.001 ) , tumor differentiation ( P=.003 ) , and lymphovascular invasion ( P&lt;.001 ) were risk factors for lymph node metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22889480_s10	Tumor location ( P&lt;.001 ) , tumor invasion ( P=.003 ) , lymphovascular invasion ( P=.004 ) , and paratracheal lymph node involvement ( P=.002 ) were identified as risk factors for cervical lymph node metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22889480_s11	CONCLUSIONS Metastases were more frequent in the abdomen than in the neck .	activating invasion and metastasis
22889480_s12	Total mediastinal and upper abdominal lymphadenectomy should be carefully conducted .	
22889480_s13	Certain factors , such as tumor location , depth of tumor invasion , lymphovascular invasion , and paratracheal lymph node involvement , might be helpful in determining the need to perform cervical lymphadenectomy in individual patients .	
22891289_s0	MDSCs and Tregs play an essential role in the immunosuppressive networks that contribute to tumor-immune evasion .	
22891289_s1	The mechanisms by which tumors promote the expansion and/or function of these suppressive cells and the cross-talk between MDSC and Treg remain incompletely defined .	
22891289_s2	Previous reports have suggested that MDSC may contribute to Treg induction in cancer .	
22891289_s3	Herein , we provide evidence that tumor-induced gr-MDSCs , endowed with the potential of suppressing conventional T Lc , surprisingly impair TGF-Î²1-mediated generation of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) iTregs .	avoiding immune destruction,sustaining proliferative signaling
22891289_s4	Furthermore , gr-MDSCs impede the proliferation of nTregs without , however , affecting FoxP3 expression .	
22891289_s5	Suppression of iTreg differentiation from naï¿½ve CD4(+) cells by gr-MDSC occurs early in the polarization process , requires inhibition of early T cell activation , and depends on ROS and IDO but does not require arginase 1 , iNOS , NO , cystine/cysteine depletion , PD-1 and PD-L1 signaling , or COX-2 .	
22891289_s6	These findings thus indicate that gr-MDSCs from TB hosts have the unanticipated ability to restrict immunosuppressive Tregs .	avoiding immune destruction
22893470_s0	BACKGROUND Cholangiocarcinoma , a type of malignant tumor , originates from epithelial cells of the bile duct .	
22893470_s1	Perineural invasion is common path for cholangiocarcinoma metastasis , and it is highly correlated with postoperative recurrence and poor prognosis .	
22893470_s2	It has been reported that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 ( mAChR M3 ) is widely expressed in digestive tract cancer , and may play an important role in the proliferation , differentiation , transformation and carcinogenesis of tumors .	
22893470_s3	This study was to explore the effect of mAChR M3 on the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells in vitro and provide a new approach to the pathogenesis and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma .	
22893470_s4	METHODS Streptavidin-biotin complex immunohistochemistry was carried out to assess the expression of mAChR M3 in surgical specimens of cholangiocarcinomas ( 40 cases ) and normal bile duct tissues ( 9 ) , as well as to investigate nerve infiltration .	
22893470_s5	The cholangiocarcinoma cells were treated with different concentrations of selective M-receptor agonist pilocarpine and M-receptor blocker atropine sulfate to induce changes in cell proliferation .	
22893470_s6	The experimental data were analyzed by the Chi-square test .	
22893470_s7	RESULTS The strongly-positive expression rate of mAChR M3 was much higher in poorly-differentiated ( 69% , 9/13 ) than in well- and moderately-differentiated cholangiocarcinomas ( 30% , 8/27 ) ( X2=5.631 , P&lt;0.05 ) .	
22893470_s8	The strongly-positive mAChR M3 expression rate in hilar cholangiocarcinoma ( 50% , 14/28 ) was higher than that in cholangiocarcinomas from the middle and lower common bile duct ( 25% , 3/12 ) ( X2=2.148 , P&lt;0.05 ) .	
22893470_s9	Cholangiocarcinomas with distant metastasis had a strongly-positive expression rate ( 75% , 9/12 ) , which was much higher than those without distant metastasis ( 29% , 8/28 ) ( X2=7.410 , P&lt;0.01 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
22893470_s10	The absorbance value in the pilocarpine+atropine group was significantly higher than the corresponding value in the pilocarpine group .	
22893470_s11	CONCLUSIONS The expression of mAChR M3 is influenced by the extent of differentiation , distant metastasis and the site of cholangiocarcinoma .	activating invasion and metastasis
22893470_s12	It also plays a key role in the proliferation and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma .	activating invasion and metastasis
22895557_s0	Colorectal cancer represents one of the most challenging diseases .	
22895557_s1	Increasing evidence indicates that aberrant expression of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) is related to pathogenesis of colorectal cancer .	
22895557_s2	Cancer cells reprogram metabolic pathways to sustain higher proliferation rates .	
22895557_s3	Whether mechanisms underlying the role of miRNA in colorectal cancer are involved in metabolic reprogramming and the mechanisms through which miRNAs alter cancer metabolism are as yet unknown .	
22895557_s4	Herein , we show that miR-124 , miR-137 and miR-340 are associated with poor prognosis of colorectal cancer .	
22895557_s5	Expression of these miRNAs inhibits the growth of colorectal cancer cells .	
22895557_s6	PKM ( pyruvate kinase isozyme ) alternative splicing proteins ( PTB1/hnRNAPA1/hnRNAPA2 ) , which control the inclusion of exon 9 ( PKM1 ) or exon 10 ( PKM2 ) , are targeted by miR-124 , miR-137 and miR-340 .	
22895557_s7	Consequently , miR-124 , miR-137 and miR-340 switch PKM gene expression from PKM2 to PKM1 .	
22895557_s8	High ratios of PKM1/PKM2 inhibit the glycolysis rate , but elevate the glucose flux into oxidative phosphorylation .	cellular energetics
22895557_s9	These results demonstrate that miRNAs ( miR-124 , miR-137 and miR-340 ) impair colorectal cancer growth by counteracting the Warburg effect due to regulating alternative splicing of the PKM gene .	cellular energetics
22895682_s0	Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) are generally used in tissue engineering , regenerative medicine and therapy for immune disorder disease .	
22895682_s1	MSCs are also employed as drug carriers for tumor therapy due to their ability to migrate to tumor tissue .	
22895682_s2	However , due to the immunosuppressive function of MSCs , the application of MSCs in prostate cancer therapy remains limited .	
22895682_s3	In this study , we investigated the underlying mechanism by which MSCs enable prostate cancer cells to escape from immune surveillance in the inflammatory microenvironment .	
22895682_s4	Firstly , we demonstrated that compared with the control groups , MSCs pretreated with IL-1Î± effectively promoted the growth of the mouse prostate cancer cell line RM-1 invivo .	
22895682_s5	Furthermore , when RM-1 prostate cancer cells were co-injected with MSCs pretreated with IL-1Î± , tumor incidence significantly increased in allogeneic recipients .	
22895682_s6	In addition , we investigated the mechanism through which MSCs promote the ability of RM-1 cells to escape from immune injury .	
22895682_s7	The results revealed that IL-1Î± led to the upregulation of TGF-Î² in MSCs .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22895682_s8	The inflammatory cytokine-induced promotive effect of MSCs on RM-1 cells in vivo was inhibited by TGF-Î² siRNA .	tumor promoting inflammation
22895682_s9	The results of our study suggest that inflammatory cytokines induce the immunosuppressive function of MSCs which enables prostate cancer cells to escape from immune injury .	avoiding immune destruction,tumor promoting inflammation
22895699_s0	Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal and common malignant human brain tumors , with aggressive proliferation and highly invasive properties .	
22895699_s1	Honokiol derived from Magnolia officinalis is able to cross the blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier ( BCSFB ) , suggesting a strong possibility that it could be an effective drug for the treatment of brain tumors , including glioblastoma .	
22895699_s2	Thus , we investigated the effects of honokiol on the expression of adhesion molecules in TNF-Î±-stimulated endothelial cells , and cancer growth and invasion were determined in T98G human glioblastoma cells .	
22895699_s3	Honokiol dose-dependently inhibited the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1 ) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) stimulated with TNF-Î± for 6 h .	
22895699_s4	Pretreatment with honokiol significantly reduced the adhesion of T98G cells to HUVECs .	
22895699_s5	Moreover , honokiol inhibited the invasion of T98G cells , suggesting that honokiol has an anti-metastatic effect .	activating invasion and metastasis
22895699_s6	In addition , honokiol increased the cytotoxicity of T98G cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner as assayed by MTT .	
22895699_s7	TUNEL assay showed that honokiol significantly induced apoptosis in T98G cells at doses of 10 ï¿½M or more .	resisting cell death
22895699_s8	The induction of apoptotic cell death was mediated by the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax .	resisting cell death
22895699_s9	Taken together , the results of this study suggest that honokiol exerts an anticancer effect by preventing metastasis and inducing apoptotic cell death of brain tumor cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
22903612_s0	The insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) pathway represents one of the most studied molecular regulatory networks in oncology .	
22903612_s1	Clinical trials investigating the therapeutic value of anti-IGF1 receptor ( IGF1R ) therapies in cancer , including prostate cancer , are ongoing .	
22903612_s2	However , the multiple functions of the IGF network in the prostate are not entirely known .	
22903612_s3	To elucidate the effects of IGF and insulin ( INS ) on prostate cells , we stimulated prostate cancer ( PC3 , DU145 , LNCaP , DUCaP ) and noncancerous prostate cells ( EP156T , RWPE-1 ) and observed differing responses : whereas cancer cells responded to IGF and INS exposure by way of enhanced cell proliferation and glucose consumption , basal to luminal differentiation was induced in noncancerous cells .	
22903612_s4	The same diverse responses were observed when the growth factor receptors IGF1R or INSR were overexpressed .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22903612_s5	Down-regulation of IGF1R or INSR isoform A ( INSRA ) also inhibited only proliferation of cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22903612_s6	The proliferative response induced by the INSR in cancer cells was mediated solely by the INSRA .	
22903612_s7	Moreover we observed that the receptors of the IGF network mutually influence their expression and exert redundant functions , thus underscoring the functional molecular network formed by IGF , INS , IGF1R , and INSR .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22903612_s8	Collectively we found that both IGF1R and INSRA have oncogenic effects in prostate cancer , but the IGF network also has important physiological functions in the noncancerous prostate .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22903612_s9	These data provide new insights into the biology of the IGF network in the prostate , thereby facilitating the design and interpretation of clinical studies investigating IGF1R targeting agents .	
22909360_s0	BACKGROUND Although basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) is the most common type of skin cancer , the incidence of metastasis is exceedingly low .	
22909360_s1	OBJECTIVE Case presentation of a basal cell carcinoma arising on the dorsum of the foot with inguinal and pelvic lymph node metastases .	
22909360_s2	METHOD Case presentation with literature review .	
22909360_s3	RESULT On the basis of our review of Japanese literature , the risk factors for BCC metastasis are occurrence on the genitalia , diameter of more than 3 cm , deep invasion of tumor cells into extradermal structures , and infiltrative/morpheic histological type .	activating invasion and metastasis
22909360_s4	CONCLUSION Although metastasis from BCC is extremely rare , the prognosis of metastatic BCC is often poor .	
22909360_s5	Careful follow-up is recommended in cases with high risk factors .	
22913657_s0	Hesperetin , a flavonoid from citrus fruits , has several bioactivities such as anti-inflammatory , antihypertensive , antiatherogenic effects .	
22913657_s1	However , studies elucidating the role and the mechanism(s) of action of hesperetin in cervical cancer are sparse .	
22913657_s2	In this study , we investigated the mechanism of the antiproliferative and apoptotic actions exerted by hesperetin on human cervical cancer SiHa cells .	
22913657_s3	The viability of SiHa cells was evaluated using the MTT assay , apoptosis by acridine orange/ethidium bromide , propidium iodide , TUNEL assay , and Annexin V-Cy3 , cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial transmembrane potential using flow cytometry , and apoptotic marker genes using quantitative real-time PCR .	
22913657_s4	The treatment of SiHa cells with hesperetin ( IC(50,) 650Î¼m ) showed a marked concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation and induced the G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner after 24h .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22913657_s5	There was an attenuation of mitochondrial membrane potential with increased expression of caspase-3 , caspase-8 , caspase-9 , p53 , Bax , and Fas death receptor and its adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain-containing protein ( FADD ) , indicating the participation of both death receptor- and mitochondria-related mechanisms .	resisting cell death
22913657_s6	Furthermore , hesperetin-induced apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL and Annexin V-Cy3 .	resisting cell death
22913657_s7	This study shows that hesperetin exhibits a potential anticancer activity against human cervical cancer cell lines in vitro through the reduction in cell viability and the induction of apoptosis .	resisting cell death
22913657_s8	Altogether , these data sustain our contention that hesperetin has anticancer properties and merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent .	
22916133_s0	Placental Growth Factor ( PGF ) is a key molecule in angiogenesis .	
22916133_s1	Several studies have revealed an important role of PGF primarily in pathological conditions ( e.g. : ischaemia , tumour formation , cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory processes ) suggesting its use as a potential therapeutic agent .	
22916133_s2	However , to date , no information is available regarding the genetics of PGF variability .	
22916133_s3	Furthermore , even though the effect of environmental factors ( e.g. : cigarette smoking ) on angiogenesis has been explored , no data on the influence of these factors on PGF levels have been reported so far .	
22916133_s4	Here we have first investigated PGF variability in two cohorts focusing on non-genetic risk factors : a study sample from two isolated villages in the Cilento region , South Italy ( N=871 ) and a replication sample from the general Danish population ( N=1,812 ) .	
22916133_s5	A significant difference in PGF mean levels was found between the two cohorts .	inducing angiogenesis
22916133_s6	However , in both samples , we observed a strong correlation of PGF levels with ageing and sex , men displaying PGF levels significantly higher than women .	inducing angiogenesis
22916133_s7	Interestingly , smoking was also found to influence the trait in the two populations , although differently .	
22916133_s8	We have then focused on genetic risk factors .	
22916133_s9	The association between five single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) located in the PGF gene and the plasma levels of the protein was investigated .	
22916133_s10	Two polymorphisms ( rs11850328 and rs2268614 ) were associated with the PGF plasma levels in the Cilento sample and these associations were strongly replicated in the Danish sample .	
22916133_s11	These results , for the first time , support the hypothesis of the presence of genetic and environmental factors influencing PGF plasma variability .	
22921746_s0	Curcumin ( diferuloylmethane ) is a polyphenol derived from the plant turmeric ( Curcuma longa ) , which is commonly used as a spice .	
22921746_s1	Although anti-carcinogenic , anti-oxidant , anti-inflammation , and anti-angiogenic properties have been reported , the effect of curcumin on breast cancer metastasis is unknown .	
22921746_s2	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) is a major component in cancer cell invasion .	
22921746_s3	In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effect of curcumin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion and the molecular mechanisms involved in MCF-7 cells .	
22921746_s4	Our results showed that curcumin inhibits TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion through suppressing NF-ÎºB and AP-1 activation .	activating invasion and metastasis
22921746_s5	Also , curcumin strongly repressed the TPA-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK and inhibited TPA-induced translocation of PKCÎ± from the cytosol to the membrane , but did not affect the translocation of PKCÎ´ .	
22921746_s6	These results indicate that curcumin-mediated inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion involves the suppression of the PKCÎ± , MAPK and NF-ÎºB/AP-1 pathway in MCF-7 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22921746_s7	Curcumin may have potential value in restricting breast cancer metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22926658_s0	BACKGROUND Angiogenesis plays an important role in the progression of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) .	
22926658_s1	Studies have indicated vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) is the predominant angiogenic factor .	
22926658_s2	Cyclin D1 ( CCND1 ) induces production of VEGF and is required for migration of blood vessels .	
22926658_s3	Our aim was to determine the roles of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression in CRC patients .	
22926658_s4	METHODS We analyzed clinicopathological features , VEGF and CCND1 expressions by immunohistochemical ( IHC ) staining in 100 stage I-III CRC patients ( 44 were postoperative relapsed ; 56 were postoperative non-relapsed ) to determine the correlation between clinicopathologic features and co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF .	
22926658_s5	Furthermore , the clinical outcomes of co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF were investigated .	
22926658_s6	RESULTS Multivariate analysis showed vascular invasion ( P = 0.019 ) , VEGF overexpression ( P = 0.033 ) , and high postoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) levels ( P = 0.022 ) were independent predictors of postoperative relapse .	inducing angiogenesis
22926658_s7	Co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression had significantly poorer disease-free survival rates ( P â= 0.004 ) and overall survival rates ( P = 0.001 ) than other phenotypes .	
22926658_s8	CONCLUSIONS Co-existence of CCND1 and VEGF overexpression would potentially assist in TNM staging systems to predict the prognosis of these patients who would benefit from intensive follow-up and therapeutic programs .	
22927549_s0	Cancer immunoediting is the process whereby immune cells protect against cancer formation by sculpting the immunogenicity of developing tumors .	
22927549_s1	Although the full process depends on innate and adaptive immunity , it remains unclear whether innate immunity alone is capable of immunoediting .	
22927549_s2	To determine whether the innate immune system can edit tumor cells in the absence of adaptive immunity , we compared the incidence and immunogenicity of 3'methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas in syngeneic wild-type , RAG2(-/-) , and RAG2(-/-)x Î³c(-/-) mice .	
22927549_s3	We found that innate immune cells could manifest cancer immunoediting activity in the absence of adaptive immunity .	avoiding immune destruction
22927549_s4	This activity required natural killer ( NK ) cells and interferon Î³ ( IFN-Î³ ) , which mediated the induction of M1 macrophages .	
22927549_s5	M1 macrophages could be elicited by administration of CD40 agonists , thereby restoring editing activity in RAG2(-/-)x Î³c(-/-) mice .	
22927549_s6	Our results suggest that in the absence of adaptive immunity , NK cell production of IFN-Î³ induces M1 macrophages , which act as important effectors during cancer immunoediting .	avoiding immune destruction
22927647_s0	Cellular senescence has emerged as a critical tumor suppressive mechanism in recent years , but relatively little is known about how senescence occurs .	
22927647_s1	Here , we report that secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 ( SFRP1 ) , a secreted antagonist of Wnt signaling , is oversecreted upon cellular senescence caused by DNA damage or oxidative stress .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
22927647_s2	SFRP1 is necessary for stress-induced senescence caused by these factors and is sufficient for the induction of senescence phenotypes .	enabling replicative immortality
22927647_s3	We present evidence suggesting that SFRP1 functions as a secreted mediator of senescence through inhibition of Wnt signaling and activation of the retinoblastoma ( Rb ) pathway and that cancer-associated SFRP1 mutants are defective for senescence induction .	enabling replicative immortality
22934133_s0	We show that sufficient concentrations of gold nanoparticles produced by an original synthesis method in EMT-6 and CT-26 cancer cells make it possible to detect the presence , necrosis and proliferation of such cells after inoculation in live mice .	
22934133_s1	We first demonstrated that the nanoparticles do not interfere with the proliferation process .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22934133_s2	Then , we observed significant differences in the tumor evolution and the angiogenesis process after shallow and deep inoculation .	inducing angiogenesis
22934133_s3	A direct comparison with pathology optical images illustrates the effectiveness of this approach .	
22934253_s0	The development of targeted therapies and immunotherapies has markedly advanced the treatment of metastasized melanoma .	
22934253_s1	While treatment with selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitors ( like vemurafenib or dabrafenib ) leads to high response rates but short response duration , CTLA-4 blocking therapies induce sustained responses , but only in a limited number of patients .	
22934253_s2	The combination of these diametric treatment approaches may further improve survival , but pre-clinical data concerning this approach is limited .	
22934253_s3	We investigated , using Tyr::CreER(T2)PTEN(F-/-)BRAF(F-V600E/+) inducible melanoma mice , whether BRAF(V600E) inhibition can synergize with anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment , focusing on the interaction between the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720 and the immune system .	
22934253_s4	While PLX4720 treatment strongly decreased tumor growth , it did not induce cell death in BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(-/-) melanomas .	
22934253_s5	More strikingly , PLX4720 treatment led to a decreased frequency of tumor-resident T cells , NK-cells , MDSCs and macrophages , which could not be restored by the addition of anti-CTLA-4 mAb .	
22934253_s6	As this effect was not observed upon treatment of BRAF wild-type B16F10 tumors , we conclude that the decreased frequency of immune cells correlates to BRAF(V600E) inhibition in tumor cells and is not due to an off-target effect of PLX4720 on immune cells .	avoiding immune destruction
22934253_s7	Furthermore , anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment of inducible melanoma mice treated with PLX4720 did not result in enhanced tumor control , while anti-CTLA-4 mAb treatment did improve the effect of tumor-vaccination in B16F10-inoculated mice .	
22934253_s8	Our data suggest that vemurafenib may negatively affect the immune activity within the tumor .	avoiding immune destruction
22934253_s9	Therefore , the potential effect of targeted therapy on the tumor-microenvironment should be taken into consideration in the design of clinical trials combining targeted and immunotherapy .	
22934451_s0	BACKGROUND The presence of distant metastases from colorectal cancer ( CRC ) does not preclude curative treatment .	
22934451_s1	Early detection of pulmonary metastases at a potentially curable stage could improve survival .	
22934451_s2	The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic significance of commonly reported clinicopathologic features to identify high-risk patients who would likely benefit from more intensive chest surveillance for pulmonary metastases .	
22934451_s3	MATERIAL AND METHOD A total of 351 consecutive patients , with surgical stages I-III colorectal cancer , who underwent curative resection at Phramongkutklao hospital from 1999 to 2005 , were followed regularly according to the established guidelines with routine physical examination , serum carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) and colonoscopic surveillance .	
22934451_s4	Imaging studies for detecting metastases were computed tomography ( CT ) , plain film radiography , and ultrasonograpy .	
22934451_s5	Clinical and pathologic features were analyzed for their association with pulmonary metastasis .	
22934451_s6	RESULTS There were 145 patients who had been operated for longer than five years after curative intent surgery .	
22934451_s7	Of these , nineteen patients were lost to follow-up or died from other causes that were unrelated to colorectal cancer .	
22934451_s8	Pulmonary metastases were detected in 26 patients by either CXR or CT scan .	activating invasion and metastasis
22934451_s9	Median time to pulmonary metastasis was 19 months ( 95 percent CI , 12-35 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
22934451_s10	According to an univariate analysis , with log-rank test , identified four factors associated with pulmonary metastasis : Tumor stage T4 , Nodal stage N2 , elevation of serum CEA &gt ; 3.4 ng/ml and presence of lymphovascular invasion(LVI) .	activating invasion and metastasis
22934451_s11	According to a multivariate analysis , with Cox regression , found an elevation of serum CEA &gt ; 3.4 ng/ml which was an independent factor that was significantly associated with pulmonary metastasis ( Hazard ratio ( HR ) , 8.9 ; 95 percent CI , 3.6-22 ; p &lt ; 0.01 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
22934451_s12	The present study revealed that 50 percent of patients who had more than one of these risk factors would eventually develop pulmonary metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
22934451_s13	CONCLUSION An elevation of serum CEA &gt ; or = 3.4 ng/ml was found as an independent factor that was significantly associated with pulmonary metastasis whereas tumor stage T4 , nodal stage N2 and presence of lymphovascular invasion ( LVI ) were not independent clinicopathologic features associated with subsequent pulmonary metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
22934451_s14	Chest CT scan has greater sensitivity than chest radiography in detection of pulmonary metastasis and should be considered as an imaging study of choice for intensive chest surveillance for patients who had more than one of these risk factors .	activating invasion and metastasis
22934693_s0	Depression is the most common psychiatric syndrome in cancer patients and adversely affects anti-cancer immune system and life quality of patients .	
22934693_s1	Antidepressant desipramine ( DMI ) is clinically prescribed in the auxiliary treatment of cancer patients .	
22934693_s2	Increasing evidences suggest that DMI has a broad spectrum of target-off biological effects , such as anticancer properties .	
22934693_s3	Our previous study revealed that DMI at the clinical relevant concentrations could induce CHOP-dependent apoptotic death in C6 glioma cells .	
22934693_s4	In this study , we further explored the pro-autophagic effect of DMI in C6 glioma cells and its underlying mechanism .	
22934693_s5	Treatment with DMI could induce autophagic cell death characterized by the formation of autophagosome and the elevated level of autophagic protein Beclin-1 and cellular redistribution of marker LC3 .	resisting cell death
22934693_s6	Meanwhile , DMI inhibited the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway which is considered as a negative regulator of autophagy .	resisting cell death
22934693_s7	Furthermore , DMI activated PERK-eIF2Î± and ATF6 of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress pathway , while knockdown of PERK with the PERK-specific short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) could obviously attenuate the autophagy .	resisting cell death
22934693_s8	The results strongly suggested that DMI could induce autophagy through the PERK-ER stress pathway in C6 glioma cells .	resisting cell death
22934693_s9	Our findings provided new insights into another beneficial potential of antidepressant DMI in the adjuvant therapy of cancer .	
22937180_s0	Therapy-induced senescence ( TIS ) , a cytostatic stress response in cancer cells , is induced inefficiently by current anticancer agents and radiation .	
22937180_s1	The mechanisms that mediate TIS in cancer cells are not well defined .	
22937180_s2	Herein , we characterize a robust senescence response both in vitro and in vivo to the quinone diaziquone ( AZQ ) , previously identified in a high-throughput senescence-induction small-molecule screen .	
22937180_s3	Using AZQ and several other agents that induce senescence , we screened a series of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and found that p27(Kip1) was induced in all investigated prostate cancer cell lines .	
22937180_s4	The ubiquitin-ligase Skp2 negatively regulates p27(Kip1) and , during TIS , is translocated to the cytoplasm before its expression is decreased in senescent cells .	enabling replicative immortality
22937180_s5	Overexpression of Skp2 blocks the effects of AZQ on senescence and p27(Kip1) induction .	enabling replicative immortality
22937180_s6	We also find that stable long-term short hairpin RNA knockdown of Skp2 decreases proliferation but does not generate the complete senescence phenotype .	enabling replicative immortality
22937180_s7	We conclude that Skp2 participates in regulating TIS but , alone , is insufficient to induce senescence in cancer cells .	enabling replicative immortality
22941038_s0	Dendritic cells ( DCs ) and natural killer ( NK ) cells are central components of innate immunity for controlling tumor growth .	
22941038_s1	The therapeutic effects of certain anti-myeloma drugs are partially mediated by targeting the innate immune response .	
22941038_s2	In addition , novel types of natural compounds have been developed that efficiently modulate the activity of both the cellular and humoral compartments of immunity .	
22941038_s3	MGN-3 is known as an activator of natural killer cells , inducer of apoptosis and cytokine production , and modulator of dendritic cell maturation and differentiation in vitro .	
22941038_s4	We have performed a randomized , placebo-controlled study to examine the effects of MGN-3 on innate immune system parameters in 48 multiple myeloma patients .	
22941038_s5	We performed immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood samples , determined NK cell activity , and assessed the cytokine profiles of plasma before and during 3months of treatment .	
22941038_s6	The results demonstrate a clear increase in NK activity in MGN-3-treated patients compared to the placebo group , an increased level of myeloid DCs in peripheral blood , and augmented concentrations of T helper cell type 1-related cytokines .	
22941038_s7	The present study suggests that MGN-3 may represent an immunologically relevant product for activating innate immunity in multiple myeloma patients and warrants further testing to demonstrate clinical efficacy .	avoiding immune destruction
22941289_s0	AIM To elucidate the roles of receptor tyrosine kinases RET and VEGFR2 and the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade in cancer treatment with sorafenib .	
22941289_s1	METHODS The cell lines A549 , HeLa , and HepG2 were tested .	
22941289_s2	The enzyme activity was examined under cell-free conditions using 384-well microplate assays .	
22941289_s3	Cell proliferation was evaluated using the Invitrogen Alarmar Blue assay .	
22941289_s4	Gene expression was analyzed using the Invitrogen SYBR Green expression assays with a sequence detection system .	
22941289_s5	Protein expression analysis was performed using Western blotting .	
22941289_s6	RESULTS Sorafenib potently suppressed the activities of cRAF , VEGFR2 , and RET with IC(50) values of 20.9 , 4 and 0.4 nmol/L , respectively .	
22941289_s7	Sorafenib inhibited cRAF , VEGFR2 , and RET via non-ATP-competitive , ATP-competitive and mixed-type modes , respectively .	
22941289_s8	In contrast , sorafenib exerted only moderate cytotoxic effects on the proliferation of the 3 cell lines .	
22941289_s9	The IC(50) values for inhibition of A549 , HeLa , and HepG2 cells were 8572 , 4163 , and 8338 nmol/L , respectively .	
22941289_s10	In the 3 cell lines , sorafenib suppressed the cell proliferation mainly by blocking the MEK/ERK downstream pathway at the posttranscriptional level , which in turn regulated related gene expression via a feed-back mechanism .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22941289_s11	CONCLUSION This study provides novel evidence that protein kinases RET and VEGFR2 play crucial roles in cancer treatment with sorafenib .	
22941331_s0	The cadherins are a family of cell surface glycoproteins responsible for cell adhesion which play an important role in cell morphology , contact inhibition and signal transduction during tumorigenesis .	
22941331_s1	Protocadherin 8 ( PCDH8 ) , a member of the cadherin family , has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor involved in oncogenesis in breast cancer .	
22941331_s2	In this study , we aimed to investigate the epigenetic inactivation of PCDH8 and its tumor suppressor function in gastric cancer .	
22941331_s3	The expression of PCDH8 was markedly reduced or silenced in gastric cancer cell lines compared with normal gastric cells or tissues .	
22941331_s4	Methylation of the PCDH8 gene promoter was observed in 100% ( 4/4 ) of cell lines and 55.38% ( 36/65 ) of the primary gastric cancer by methylation-specific PCR , but not in normal gastric mucosa ( 0/10 ) .	
22941331_s5	Methylated PCDH8 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in a logistic regression analysis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22941331_s6	The demethylation reagent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine was able to restore or upregulate PCDH8 expression in gastric cancer cell lines .	
22941331_s7	Ectopic expression of PCDH8 in silenced gastric cancer cells significantly inhibited cell migration and induced apoptosis .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
22941331_s8	For the first time , our study demonstrates the epigenetic inactivation of PCDH8 by promoter methylation and its tumor suppressor function in human gastric cancer .	
22941331_s9	Thus , PCDH8 could be identified as a candidate tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer .	
22945332_s0	Therapy-induced cellular senescence ( TCS ) , characterized by prolonged cell cycle arrest , is an in vivo response of human cancers to chemotherapy and radiation .	
22945332_s1	Unfortunately , TCS is reversible for a subset of senescent cells , leading to cellular reproliferation and ultimately tumor progression .	
22945332_s2	This invariable consequence of TCS recapitulates the clinical treatment experience of patients with advanced cancer .	
22945332_s3	We report the findings of a clinicopathological study in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer demonstrating that marker of in vivo TCS following neoadjuvant therapy prognosticate adverse clinical outcome .	
22945332_s4	In our efforts to elucidate key molecular pathways underlying TCS and cell cycle escape , we have previously shown that the deregulation of mitotic kinase Cdk1 and its downstream effectors are important mediators of survival and cell cycle reentry .	
22945332_s5	We now report that aberrant expression of Cdk1 interferes with apoptosis and promotes the formation of polyploid senescent cells during TCS .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
22945332_s6	These polyploid senescent cells represent important transition states through which escape preferentially occurs .	enabling replicative immortality
22945332_s7	The Cdk1 pathway is in part modulated differentially by p21 and p27 two members of the KIP cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor family during TCS .	
22945332_s8	Altogether , these studies underscore the importance of TCS in cancer therapeutics .	
22948179_s0	The aberrant activation of sonic hedgehog ( SHH ) pathway contributes to initiation and progression of various malignancies .	
22948179_s1	However , the roles and underlying mechanisms of SHH signaling pathway in invasion and metastasis of liver cancer have not been well understood .	
22948179_s2	In this study , we found that SHH signaling was activated and correlated with invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) .	
22948179_s3	Enhanced SHH signaling by recombinant human SHH N-terminal peptide ( rSHH-N ) promoted hepatoma cell adhesion , migration and invasion , whereas blockade of SHH signaling with SHH neutralizing antibody or cyclopamine suppressed hepatoma cell adhesion , migration and invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
22948179_s4	Furthermore , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expressions and activities were upregulated and downregulated by rSHH-N and SHH signaling inhibitor , respectively .	
22948179_s5	The rSHH-N-mediated hepatoma cell migration and invasion was blocked by MMP-specific inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies to MMP-2 and MMP-9 .	activating invasion and metastasis
22948179_s6	In addition , phosphorylations of AKT and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) were increased and decreased by rSHH-N and SHH signaling inhibitor , respectively .	
22948179_s7	Further investigations showed that activation of AKT and FAK were required for rSHH-N-mediated upregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 , cell migration and invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
22948179_s8	Finally , we found that SHH protein expression was positively correlated with phosphorylatd FAK Tyr397 , phosphorylatd AKT Ser473 , MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expressions in HCC samples .	
22948179_s9	Taken together , our findings suggest that SHH pathway induces cell migration and invasion through FAK/AKT signaling-mediated MMP-2 and MMP-9 production and activation in liver cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis
22948721_s0	PURPOSE This study investigated the impact of specific mutations in codon 12 of the Kirsten-ras ( KRAS ) gene on treatment efficacy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) .	
22948721_s1	PATIENTS Overall , 119 patients bearing a KRAS mutation in codon 12 were evaluated .	
22948721_s2	All patients received cetuximab-based first-line chemotherapy within the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group ( CECOG ) , AIO KRK-0104 or AIO KRK-0306 trials .	
22948721_s3	RESULTS Patients with KRAS codon 12 mutant mCRC showed a broad range of outcome when treated with cetuximab-based first-line regimens .	genomic instability and mutation
22948721_s4	Patients with tumors bearing a KRAS p.G12D mutation showed a strong trend to a more favorable outcome compared to other mutations ( overall survival 23.3 vs. 14-18 months ; hazard ratio 0.66 , range 0.43-1.03 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
22948721_s5	An interaction model illustrated that KRAS p.G12C was associated with unfavorable outcome when treated with oxaliplatin plus cetuximab .	
22948721_s6	CONCLUSION The present analysis suggests that KRAS codon 12 mutation may not represent a homogeneous entity in mCRC when treated with cetuximab-based first-line therapy .	genomic instability and mutation
22949905_s0	Anal canal cancer is a rare tumor without clear treatment evidence in the metastatic setting .	
22949905_s1	In terms of the bad prognosis of patients with metastatic anal cancer , further therapeutic options are urgently needed .	
22949905_s2	In this paper we present the case of a 64-year-old man suffering from undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma with liver metastases .	
22949905_s3	After progression on cisplatin and fluorouracil , tumor tissue was analyzed with respect to anti-EGFR therapy with cetuximab .	
22949905_s4	There was no KRAS mutation and the EGFR expression level in the tumor tissue was 2+ ; ideal conditions for the immunotherapy .	genomic instability and mutation
22949905_s5	Encouraged by these results we started a therapy using FOLFIRI in combination with cetuximab .	
22949905_s6	Fortunately the patient showed a partial response after 6 cycles .	
22949905_s7	On patient's preference we did a therapy break of 6 weeks .	
22949905_s8	Within this time period the disease was progressive indicating its aggressiveness .	
22949905_s9	However , the same immunotherapy was able to stabilize the disease for a further 3 months .	
22949905_s10	The patient died 21 months after diagnosis because of liver failure .	
22949905_s11	Nevertheless , from our perspective the combination of FOLFIRI and cetuximab is quite a promising therapeutic option for patients with metastatic anal cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis
22949905_s12	Potential predictive factors of the immunochemotherapy are discussed in this paper .	
22951839_s0	We examined how well the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) E6 oncogene can function in the absence of the E7 oncogene during the carcinogenic process in human keratinocytes using a common HPV variant strongly associated with cervical cancer : the Asian-American E6 variant ( AAE6 ) .	
22951839_s1	This E6 variant is 20 times more frequently detected in cervical cancer than the prototype European E6 variant , as evidenced by independent epidemiological data .	
22951839_s2	Using cell culture and cell-based functional assays , we assessed how this variant can perform crucial carcinogenesis steps compared to the prototype E6 variant .	
22951839_s3	The ability to immortalize and transform primary human foreskin keratinocytes ( PHFKs ) to acquire resilient phenotypes and the ability to promote cell migration were evaluated .	
22951839_s4	The immortalization capability was assayed based on population doublings , number of passages , surpassing mortality stages 1 and 2 , human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( hTERT ) expression , and the ability to overcome G(1) arrest via p53 degradation .	
22951839_s5	Transformation and migration efficiency were analyzed using a combination of functional cell-based assays .	
22951839_s6	We observed that either AAE6 or prototype E6 proteins alone were sufficient to immortalize PHFKs , although AAE6 was more potent in doing so .	enabling replicative immortality
22951839_s7	The AAE6 variant protein alone pushed PHFKs through transformation and significantly increased their migration ability over that of the E6 prototype .	
22951839_s8	Our findings are in line with epidemiological data that the AA variant of HPV16 confers an increased risk over the European prototype for cervical cancer , as evidenced by a superior immortalization , transformation , and metastatic potential .	activating invasion and metastasis,enabling replicative immortality
22952573_s0	Biallelic mutations in MCPH1 cause primary microcephaly ( MCPH ) with the cellular phenotype of defective chromosome condensation .	
22952573_s1	MCPH1 encodes a multifunctional protein that notably is involved in brain development , regulation of chromosome condensation , and DNA damage response .	
22952573_s2	In the present studies , we detected that MCPH1 encodes several distinct transcripts , including two major forms : full-length MCPH1 ( MCPH1-FL ) and a second transcript lacking the six 3 ' exons ( MCPH1Δe9-14 ) .	
22952573_s3	Both variants show comparable tissue-specific expression patterns , demonstrate nuclear localization that is mediated independently via separate NLS motifs , and are more abundant in certain fetal than adult organs .	
22952573_s4	In addition , the expression of either isoform complements the chromosome condensation defect found in genetically MCPH1-deficient or MCPH1 siRNA-depleted cells , demonstrating a redundancy of both MCPH1 isoforms for the regulation of chromosome condensation .	
22952573_s5	Strikingly however , both transcripts are regulated antagonistically during cell-cycle progression and there are functional differences between the isoforms with regard to the DNA damage response ; MCPH1-FL localizes to phosphorylated H2AX repair foci following ionizing irradiation , while MCPH1Δe9-14 was evenly distributed in the nucleus .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
22952573_s6	In summary , our results demonstrate here that MCPH1 encodes different isoforms that are differentially regulated at the transcript level and have different functions at the protein level .	
22952881_s0	BACKGROUND Chemokines are involved in multiple aspects of pathogenesis and cellular trafficking in tumorigenesis .	
22952881_s1	In this study , we report that the latest member of the C-X-C-type chemokines , CXCL17 ( DMC/VCC-1 ) , recruits immature myeloid-derived cells and enhances early tumor progression .	
22952881_s2	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS CXCL17 was preferentially expressed in some aggressive types of gastrointestinal , breast , and lung cancer cells .	
22952881_s3	CXCL17 expression did not impart NIH3T3 cells with oncogenic potential in vitro , but CXCL17-expressing NIH3T3 cells could form vasculature-rich tumors in immunodeficient mice .	inducing angiogenesis
22952881_s4	Our data showed that CXCL17-expressing tumor cells increased immature CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid-derived cells at tumor sites in mice and promoted CD31(+) tumor angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
22952881_s5	Extensive chemotactic assays proved that CXCL17-responding cells were CD11b(+)Gr1(high)F4/80(-) cells ( â 90% ) with a neutrophil-like morphology in vitro .	
22952881_s6	Although CXCL17 expression could not increase the number of CD11b(+)Gr1(+) cells in tumor-burdened SCID mice or promote metastases of low metastatic colon cancer cells , the existence of CXCL17-responding myeloid-derived cells caused a striking enhancement of xenograft tumor formation .	activating invasion and metastasis
22952881_s7	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These results suggest that aberrant expression of CXCL17 in tumor cells recruits immature myeloid-derived cells and promotes tumor progression through angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
22953701_s0	UNLABELLED BACKGROUND We aimed to develop a mouse spontaneous liver metastasis model from an orthotopically implanted human colon cancer cell line stably expressing a human sodium/iodide symporter ( NIS ) reporter gene , which can be imaged with single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) using 99mTcO4- .	
22953701_s1	METHODS A recombinant plasmid containing a constitutively driven NIS gene ( pcDNA3-NIS ) was transfected into the human colon cancer cell line HCT116 , and stable cell lines were established .	
22953701_s2	The stable cells were subcutaneously injected into the nude mice .	
22953701_s3	When the diameter reached 10âmm , the xenografts were excised , cut into small fragments , and orthotopically implanted into the cecal walls of another nude mice. 99mTcO4- SPECT/CT imaging was initiated 8âweeks later and repeated every 1 to 2âweeks .	
22953701_s4	RESULTS The production and function of NIS protein was confirmed in vitro by Western blotting and 99mTcO4- uptake assay .	
22953701_s5	On SPECT/CT imaging , focal 99mTcO4- uptake was detected in the liver .	
22953701_s6	Necropsy revealed local growth of the orthotopic colon xenografts with extensive invasion , microscopic serosal metastasis , and metastatic foci in the corresponding hepatic regions showing focal 99mTcO4- uptake .	activating invasion and metastasis
22953701_s7	Immunohistochemistry revealed high levels of NIS expression in cells forming liver tumor , indicating that the liver tumor cells originated from the orthotopic colon xenografts .	
22953701_s8	CONCLUSIONS The present proof-of-concept study provided a rationale for employing a radionuclide reporter gene for the specific visualization of spontaneous liver metastasis in living mice .	activating invasion and metastasis
22953701_s9	This unique animal model of clinically relevant and externally detectable liver metastasis will be a powerful tool for investigating tumor biology and developing novel therapies for cancer metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22954700_s0	Cancer cells convert glucose preferentially to lactate even in the presence of oxygen ( aerobic glycolysis-Warburg effect ) .	
22954700_s1	New concepts in cancer treatment aim at inhibition of aerobic glycolysis .	
22954700_s2	Pyruvate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate to acetylCoA thus preventing lactate formation .	
22954700_s3	Therefore , the aim of this study was to evaluate compounds that could activate pyruvate dehydrogenase in cancer cells .	
22954700_s4	We investigated the effects of ( R)-(+)-Î±-lipoic acid ( LPA ) and dichloroacetate ( DCA ) , possible activators of pyruvate dehydrogenase , on suppression of aerobic glycolysis and induction of cell death .	
22954700_s5	The neuroblastoma cell lines Kelly , SK-N-SH , Neuro-2a and the breast cancer cell line SkBr3 were incubated with different concentrations ( 0.1-30 mM ) of LPA and DCA .	
22954700_s6	The effects of both compounds on cell viability/proliferation ( WST-1 assay ) , [ 18F]-FDG uptake , lactate production and induction of apoptosis ( flow cytometric detection of caspase-3 ) were evaluated .	
22954700_s7	Furthermore , NMRI nu/nu mice that had been inoculated s.c. with SkBr3 cells were treated daily for four weeks with LPA ( i.p , 18.5 mg/kg ) starting at day 7 p.i. .	
22954700_s8	Tumor development was measured with a sliding calliper and monitored via [ 18F]-FDG-PET .	
22954700_s9	Residual tumors after therapy were examined histopathologically .	
22954700_s10	These data suggests that LPA can reduce ( 1 ) cell viability/proliferation , ( 2 ) uptake of [ 18F]-FDG and ( 3 ) lactate production and increase apoptosis in all investigated cell lines .	cellular energetics,resisting cell death
22954700_s11	In contrast , DCA was almost ineffective .	
22954700_s12	In the mouse xenograft model with s.c .	
22954700_s13	SkBr3 cells , daily treatment with LPA retarded tumor progression .	
22954700_s14	Therefore , LPA seems to be a promising compound for cancer treatment .	
22956286_s0	The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a member of the HER family receptors and its activation induced by its natural ligand EGF results in colon cancer growth and progression .	
22956286_s1	Panitumumab ( pmAb ) is a fully human IgG2 anti-EGFR antibody that blocks the EGFR actions .	
22956286_s2	In the present study , we evaluated the effects of pmAb on the EGF-mediated cellular responses in a panel of colon cancer cells ( HCT-8 , HT-29 , DLD-1 and HCT-116 ) .	
22956286_s3	HCT-1116 and DLD-1 cells showed no significant EGF-dependent cell proliferation ; HT-29 and HCT-8 exhibited an EGF-dependent proliferation , with HCT-8 cells to be the most responsive with significant EGFR phosphorylation upon treatment with EGF .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22956286_s4	The effects of pmAb were then evaluated in the most EGF-responsive cells , HCT-8 .	
22956286_s5	In that respect , pmAb impedes the signaling cascade mediated by EGFR intracellular phosphorylation and activity of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) as well as the EGF-induced invasive and migratory potential of colon cancer cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22956286_s6	At the level of matrix effectors implicated in colon cancer progression we report that pmAb is a potent inhibitor of constitute and EGF-mediated gene expression of certain matrix effectors , such as membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase ( MT1-MMP ) , extracellular metalloproteinases inducer ( EMMPRIN ) , urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) and syndecan-4 .	
22956286_s7	The obtained data demonstrated that pmAb is a specific blocker of EGF-mediated EGFR activation , resulting in a significant inhibition of colon cancer cell proliferation in early stages of growth , migration and invasiveness as well as of matrix effector implicated in cancer progression .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22962263_s0	Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment plays a central role in the evolution of immune escape mechanisms by tumor cells .	
22962263_s1	In this study , we report the definition of miR-210 as a miRNA regulated by hypoxia in lung cancer and melanoma , documenting its involvement in blunting the susceptibility of tumor cells to lysis by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL). miR-210 was induced in hypoxic zones of human tumor tissues .	
22962263_s2	Its attenuation in hypoxic cells significantly restored susceptibility to autologous CTL-mediated lysis , independent of tumor cell recognition and CTL reactivity .	
22962263_s3	A comprehensive approach using transcriptome analysis , argonaute protein immunoprecipitation , and luciferase reporter assay revealed that the genes PTPN1 , HOXA1 , and TP53I11 were miR-210 target genes regulated in hypoxic cells .	
22962263_s4	In support of their primary importance in mediating the immunosuppressive effects of miR-210 , coordinate silencing of PTPN1 , HOXA1 , and TP53I11 dramatically decreased tumor cell susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis .	avoiding immune destruction
22962263_s5	Our findings show how miR-210 induction links hypoxia to immune escape from CTL-mediated lysis , by providing a mechanistic understanding of how this miRNA mediates immunosuppression in oxygen-deprived regions of tumors where cancer stem-like cells and metastatic cellular behaviors are known to evolve .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
22964484_s0	Senescence , an inherent tumor suppressive mechanism , is a critical determinant for chemotherapy .	
22964484_s1	In the present study , we show that the monocarboxylate transporter 2 ( MCT2 ) protein was tumor-selectively expressed in human colorectal malignancies and knockdown of MCT2 induces mitochondrial dysfunction , cell-cycle arrest , and senescence without additional cellular stress in colorectal cancer cell lines .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
22964484_s2	Moreover , the reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) scavenger , N-acetylcysteine , blocked MCT2 knockdown-induced growth arrest and cellular senescence , indicating a pivotal role of ROS in this pathway .	enabling replicative immortality,tumor promoting inflammation
22964484_s3	Dramatic induction of mitochondrial superoxide generation and decrease in ATP production was observed , indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction is the major mechanism underlying MCT2 knockdown-induced ROS generation .	tumor promoting inflammation
22964484_s4	Senescence-associated DNA damage was also evident from the increase in promyelocytic leukemia bodies , Î³H2AX foci , and SAHF .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
22964484_s5	Conversely , overexpression of MCT2 prevented doxorubicin-induced ROS accumulation ( P = 0.0002 ) and cell growth inhibition ( P = 0.001 ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
22964484_s6	MCT2 knockdown suppressed KRAS mutant colorectal tumor growth in vivo .	
22964484_s7	In addition , MCT2 knockdown and cytostatic drug combination further enhanced the antitumor effect .	
22964484_s8	These findings support the use of MCT2 as a promising target for inhibition of colorectal cancer .	
22968518_s0	OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in cervical squamous carcinoma .	
22968518_s1	METHODS Eighty cases of invasive cervical squamous cancer were selected as objects of our study .	
22968518_s2	Double immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 and Ki-67 was used to label the lymphatic vessels and mark the proliferative lymphatic vessels in cervical squamous cancer .	
22968518_s3	The peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and intratumoral lymphatic vessel density was assessed .	
22968518_s4	The lymphatic vessels proliferation index was evaluated by calculating Ki-67 proliferation index ( PI ) to reflect the lymphangiogenesis of cervical squamous cancer .	
22968518_s5	Then the correlation between lymphangiogenesis and clinicopathologic features of cervical squamous cancer was analyzed .	
22968518_s6	RESULTS The LVD of cervical cancer ( 15.23 ï¿½ 3.6 ) was clearly higher than that of the adjacent normal cervical subepithelial tissues ( 9.9 ï¿½ 2.5 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
22968518_s7	The peritumoral lymphatic vessel density of cervical cancer ( 18.75 ï¿½ 4.3 ) was significantly higher than the intratumoral lymphatic vessel density of cervical cancer ( 11.71 ï¿½ 4.9 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
22968518_s8	Lymphatic PI ( LPI ) of cervical cancer ( 0.258 ï¿½ 0.07 ) was higher than that of the adjacent normal cervical subepithelial tissues ( 0.068 ï¿½ 0.08 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
22968518_s9	The peritumoral lymphatic vessel PI of cervical cancer ( 0.324 ï¿½ 0.06 ) was notably higher than the intratumoral lymphatic vessel PI of cervical cancer ( 0.232 ï¿½ 0.06 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
22968518_s10	Peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and peritumoral lymphatic vessel were clearly associated with the lymph node metastasis ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.002 , respectively ) and lymphovascular space invasion ( P = 0.024 and P = 0.01 , respectively ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
22968518_s11	CONCLUSIONS The high density of peritumoral lymphatic vessels is a potential predictor of more aggressive phenotype of cervical squamous cancer .	
22970173_s0	Cellular senescence can be a functional barrier to carcinogenesis .	
22970173_s1	We hypothesized that inflammation modulates carcinogenesis through senescence and DNA damage response ( DDR ) .	
22970173_s2	We examined the association between senescence and DDR with macrophage levels in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .	
22970173_s3	In vitro experiments tested the ability of macrophages to induce senescence in primary cells .	enabling replicative immortality
22970173_s4	Inflammation modulating microRNAs were identified in senescence colon tissue for further investigation .	enabling replicative immortality
22970388_s0	Background .	
22970388_s1	An important goal of personalized cancer therapy is to tailor specific therapies to the mutational profile of individual patients .	
22970388_s2	However , whole genome sequencing studies have shown that the mutational profiles of cancers evolve over time and often differ between primary and metastatic sites .	
22970388_s3	Activating point mutations in the PIK3CA gene are common in primary breast cancer tumors , but their presence in breast cancer bone metastases has not been assessed previously .	
22970388_s4	Results .	
22970388_s5	Fourteen patients with breast cancer bone metastases were biopsied by three methods : CT-guided bone biopsies ; bone marrow trephine biopsies ; and bone marrow aspiration .	
22970388_s6	Samples that were positive for cancer cells were obtained from six patients .	
22970388_s7	Three of these patients had detectable PIK3CA mutations in bone marrow cancer cells .	genomic instability and mutation
22970388_s8	Primary tumor samples were available for four of the six patients assessed for PIK3CA status in their bone metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
22970388_s9	For each of these , the PIK3CA mutation status was the same in the primary and metastatic sites .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
22970388_s10	Conclusions .	
22970388_s11	PIK3CA mutations occur frequently in breast cancer bone metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
22970388_s12	The PIK3CA mutation status in bone metastases samples appears to reflect the PIK3CA mutation status in the primary tumour .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
22970388_s13	Breast cancer patients with bone metastases may be candidates for treatment with selective PIK3CA inhibitors .	activating invasion and metastasis
22971811_s0	Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is classically illustrated by a desynchronized cytokine system with rise in inflammatory cytokines .	
22971811_s1	There are recent reports which emphasized the potential role of angiogenesis in the development of MM. Role of cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX-2 ) is well documented in the pathogenesis of solid tumors , but little is known about its occurrence and function in hematologic neoplasms .	
22971811_s2	Involvement of neoangiogenesis is reported in the progression of MM , and angiopoietins probably contribute to this progression by enhancing neovascularization .	
22971811_s3	Circulatory and mRNA levels of angiogenic factors and cyclooxygenase were determined in 125 subjects ( 75 MM patients and 50 healthy controls ) by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative PCR .	
22971811_s4	We observed significant increase for angiogenic factors ( Ang-1 , Ang-2 , hepatocyte growth factor , and vascular endothelial growth factor ) and cyclooxygenase at circulatory level , as well as at mRNA level , as compared to healthy controls except insignificant increase for Ang-1 at circulatory level .	inducing angiogenesis,tumor promoting inflammation
22971811_s5	We have also observed the significant positive correlation of all angiogenic factors with cyclooxygenase .	inducing angiogenesis
22971811_s6	The strong association found between angiogenic factors and COX-2 in this study may lead to the development of combination therapeutic strategy to treat MM. Therefore , targeting COX-2 by using its effective inhibitors demonstrating antiangiogenic and antitumor effects could be used as a new therapeutic approach for treatment of MM .	
22973555_s0	MAP17 is a small 17 kDa non-glycosylated membrane protein previously identified as being overexpressed in carcinomas .	
22973555_s1	Breast tumor cells that overexpress MAP17 show an increased tumoral phenotype with enhanced proliferative capabilities both in the presence or the absence of contact inhibition , decreased apoptotic sensitivity , and increased migration .	
22973555_s2	MAP17-expressing clones also grow better in nude mice .	
22973555_s3	The increased malignant cell behavior induced by MAP17 is associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , and the treatment of MAP17-expressing cells with antioxidants results in a reduction in the tumorigenic properties of these cells .	tumor promoting inflammation
22973555_s4	The MAP17-dependent increase in ROS and tumorigenesis relies on its PDZ-binding domain because disruption of this sequence by point mutations abolishes the ability of MAP17 to enhance ROS production and tumorigenesis .	genomic instability and mutation
22973555_s5	MAP17 is overexpressed in a great variety of human carcinomas , including breast tumors .	
22973555_s6	Immunohistochemical analysis of MAP17 during cancer progression demonstrates that overexpression of the protein strongly correlates with tumoral progression .	
22973555_s7	Generalized MAP17 overexpression in human carcinomas indicates that MAP17 can be a good marker for tumorigenesis and , especially , for malignant progression .	
22974233_s0	BACKGROUND Coronins are a family of highly evolutionary conserved proteins reportedly involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics , although only coronin 3 has been shown to be related to cancer cell migration .	
22974233_s1	In glioblastoma cells , the knockdown of coronin 3 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion .	
22974233_s2	Coronin 3 is also associated with the aggression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma .	
22974233_s3	In this paper , we analyze the migration , invasion and metastasis abilities of gastric cancer cells after up- or down-regulation of coronin 3 , and explore the mechanism of coronin 3 in the process of gastric cancer metastasis .	
22974233_s4	RESULTS The expression of coronin 3 was higher in the highly metastatic sub-cell line MKN28-M , which we established in our laboratory .	
22974233_s5	We also demonstrated that the expression of coronin 3 was remarkably higher in lymph lode metastases than in primary gastric cancer tissues , and over-expression of coronin 3 was correlated with the increased clinical stage and lymph lode metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22974233_s6	Recombinant lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs were designed to down-regulate coronin 3 expression in gastric cancer cell lines .	
22974233_s7	Stable knockdown of coronin 3 by this lentiviral vector could efficiently inhibit the migration and invasion of MKN45 gastric cancer cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22974233_s8	In contrast , up-regulation of coronin 3 significantly enhanced migration and invasion of MKN28-NM cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22974233_s9	In addition , knockdown of coronin 3 significantly reduced liver metastasis in mice after tail vein injection of gastric cancer cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22974233_s10	The Human Tumor Metastasis PCR Array was used to screen the metastasis-associated genes identified by the down-regulation of coronin 3 , and the results suggested that , following the knockdown of coronin 3 , the tumor cell migration and invasion were inhibited by the reduced expression of MMP-9 and cathepsin K. CONCLUSION Coronin 3 is highly expressed in gastric cancer metastases and can promote the metastatic behaviors of gastric cancer cells , including their migration and invasion .	
22980794_s0	Immunosenescence , the progressive decline of adaptive immunity and chronic inflammation with ageing has been demonstrated to be the main factor responsible for infections , cancer and autoimmune conditions in the elderly .	
22980794_s1	Senescence-accelerated mouse ( SAM ) was used to study the protective effects of Pu-erh tea in the elderly .	
22980794_s2	The senile-prone sub-strain , SAM-P8 mice were administered individually with ripened or crude Pu-erh tea at 125 , 250 or 500mg/kg .	
22980794_s3	The results showed that Pu-erh tea significantly increased the fractions of naï¿½ve T lymphocytes , CD8(+)CD28(+) T lymphocytes and NK cells in the peripheral blood , but decreased the levels of IL-6 in aged mice .	avoiding immune destruction
22980794_s4	These data suggested that the Pu-erh tea reversed the immunosenescence by restoring the immune deficiency and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine .	
22980794_s5	Thus , long term drinking of Pu-erh tea may be beneficial for the aged population in terms of increasing the body's resistance to infection and cancer .	
22981203_s0	The aim of this work was to characterize the antitumoral activity of the plant compound 7-epi-nemorosone in prostate carcinoma cell lines .	
22981203_s1	Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second-leading cause of cancer death in men .	
22981203_s2	In spite of the current therapeutic options for this cancer entity , many patients die due to metastases in distant organs and acquired chemotherapy resistance .	
22981203_s3	Thus , approaches to provide improvements in outcome and quality of life for such patients are urgently needed .	
22981203_s4	Recently , the polyisoprenylated benzophenone 7-epi-nemorosone , originally collected by honeybees from Clusia rosea and Clusia grandiflora ( Clusiaceae ) , has been described to be a potent antitumoral agent .	
22981203_s5	Here , its activity in prostate carcinoma is reported. 7-epi-nemorosone was isolated from Caribbean propolis employing RP-HPLC techniques .	
22981203_s6	Its cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT proliferation assay in human androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells including an MDR1(+) sub-line .	
22981203_s7	No cross-resistance was detected .	
22981203_s8	FACS-based cell cycle analysis revealed a significant increase in the sub-G0/G1 , G1 , and depletion in the S phase populations .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22981203_s9	A concomitant down-regulation of cyclins D1/D3 and CDK 4/6 in LNCaP cells was detected by Western blot .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22981203_s10	Annexin-V-FITC labeling and caspase-3 cleavage assays showed that 7-epi-nemorosone induced apoptotic events .	resisting cell death
22981203_s11	Major signal transduction elements such as p38 MAPK and Akt/PKB as well as androgen receptor AR and PSA production were found to be down-regulated after exposure to the drug .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22981203_s12	ERK1/2 protein levels and phosphorylation status were down-regulated accompanied by up-regulation but inhibition of the activity of their immediate upstream kinases MEK1/2 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22981203_s13	Additionally , Akt/PKB enzymatic activity was effectively inhibited at a similar concentration as for MEK1/2 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22981203_s14	Here , we demonstrate for the first time that 7-epi-nemorosone exerts cytotoxicity in an androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma entity by targeting the MEK1/2 signal transducer .	
22981962_s0	It is well established that aberrant production of inflammatory mediators has been associated with most the toxic manifestations and the genesis of different chronic diseases including cancer .	
22981962_s1	The basic aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of soy isoflavones ( SIF ) on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced cutaneous inflammatory responses and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms .	
22981962_s2	We have studied the protective effects of SIF against TPA induced oxidative stress , pro-inflammatory cytokines level , activation of NF-ÎºB , expression of COX-2 and ki-67 in mouse skin .	
22981962_s3	Animals were divided into five groups I-V ( n=6 ) .	
22981962_s4	Groups II , III and IV received topical application of TPA at the dose of 10 nmol/0.2 ml of acetone/animal/day , for 2 days .	
22981962_s5	Animals of the groups III and IV were pre-treated with SIF 1.0 Î¼g ( D1 ) and 2.0 Î¼g ( D2 ) topically 30 min prior to each TPA administration , while groups I and V were given acetone ( 0.2 ml ) and SIF ( D2 ) , respectively .	
22981962_s6	We have found that SIF pretreatment significantly inhibited TPA induced oxidative stress , proinflammatory cytokines production and activation of NF-ÎºB .	tumor promoting inflammation
22981962_s7	SIF also inhibited the expression of COX-2 and ki-67 .	
22981962_s8	Histological findings further supported the protective effects of SIF against TPA-induced cutaneous damage .	
22981962_s9	Thus , our results suggest that inhibitory effect of SIF on TPA-induced cutaneous inflammation includes inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines , attenuation of oxidative stress , activation of NF-ÎºB and expression of COX-2 .	tumor promoting inflammation
22982677_s0	Contact inhibition is a crucial mechanism regulating proliferation in vitro and in vivo .	
22982677_s1	Although it is generally accepted that contact inhibition plays a pivotal role in maintaining tissue homeostasis , the molecular mechanisms of contact inhibition are still not fully understood .	
22982677_s2	FoxM1 is known as a proliferation-associated transcription factor and is upregulated in many cancer types .	
22982677_s3	Vice versa , anti-proliferative signals , such as TGF-β and differentiation signals decrease FoxM1 expression .	
22982677_s4	Here we investigated the role of FoxM1 in contact inhibition in fibroblasts .	
22982677_s5	We show that protein expression of FoxM1 is severely and rapidly downregulated upon contact inhibition , probably by inhibition of ERK activity , which then leads to decreased expression of cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 .	evading growth suppressors
22982677_s6	Vice versa , ectopic expression of FoxM1 prevents the decrease in cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 and causes a two-fold increase in saturation density indicating loss of contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
22982677_s7	Hence , we show that downregulation of FoxM1 is required for contact inhibition by regulating expression of cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 .	evading growth suppressors
22983392_s0	AIM To investigate whether luteolin , a highly prevalent flavonoid , reverses the effects of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in vitro and in vivo and to determine the mechanisms underlying this reversal .	
22983392_s1	METHODS Murine malignant melanoma B16F10 cells were exposed to 1% O(2) for 24 h .	
22983392_s2	Cellular mobility and adhesion were assessed using Boyden chamber transwell assay and cell adhesion assay , respectively .	
22983392_s3	EMT-related proteins , such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin , were examined using Western blotting .	
22983392_s4	Female C57BL/6 mice ( 6 to 8 weeks old ) were injected with B16F10 cells ( 1ï¿½10(6) cells in 0.2 mL per mouse ) via the lateral tail vein .	
22983392_s5	The mice were treated with luteolin ( 10 or 20 mg/kg , ip ) daily for 23 d .	
22983392_s6	On the 23rd day after tumor injection , the mice were sacrificed , and the lungs were collected , and metastatic foci in the lung surfaces were photographed .	
22983392_s7	Tissue sections were analyzed with immunohistochemistry and HE staining .	
22983392_s8	RESULTS Hypoxia changed the morphology of B16F10 cells in vitro from the cobblestone-like to mesenchymal-like strips , which was accompanied by increased cellular adhesion and invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
22983392_s9	Luteolin ( 5-50 Î¼mol/L ) suppressed the hypoxia-induced changes in the cells in a dose-dependent manner .	
22983392_s10	Hypoxia significantly decreased the expression of E-cadherin while increased the expression of N-cadherin in the cells ( indicating the occurrence of EMT-like transformation ) , which was reversed by luteolin ( 5 Î¼mol/L ) .	
22983392_s11	In B16F10 cells , luteolin up-regulated E-cadherin at least partly via inhibiting the Î²3 integrin/FAK signal pathway .	
22983392_s12	In experimental metastasis model mice , treatment with luteolin ( 10 or 20 mg/kg ) reduced metastatic colonization in the lungs by 50% .	activating invasion and metastasis
22983392_s13	Furthermore , the treatment increased the expression of E-cadherin while reduced the expression of vimentin and Î²3 integrin in the tumor tissues .	
22983392_s14	CONCLUSION Luteolin inhibits the hypoxia-induced EMT in malignant melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo via the regulation of Î²3 integrin , suggesting that luteolin may be applied as a potential anticancer chemopreventative and chemotherapeutic agent .	
22987071_s0	p21 is a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that plays a role in promoting G1 cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence .	
22987071_s1	Consistent with this role , p21 is a downstream target of several tumour suppressors and oncogenes , and it is downregulated in the majority of tumours , including breast cancer .	
22987071_s2	Here , we report that protein arginine methyltransferase 6 ( PRMT6 ) , a type I PRMT known to act as a transcriptional cofactor , directly represses the p21 promoter .	
22987071_s3	PRMT6 knock-down ( KD ) results in a p21 derepression in breast cancer cells , which is p53-independent , and leads to cell cycle arrest , cellular senescence and reduced growth in soft agar assays and in severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mice for all the cancer lines examined .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
22987071_s4	We finally show that bypassing the p21-mediated arrest rescues PRMT6 KD cells from senescence , and it restores their ability to grow on soft agar .	enabling replicative immortality
22987071_s5	We conclude that PRMT6 acts as an oncogene in breast cancer cells , promoting growth and preventing senescence , making it an attractive target for cancer therapy .	enabling replicative immortality
22988493_s0	The molecular mechanism mediating expression of senescent cell antigen-aggregated or cleaved band 3 and externalized phosphatidylserine ( PS ) on the surface of aged erythrocytes and their premature expression in certain anemias is not completely elucidated .	
22988493_s1	The erythrocytes with these surface modifications undergo macrophage-mediated phagocytosis .	
22988493_s2	In this study , the role of protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoforms in the expression of these surface modifications was investigated .	
22988493_s3	Inhibition of PKC Î± by 30âÎ¼M rottlerin ( R30 ) and 2.3ânM Gï¿½ 6976 caused expression of both the senescent cell marker-externalized PS measured by FACS analysis and aggregated band 3 detected by western blotting .	enabling replicative immortality
22988493_s4	In contrast to this observation , but in keeping with literature , PKC activation by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) also led to the expression of senescence markers .	enabling replicative immortality
22988493_s5	We explain this antithesis by demonstrating that PMA-treated cells show reduction in the activity of PKC Î± , thereby simulating inhibition .	
22988493_s6	The reduction in PKC Î± activity may be attributed to the known downregulation of PMA-activated PKC Î± , caused by its membrane translocation and proteolysis .	
22988493_s7	We demonstrate membrane translocation of PKC Î± in PMA-treated cells to substantiate this inference .	
22988493_s8	Thus loss of PKC Î± activity either by inhibition or downregulation can cause surface modifications which can trigger erythrophagocytosis .	
22990536_s0	Ovarian cancer-related angiogenesis is a complex process orchestrated by many positive and negative regulators .	
22990536_s1	Many growth factors are involved in the development of the tumor-associated vasculature , and from these , endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor ( EG-VEGF ) seems to play a crucial role .	
22990536_s2	EG-VEGF is the first organ-specific angiogenic factor and its effects are restricted to the endothelial cells of the endocrine glands .	
22990536_s3	Although EG-VEGF was detected in both normal and neoplastic ovaries , its clinical significance remains controversial .	
22990536_s4	In the present study , we analyzed 30 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer , and the immunohistochemical expression of EG-VEGF was compared with the conventional clinico-pathological parameters of prognosis .	
22990536_s5	Neoplastic cells of the ovarian carcinoma expressed EG-VEGF in 73.33% of the cases , as a cytoplasmic granular product of reaction .	inducing angiogenesis
22990536_s6	We found a strong correlation between the expression of EG-VEGF at protein level and tumor stage , grade , and microscopic type .	inducing angiogenesis
22990536_s7	The expression of EG-VEGF was found in patients with stage III and IV , but not in stage II .	inducing angiogenesis
22990536_s8	The majority of serous adenocarcinoma , half of the cases with clear cell carcinoma and two cases with endometrioid carcinoma showed definite expression in tumor cells .	
22990536_s9	No positive reaction was found in the cases with mucinous carcinoma .	
22990536_s10	Our results showed that EG-VEGF expression is an indicator not only of the advanced stage , but also of ovarian cancer progression .	inducing angiogenesis
22990536_s11	Based on these data , we concluded that EG-VEGF expression in tumor cells of the epithelial ovarian cancer is a good marker of unfavorable prognosis and could be an attractive therapeutic target in patients with advanced-stage tumors , refractory conventional chemotherapy .	inducing angiogenesis
22991213_s0	UNLABELLED Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is a major liver malignancy .	
22991213_s1	We previously demonstrated that deregulation of epigenetic regulators is a common event in human HCC .	
22991213_s2	Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 ( SUV39H1 ) , the prototype of histone methyltransferase , is the major enzyme responsible for histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation , which , essentially , is involved in heterochromatin formation , chromosome segregation , and mitotic progression .	
22991213_s3	However , the implication of SUV39H1 in hepatocarcinogenesis remains elusive .	
22991213_s4	In this study , we found that SUV39H1 was frequently up-regulated in human HCCs and was significantly associated with increased Ki67 expression ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) and the presence of venous invasion ( P = 0.017 ) .	
22991213_s5	To investigate the role of SUV39H1 in HCC development , both gain- and loss-of-function models were established .	
22991213_s6	SUV39H1 overexpression remarkably enhanced HCC cell clonogenicity , whereas knockdown of SUV39H1 substantially suppressed HCC cell proliferation and induced cell senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
22991213_s7	In addition , ectopic expression of SUV39H1 increased the migratory ability of HCC cells , whereas a reduced migration rate was observed in SUV39H1 knockdown cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22991213_s8	The significance of SUV39H1 in HCC was further demonstrated in a nude mice model ; SUV39H1 knockdown drastically inhibited in vivo tumorigenicity and abolished pulmonary metastasis of HCC cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
22991213_s9	We also identified microRNA-125b ( miR-125b ) as a post-transcriptional regulator of SUV39H1 .	
22991213_s10	Ectopic expression of miR-125b inhibited SUV39H1 3'-untranslated-region-coupled luciferase activity and suppressed endogenous SUV39H1 expression at both messenger RNA and protein levels .	
22991213_s11	We have previously reported frequent down-regulation of miR-125b in HCC .	
22991213_s12	Interestingly , miR-125b level was found to be inversely correlated with SUV39H1 expression ( P = 0.001 ) in clinical specimens .	
22991213_s13	Our observations suggested that miR-125b down-regulation may account for the aberrant SUV39H1 level in HCC .	
22991213_s14	CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that SUV39H1 up-regulation contributed to HCC development and metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
22991213_s15	The tumor-suppressive miR-125b served as a negative regulator of SUV39H1 .	
22992618_s0	Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for the development of colon cancer , providing genotoxic insults , growth and pro-angiogenic factors that can promote tumorigenesis and tumor growth .	
22992618_s1	Immunomodulatory agents can interfere with the inflammation that feeds cancer , but their impact on the transformed cell is poorly understood .	
22992618_s2	The calcium/calcineurin signaling pathway , through activation of NFAT , is essential for effective immune responses , and its inhibitors cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 are used in the clinics to suppress immunity .	
22992618_s3	Moreover , the kinases GSK3Î² and mTOR , modulated by PI-3K/Akt , can inhibit NFAT activity , suggesting a cross-talk between the calcium and growth factor signaling pathways .	
22992618_s4	Both NFAT and mTOR activity have been associated with tumorigenesis .	
22992618_s5	We therefore investigated the impact of calcineurin and PI-3K/mTOR inhibition in growth of human colon carcinoma cells .	
22992618_s6	We show that despite the efficient inhibition of NFAT1 activity , FK506 promotes tumor growth , whereas CsA inhibits it due to a delay in cell cycle progression and induction of necroptosis .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22992618_s7	We found NFÎºB activation and mTORC1 activity not to be altered by CsA or FK506 .	
22992618_s8	Similarly , changes to mitochondrial homeostasis were equivalent upon treatment with these drugs .	
22992618_s9	We further show that , in our model , NFAT1 activation is not modulated by PI3K/mTOR .	
22992618_s10	We conclude that CsA slows cell cycle progression and induces necroptosis of human carcinoma cell lines in a TGFÎ²- , NFAT- , NFÎºB- and PI3K/mTOR-independent fashion .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22992618_s11	Nevertheless , our data suggest that CsA , in addition to its anti-inflammatory capacity , may target transformed colon and esophagus carcinoma cells without affecting non-transformed cells , promoting beneficial tumoristatic effects .	tumor promoting inflammation
22992812_s0	Proline- , glutamic acid- and leucine-rich protein-1/modulator of non-genomic activity of estrogen receptor ( ER ) ( PELP1/MNAR ) is a novel nuclear receptor ( NR ) co-activator that plays an essential role in the actions of ER .	
22992812_s1	Emerging findings suggest that PELP1/MNAR is a novel proto-oncogene , whose expression is deregulated in several hormone-responsive cancers , including endometrial cancer .	
22992812_s2	In this study , we demonstrate that PELP1/MNAR is widely expressed in endometrial carcinoma cell lines .	
22992812_s3	To investigate its possible role in endometrial carcinoma progression , we adopted an RNA interference technology to downregulate PELP1/MNAR expression in Ishikawa endometrial carcinoma cells .	
22992812_s4	PELP1/MNAR downregulation substantially reduced cell proliferation , and the cells in which PELP1/MNAR expression was knocked down also exhibited a decreased migration and invasion ability , as shown by Boyden chamber and invasion assays .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22992812_s5	The results showed that the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was also decreased .	
22992812_s6	These results suggest that PELP1/MNAR plays a role in endometrial cancer progression and metastasis , and that PELP1/MNAR may be a potential therapeutic target for endometrial cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis
22997883_s0	OBJECTIVE To construct the eukaryotic expression vector for Max interacting protein 1 ( Mxi1 ) .	
22997883_s1	METHODS The full length cDNA of Mxi1 gene obtained from fetal lymphocyte and KG1 cells were inserted into plasmid pDs-red2-N1 respectively to generate pDs-red2-N1/Mri1 ( wild/mutation type ) .	
22997883_s2	Then the recombinant vector was transfected into Cos-7 cells via liposome. 48 hours post transfection , mRNA of Mri1 gene was detected by RT-PCR and Mxi1 protein expression was detected by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscope in the Cos-7 cells .	
22997883_s3	RESULTS The eukaryotic expression vector of Mxi1 was constructed and transfected into eukaryotic cells successfully .	
22997883_s4	The expression of red fluorescence protein in the transfected Cos-7 cells was observed under fluorescence microscope which implied the expression of Mxi1 .	
22997883_s5	The transfect efficiency of both wild and mutation type were in a high level in 3 days after transfected , which lasted to 6 d .	genomic instability and mutation
22997883_s6	RT-PCR amplified the total RNA extracted from the transfected Cos-7 cells could find increased mRNA level of Mxi1 gene .	genomic instability and mutation
22997883_s7	CONCLUSION We successfully constructed the eukaryote expression vector for Mri1 gene ; Cos-7 cells transfected with the vector via liposome could express Mxi1 protein .	
22997883_s8	These could be useful for the further study of the Myc gene modulation .	
23002206_s0	TGF-Î² derived from bone fuels melanoma bone metastases by inducing tumor secretion of prometastatic factors that act on bone cells to change the skeletal microenvironment .	
23002206_s1	Halofuginone is a plant alkaloid derivative that blocks TGF-Î² signaling with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties .	
23002206_s2	Here , we show for the first time that halofuginone therapy decreases development and progression of bone metastasis caused by melanoma cells through the inhibition of TGF-Î² signaling .	activating invasion and metastasis
23002206_s3	Halofuginone treatment of human melanoma cells inhibited cell proliferation , phosphorylation of SMAD proteins in response to TGF-Î² , and TGF-Î²-induced SMAD-driven transcription .	
23002206_s4	In addition , halofuginone reduced expression of TGF-Î² target genes that enhance bone metastases , including PTHrP , CTGF , CXCR4 , and IL11 .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23002206_s5	Also , cell apoptosis was increased in response to halofuginone .	resisting cell death
23002206_s6	In nude mice inoculated with 1205Lu melanoma cells , a preventive protocol with halofuginone inhibited bone metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
23002206_s7	The beneficial effects of halofuginone treatment were comparable with those observed with other anti-TGF-Î² strategies , including systemic administration of SD208 , a small-molecule inhibitor of TGF-Î² receptor I kinase , or forced overexpression of Smad7 , a negative regulator of TGF-Î² signaling .	
23002206_s8	Furthermore , mice with established bone metastases treated with halofuginone had significantly less osteolysis than mice receiving placebo assessed by radiography .	activating invasion and metastasis
23002206_s9	Thus , halofuginone is also effective in reducing the progression of melanoma bone metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
23002206_s10	Moreover , halofuginone treatment reduced melanoma metastasis to the brain , showing the potential of this novel treatment against cancer metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis

23002344_s0	AIM To assess the prognostic significance of nuclear factor-ÎºB ( NF-ÎºB ) and its target genes in gastric cancer .	
23002344_s1	METHODS The tumor tissues of 115 patients with gastric cancer were immunohistochemically evaluated using monoclonal antibodies against NF-ÎºB RelA .	
23002344_s2	Preoperative serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) were assessed via enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay .	
23002344_s3	C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and serum amyloid A ( SAA ) were measured via immunotrubidimetry .	
23002344_s4	RESULTS Positive rate of NF-ÎºB RelA was 42.6% .	
23002344_s5	NF-ÎºB RelA expression in tumor tissues was also related to serum levels of IL-6 ( P = 0.044 ) and CRP ( P = 0.010 ) .	
23002344_s6	IL-6 , SAA , CRP were related to depth of invasion , VEGF and SAA were correlated with lymph node metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
23002344_s7	IL-6 , VEGF , SAA and CRP were related to the stage .	
23002344_s8	Univariate analysis demonstrated that immunostaining of NF-ÎºB RelA , levels of IL-6 , VEGF , SAA were significantly related with both disease free survival and overall survival ( OS ) .	
23002344_s9	Multivariate analysis verified that NF-ÎºB RelA [ hazard ratio ( HR ) : 3.40 , P = 0.024 ] and SAA ( HR : 3.39 , P = 0.045 ) were independently associated with OS .	
23002344_s10	CONCLUSION Increased expression of NF-ÎºB RelA and high levels of serum SAA were associated with poor OS in gastric cancer patients .	
23006539_s0	The suppression of MAPK and oxidative stress could be an important anti-inflammatory mechanism .	
23006539_s1	Fucoidan regulates MAPK activity in several cell lines .	
23006539_s2	However , the mechanism for the anti-inflammatory and oxidative stress effect of low molecular weight fucoidan ( LMWF ) is poorly understood in RAW264.7 cells .	
23006539_s3	The objective of this study was to examine the critical role of LMWF during LPS-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells .	
23006539_s4	To determine the potential role of LMWF , we analysed pro-inflammatory cytokine , transcription factor , inflammation-related and oxidative stress related protein expression in vitro during LPS-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells .	
23006539_s5	In this study , we demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of LMWF on LPS-induced inflammation in macrophages through the regulation of signalling pathways , including its effect on the attenuation of inflammatory cytokines , such as IL-1Î² , IL-1 and TNF-Î± , and the degradation of phosphorylated p38 MAPK , ERK1/2 and JNK .	tumor promoting inflammation
23006539_s6	This study also demonstrates that LMWF might block NO as well as the expression of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which subsequently inhibits the iNOS and COX-2 expression induced by LPS .	tumor promoting inflammation
23006539_s7	Based on these findings , we suggest that LMWF might have great potential as an external pathogen prevention and intervention agent for inflammatory diseases .	tumor promoting inflammation
23008335_s0	Nutrient deprivation based on the loss of essential amino acids by catabolic enzymes in the microenvironment is a critical means to control inflammatory responses and immune tolerance .	
23008335_s1	Here we report the novel finding that Tph-1 ( tryptophan hydroxylase-1 ) , a synthase which catalyses the conversion of tryptophan to serotonin and exhausts tryptophan , is a potent regulator of immunity .	
23008335_s2	In models of skin allograft tolerance , tumor growth , and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , Tph-1 deficiency breaks allograft tolerance , induces tumor remission , and intensifies neuroinflammation , respectively .	
23008335_s3	All of these effects of Tph-1 deficiency are independent of its downstream product serotonin .	
23008335_s4	Because mast cells ( MCs ) appear to be the major source of Tph-1 and restoration of Tph-1 in the MC compartment in vivo compensates for the defect , these experiments introduce a fundamentally new mechanism of MC-mediated immune suppression that broadly impacts multiple arms of immunity .	avoiding immune destruction
23013101_s0	This study is to investigate the effects of bortezomib on the angiogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) .	
23013101_s1	We examined the effects of bortezomib on the cellular proliferation , migration , and capillary network formation of HUVECs cocultured with CMs of MSCs .	
23013101_s2	We found that Bortezomib inhibited the cellular proliferation and tube formation of HUVECs cocultured with CMs in a dose-dependent fashion .	
23013101_s3	Bortezomib also prevented the migration of HUVECs cocultured with CMs .	
23013101_s4	In addition , bortezomib dose-dependently inhibited the growth of MSCs and prevented the production of angiogenic factors including VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) , HGF ( hepatocyte growth factor ) , and bFGF ( basic fibroblast growth factor ) in MSCs .	inducing angiogenesis
23013101_s5	In conclusion , bortezomib prevented the angiogenesis mediated by MSCs .	inducing angiogenesis
23022267_s0	Retinoic acid ( RA)-induced differentiation therapy is partially successful in neuroblastoma treatment .	
23022267_s1	We found that a novel combination of vanadium-based PTP inhibitors with RA induced extensive differentiation in neuroblastoma cells .	
23022267_s2	In contrast to RA alone , this led to either permanent differentiation or senescence after 14days of combined treatment followed by chemical removal .	enabling replicative immortality
23022267_s3	Senescence was dependent in part on synergistic AKT and ERK activation. p21 was also strongly induced , but in contrast to oncogene-induced senescence , p53 was not activated .	enabling replicative immortality
23022267_s4	Vanadium-based inhibitors thus serve strongly to enhance RA's ability to drive differentiation and a novel form of senescence in neuroblastoma cells .	enabling replicative immortality
23023398_s0	Chronic inflammation is a critical component in breast cancer progression .	
23023398_s1	Pro-inflammatory mediators along with growth/survival factors within the tumor microenvironment potentiate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-Î± ) , chemotactic cytokines and their receptors ( CXCR4 , CXCL12 , CXCL8 ) and angiogenic factors ( VEGF ) that often overcome the effect of anti-inflammatory molecules ( IL-4 , IL-10 ) thus evading the host's antitumor immunity .	
23023398_s2	Detailed knowledge , therefore , of the regulatory mechanisms determining cytokine levels is essential to understand the pathogenesis of breast cancer .	
23023398_s3	HIF-1Î± and NF-ÎºB transcription factors are important players for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory and potentially oncogenic environment .	
23023398_s4	HIF-1Î± is the key mediator of the cellular response to oxygen deprivation and induces the expression of genes involved in survival and angiogenesis within solid hypoxic tumors .	
23023398_s5	The expression of these genes is often modulated by the p53 tumor suppressor protein that induces apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in neoplastic cells .	
23023398_s6	Functional crosstalk between HIF-1Î± and p53 pathways mediated by modulators shared between the two transcription factors such as SRC-1 and SIRT-1 differentially regulate the expression of distinct subsets of their target genes under variable stress conditions .	
23023398_s7	In an attempt to shed light on the complex regulatory mechanisms involved in cancer-related inflammation , we investigated the role of the two common p53 and HIF-1Î± co-regulators SRC-1 and SIRT-1 , in the expression of the highly potent metastatic chemokine receptor CXCR4 .	
23023398_s8	Both SRC-1 and SIRT-1 overexpression in DSFX-treated MCF-7 cells reduced CXCR4 cellular levels implying that both co-regulators are crucial factors in the determination of the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23023480_s0	Given the important role of CXCR4 in cancer metastasis , microenvironmental factors that modulate CXCR4 may have an impact on the process of tumor expansion .	
23023480_s1	Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and a significant microenvironmental factor that drives aggressive behavior .	
23023480_s2	CXCR4 is upregulated in several cancer cells under hypoxic conditions , suggesting a relationship between tumor hypoxia and CXCR4 .	
23023480_s3	However , the role of hypoxia in regulating CXCR4 in gastric cancer remains poorly understood .	
23023480_s4	KATO III gastric cancer cells were exposed to hypoxia or normoxia .	
23023480_s5	CXCR4 expression in cells transfected with shRNA specific for HIF-1Î± was investigated by western blotting and flow cytometry .	
23023480_s6	Wound healing , migration and invasion assays were used to assess cell motility and the chemotactic response to CXCL12 , a major CXCR4 ligand .	
23023480_s7	CXCR4 expression at the protein level and in the cell membrane was significantly increased in KATOIII cells following exposure to hypoxia .	
23023480_s8	This upregulation of CXCR4 was implicated in increased cell motility and enhanced chemotactic responses ( migration and invasion ) to CXCL12 treatment in vitro .	activating invasion and metastasis
23023480_s9	The increases in CXCR4 expression and metastatic potential in gastric cancer cells exposed to hypoxia were blocked by HIF-1Î±-specific shRNA .	activating invasion and metastasis
23023480_s10	Our results indicate that hypoxia upregulates CXCR4 in gastric cancer cells in a HIF-1Î±-dependent manner , and that upregulation of CXCR4 plays a role in cancer cell migration and invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
23023480_s11	Thus , disrupting the hypoxia-HIF-1Î±-CXCR4 axis could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer .	
23023561_s0	Advanced or metastatic prostate cancer is treated by androgen deprivation ; however , patients inevitably relapse with castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) .	
23023561_s1	CRPC remains dependent on androgen receptor ( AR ) signaling , which may include constitutive , ligand-independent action of naturally occurring AR splice variants .	
23023561_s2	For example , the AR splice variant AR3 ( also termed AR-V7 ) is expressed in CRPC and is linked to poor prognosis .	
23023561_s3	Vav3 , a Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor , is an AR coactivator that is up-regulated in human prostate cancer compared with benign tissue and in preclinical models of CRPC .	
23023561_s4	Vav3 confers castration-resistant growth to androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cells .	
23023561_s5	Despite the importance of AR coactivators in promoting CRPC , the potential role of these regulatory proteins in modulating AR splice variant activity is unknown .	
23023561_s6	We examined the contributions of Vav3 to AR activity in two CRPC cell lines that naturally express relatively high levels of Vav3 and AR3 .	
23023561_s7	Vav3 or AR3 knockdown greatly attenuated cell proliferation , soft agar growth , and ligand-independent AR activity .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23023561_s8	Vav3 potently enhanced the transcriptional activity of AR3 and another clinically relevant AR splice variant , ARv567es .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23023561_s9	Vav3 knockdown resulted in lowered nuclear AR3 levels , whereas total AR3 levels remained similar .	
23023561_s10	Conversely , overexpression of Vav3 resulted in increased nuclear AR3 .	
23023561_s11	Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that AR3 and Vav3 interact .	
23023561_s12	These novel data demonstrating physical and functional interactions between Vav3 , a unique AR coactivator , and an AR splice variant provide insights into the mechanisms by which Vav3 exploits and enhances AR signaling in the progression to CRPC .	
23026853_s0	Tumor cells trigger angiogenesis through overexpression of various angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and angiopoietin 1 ( Ang1 ) .	
23026853_s1	Therefore , inhibition of the expression of both VEGF and Ang1 , the initial step of tumor angiogenesis , is a promising strategy for cancer chemoprevention and therapy .	
23026853_s2	Grape seed proanthocyanidins ( GSPs ) are widely consumed dietary supplements that have antitumor activity .	
23026853_s3	Due to their polymeric structure , GSPs are poorly absorbed along the gastrointestinal tract and can reach the colon at high concentrations , allowing these chemicals to act as chemopreventive agents for colon cancer .	
23026853_s4	In the present study , we found that GSPs inhibited colon tumor-induced angiogenesis and , thus , the growth of colon tumor xenografts on the chick chorioallantoic membranes .	inducing angiogenesis
23026853_s5	The mechanisms of their action were related to inhibiting the expression of both VEGF and Ang1 through scavenging reactive oxygen species .	inducing angiogenesis,tumor promoting inflammation
23026853_s6	Previous studies have demonstrated that the chemopreventive effects of GSPs on colon cancer are associated with their growth inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects .	resisting cell death
23026853_s7	Our results demonstrate another mechanism by which GSPs inhibit colon tumor growth , which will be helpful for developing GSPs as a pharmacologically safe angiopreventive agent against colorectal cancer .	
23027128_s0	Protein tyrosine kinase 6 ( PTK6 ) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in epithelial cancers .	
23027128_s1	Disruption of Ptk6 decreases azoxymethane-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice by preventing signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation .	
23027128_s2	Relocalization of PTK6 in prostate cancers contributes to increased growth .	
23027128_s3	Although not expressed in normal breast or ovary , PTK6 promotes anchorage-independent survival of breast and ovarian tumor cells .	
23027128_s4	We identified several potential PTK6 substrates in the human SW620 colon cancer cell line using mass spectrometry , including FAK ( focal adhesion kinase ) .	
23027128_s5	We show that FAK is a direct substrate of PTK6 in vitro and in vivo .	
23027128_s6	Expression of membrane-targeted active PTK6 ( Palm-PTK6-YF ) induces constitutive activation of FAK and cell morphology changes , which are independent of SRC family kinases in Src-/- , Yes-/- , Fyn-/- ( SYF ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) .	
23027128_s7	Palm-PTK6-YF expressing SYF cells are transformed and overcome contact inhibition , form colonies in transformation assays , proliferate in suspension and form tumors in a xenograft model .	evading growth suppressors
23027128_s8	Expression of FAK and Palm-PTK6-YF in Fak-/- MEFs synergistically activates AKT and protects cells against anoikis .	
23027128_s9	However , expression of Palm-PTK6-YF in Akt1/2-/- MEFs fails to protect cells from anoikis , indicating AKT is critical in PTK6 and FAK-mediated survival signaling .	
23027128_s10	In a conditional Pten knockout murine prostate cancer model , we identify prostate epithelial cells with enhanced activation of endogenous PTK6 and FAK at the plasma membrane .	
23027128_s11	Knockdown of PTK6 in the PC3 human prostate cancer cell line disrupts FAK and AKT activation and promotes anoikis , which can be rescued by exogenous expression of FAK .	
23027128_s12	Our data reveal important roles for a PTK6-FAK-AKT signaling axis in promoting anchorage-independent cell survival .	
23028344_s0	Metastasis is a complex process utilizing both tumor-cell-autonomous properties and host-derived factors , including cellular immunity .	
23028344_s1	We have previously shown that germline polymorphisms can modify tumor cell metastatic capabilities through cell-autonomous mechanisms .	
23028344_s2	However , how metastasis susceptibility genes interact with the tumor stroma is incompletely understood .	
23028344_s3	Here , we employ a complex genetic screen to identify Cadm1 as a novel modifier of metastasis .	
23028344_s4	We demonstrate that Cadm1 can specifically suppress metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth .	activating invasion and metastasis
23028344_s5	Unexpectedly , Cadm1 did not alter tumor-cell-autonomous properties such as proliferation or invasion , but required the host's adaptive immune system to affect metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
23028344_s6	The metastasis-suppressing effect of Cadm1 was lost in mice lacking T cell-mediated immunity , which was partially phenocopied by depleting CD8(+) T cells in immune-competent mice .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
23028344_s7	Our data show a novel function for Cadm1 in suppressing metastasis by sensitizing tumor cells to immune surveillance mechanisms , and this is the first report of a heritable metastasis susceptibility gene engaging tumor non-autonomous factors .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
23028579_s0	It is known that sperm samples from recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL ) couples have an increase in their sperm DNA fragmentation ( SDF ) , but no studies have been performed in order to identify differences between single stranded SDF ( ssSDF ) and double stranded SDF ( dsSDF ) in these patients .	
23028579_s1	This could be relevant because the type of DNA damage could have different effects .	
23028579_s2	Semen samples were classified attending their clinical status : 25 fertile donors and 20 RPL patients with at least two unexplained first trimester miscarriages .	
23028579_s3	SDF was analysed using alkaline and neutral Comet assay , SCD test and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) , and ROC analysis including data from 105 more infertile patients ( n = 150 ) was performed to establish predictive threshold values .	
23028579_s4	SDF for alkaline and neutral Comet , and the SCD test was analysed in these categories of individuals .	
23028579_s5	Data revealed the presence of two subgroups within fertile donors .	
23028579_s6	The values obtained were 21.10±9.13 , 23.35±10.45 and 12.31±4.31 , respectively , for fertile donors with low values for both ssSDF and dsSDF ; 27.86±12.64 , 80.69±12.67 and 12.43±5.22 , for fertile donors with low ssSDF and high dsSDF ; and 33.61±15.50 , 84.64±11.28 and 19.28±6.05 , for unexplained RPL patients , also showing a low ssSDF and high dsSDF profile .	
23028579_s7	This latter profile was seen in 85% of unexplained RPL and 33% of fertile donors , suggesting that it may be associated to a male risk factor for undergoing RPL .	
23028579_s8	ROC analysis regarding recurrent miscarriage set the cut-off value at 77.50% of dsDNA SDF .	
23028579_s9	PFGE for low ssSDF and high dsSDF profile samples and positive controls treated with DNase , to induce dsDNA breaks , showed a more intense band of about 48 kb , which fits the toroid model of DNA compaction in sperm , pointing out that some nuclease activity may be affecting their sperm DNA in RPL patients .	genomic instability and mutation
23028579_s10	This work identifies a very specific SDF profile related to the paternal risk of having RPL .	
23028886_s0	Perlecan Domain V ( DV ) promotes brain angiogenesis by inducing VEGF release from brain endothelial cells ( BECs ) following stroke .	
23028886_s1	In this study , we define the specific mechanism of DV interaction with the Î±(5)Î²(1) integrin , identify the downstream signal transduction pathway , and further investigate the functional significance of resultant VEGF release .	
23028886_s2	Interestingly , we found that the LG3 portion of DV , which has been suggested to possess most of DV's angio-modulatory activity outside of the brain , binds poorly to Î±(5)Î²(1) and induces less BEC proliferation compared to full length DV .	
23028886_s3	Additionally , we implicate DV's DGR sequence as an important element for the interaction of DV with Î±(5)Î²(1) .	
23028886_s4	Furthermore , we investigated the importance of AKT and ERK signaling in DV-induced VEGF expression and secretion .	
23028886_s5	We show that DV increases the phosphorylation of ERK , which leads to subsequent activation and stabilization of eIF4E and HIF-1Î± .	
23028886_s6	Inhibition of ERK activity by U0126 suppressed DV-induced expression and secretion of VEGR in BECs .	inducing angiogenesis
23028886_s7	While DV was capable of phosphorylating AKT we show that AKT phosphorylation does not play a role in DV's induction of VEGF expression or secretion using two separate inhibitors , LY294002 and Akt IV .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23028886_s8	Lastly , we demonstrate that VEGF activity is critical for DV increases in BEC proliferation , as well as angiogenesis in a BEC-neuronal co-culture system .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23028886_s9	Collectively , our findings expand our understanding of DV's mechanism of action on BECs , and further support its potential as a novel stroke therapy .	
23028984_s0	Although tumor-associated macrophages ( TAMs ) are involved in tumor growth and metastasis , the mechanisms controlling their pro-tumoral activities remain largely unknown .	
23028984_s1	The transcription factor c-MYC has been recently shown to regulate in vitro human macrophage polarization and be expressed in macrophages infiltrating human tumors .	
23028984_s2	In this study , we exploited the predominant expression of LysM in myeloid cells to generate c-Myc(fl/fl) LysM(cre/+) mice , which lack c-Myc in macrophages , to investigate the role of macrophage c-MYC expression in cancer .	
23028984_s3	Under steady-state conditions , immune system parameters in c-Myc(fl/fl) LysM(cre/+) mice appeared normal , including the abundance of different subsets of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells , precursors and circulating cells , macrophage density , and immune organ structure .	avoiding immune destruction
23028984_s4	In a model of melanoma , however , TAMs lacking c-Myc displayed a delay in maturation and showed an attenuation of pro-tumoral functions ( e.g. , reduced expression of VEGF , MMP9 , and HIF1Î± ) that was associated with impaired tissue remodeling and angiogenesis and limited tumor growth in c-Myc(fl/fl) LysM(cre/+) mice .	
23028984_s5	Macrophage c-Myc deletion also diminished fibrosarcoma growth .	
23028984_s6	These data identify c-Myc as a positive regulator of the pro-tumoral program of TAMs and suggest c-Myc inactivation as an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy .	
23030360_s0	The SR/CR mouse phenotype , first described in 1999 in BALB/c and later bred into C57BL/6 mice , is resistant to cancer formation following high doses of cancer cells administered intraperitoneally .	
23030360_s1	The tumor cell targeting and destruction mechanisms have not been identified .	
23030360_s2	By fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis , the immune response of SR/CR mice after intraperitoneal injection of cancer cells was investigated and compared with parent strain mice .	
23030360_s3	A massive influx of leukocytes into the peritoneal cavity was found .	
23030360_s4	A large fraction of these leukocytes were polymorphonuclear granulocytes , macrophages and natural killer cells .	
23030360_s5	A relative decrease in influx of B-cells compared with controls was demonstrated .	
23030360_s6	Increased proportions of leukocytes belonging to the innate immune system were also demonstrated in splenocytes of SR/CR mice .	avoiding immune destruction
23030360_s7	Cytospins of peritoneal fluid from SR/CR mice after cancer cell injection showed formations of immune cells morphologically resembling polymorphonuclear granulocytes and macrophages adjoining the cancer cells .	
23030360_s8	The results point to the potential involvement of innate immune cells in cancer immunology .	avoiding immune destruction
23030360_s9	Our data support migration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes , macrophages and NK cells into the peritoneum of the SR/CR mouse in response to intraperitoneal injection of S180 cancer cells .	
23030360_s10	The cell composition of spleens of SR/CR mice reflected the differential regulation of the innate immune cells in peritoneal exudates .	
23030360_s11	Both peritoneal exudates and the spleens of SR/CR mice contained decreased proportions of B-cells compared with BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice .	
23030360_s12	We reproduce important aspects of previous published data and further extend them by showing differentially regulated populations of splenocytes including B-lymphocytes in SR/CR mice compared with parent strain controls .	
23030360_s13	Importantly , this differentially regulated immune response of SR/CR mice could not be found in response to challenge with the lymphoma cell line EL-4 .	avoiding immune destruction
23039130_s0	BACKGROUND Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive form of malignant glioma and is very difficult to treat .	
23039130_s1	Controlling tumour cell invasion and angiogenesis is essential to improve the prognosis of glioblastoma patients .	
23039130_s2	Since constitutive activation of nuclear factor-ÎºB ( NF-ÎºB ) is necessary for tumour progression , NF-ÎºB may be an important pharmacological target for this disease .	
23039130_s3	Our study aimed to evaluate the antitumour effects of parthenolide , a NF-ÎºB inhibitor , in two human glioblastoma cell lines ( U87MG and U373 ) and in glioblastoma xenografts .	
23039130_s4	Furthermore , we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects .	
23039130_s5	METHODS The anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic effects of parthenolide were analysed using in vitro invasion and angiogenesis assays .	
23039130_s6	Parthenolide-induced growth inhibition of glioblastoma cells in vitro was determined using the MTT ( methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ) assay .	
23039130_s7	In addition , the effect of parthenolide on orthotropic implantation in vivo was evaluated using an intracerebral human glioblastoma xenograft model .	
23039130_s8	RESULTS We found that parthenolide suppresses proliferation , invasion , and tumour- induced angiogenesis of glioblastoma cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23039130_s9	Molecular studies demonstrated that parthenolide suppresses gene and protein expression of angiogenic factors .	inducing angiogenesis
23039130_s10	Furthermore , parthenolide reduced Akt phosphorylation and activated mitochondrial signalling , suggesting that the antitumour function of parthenolide may be mediated not only by the inhibition of NF-ÎºB but also by the inhibition of Akt signalling and the activation of apoptotic proteins .	resisting cell death
23039130_s11	Parthenolide suppressed neovascularity and tumour growth in glioblastoma xenografts .	
23039130_s12	CONCLUSION The present study identified parthenolide as a new therapeutic agent for glioblastomas .	
23041550_s0	Overexpression of cyclin D1 is believed to endow mammary epithelial cells ( MEC ) with a proliferative advantage by virtue of its contribution to pRB inactivation .	
23041550_s1	Accordingly , abrogation of the kinase-dependent function of cyclin D1 is sufficient to render mice resistant to breast cancer initiated by ErbB2 .	
23041550_s2	Here , we report that mouse cyclin D1(KE/KE) MECs ( deficient in cyclin D1 activity ) upregulate an autophagy-like process but fail to implement ErbB2-induced senescence in vivo .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
23041550_s3	In addition , immortalized cyclin D1(KE/KE) MECs retain high rates of autophagy and reduced ErbB2-mediated transformation in vitro .	
23041550_s4	However , highlighting its dual role during tumorigenesis , downregulation of autophagy led to an increase in senescence in cyclin D1(KE/KE) MECs .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
23041550_s5	Autophagy upregulation was also confirmed in human mammary epithelial cells ( HMEC ) subjected to genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of cyclin D1 activity and , similar to our murine system , simultaneous inhibition of Cdk4/6 and autophagy in HMECs enhanced the senescence response .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
23041550_s6	Collectively , our findings suggest a previously unrecognized function of cyclin D1 in suppressing autophagy in the mammary epithelium .	resisting cell death

23043761_s0	The orphan receptor TR3 is an important regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis .	
23043761_s1	However , whether TR3 is involved in regulating the stem-like properties of cancer cells remains unknown .	
23043761_s2	The present study shows that TR3 expression is increased in gastric tumorsphere cells and is positively correlated with cancer stem cell ( CSC ) characteristics .	
23043761_s3	Knocking down TR3 leads to the suppression of its stem-like properties in both gastric cancer cells and tumorsphere cells .	
23043761_s4	This process involves the decreased expression of the stemness-related genes Oct-4 and Nanog and the invasion-related gene MMP-9 .	activating invasion and metastasis
23043761_s5	We further identify Nanog as a new target for the transcription factor TR3 .	
23043761_s6	Together , these data demonstrate for the first time that TR3 is essential for the maintenance of stem-like properties in human gastric cancer cells and implicate TR3 as a new therapeutic target for gastric cancer .	
23045683_s0	The recent approval of a prostate cancer vaccine has renewed hope for anticancer immunotherapies .	
23045683_s1	However , the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment may limit the effectiveness of current immunotherapies .	
23045683_s2	Antiangiogenic agents have the potential to modulate the tumor microenvironment and improve immunotherapy , but they often are used at high doses in the clinic to prune tumor vessels and paradoxically may compromise various therapies .	
23045683_s3	Here , we demonstrate that targeting tumor vasculature with lower vascular-normalizing doses , but not high antivascular/antiangiogenic doses , of an anti-VEGF receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) antibody results in a more homogeneous distribution of functional tumor vessels .	inducing angiogenesis
23045683_s4	Furthermore , lower doses are superior to the high doses in polarizing tumor-associated macrophages from an immune inhibitory M2-like phenotype toward an immune stimulatory M1-like phenotype and in facilitating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell tumor infiltration .	avoiding immune destruction
23045683_s5	Based on this mechanism , scheduling lower-dose anti-VEGFR2 therapy with T-cell activation induced by a whole cancer cell vaccine therapy enhanced anticancer efficacy in a CD8(+) T-cell-dependent manner in both immune-tolerant and immunogenic murine breast cancer models .	
23045683_s6	These findings indicate that vascular-normalizing lower doses of anti-VEGFR2 antibody can reprogram the tumor microenvironment away from immunosuppression toward potentiation of cancer vaccine therapies .	avoiding immune destruction,inducing angiogenesis
23045683_s7	Given that the combinations of high doses of bevacizumab with chemotherapy have not improved overall survival of breast cancer patients , our study suggests a strategy to use antiangiogenic agents in breast cancer more effectively with active immunotherapy and potentially other anticancer therapies .	avoiding immune destruction,inducing angiogenesis
23045694_s0	Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) are considered to be the cell of origin of glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) .	
23045694_s1	However , the genetic alterations that transform NSCs into glioma-initiating cells remain elusive .	
23045694_s2	Using a unique transposon mutagenesis strategy that mutagenizes NSCs in culture , followed by additional rounds of mutagenesis to generate tumors in vivo , we have identified genes and signaling pathways that can transform NSCs into glioma-initiating cells .	
23045694_s3	Mobilization of Sleeping Beauty transposons in NSCs induced the immortalization of astroglial-like cells , which were then able to generate tumors with characteristics of the mesenchymal subtype of GBM on transplantation , consistent with a potential astroglial origin for mesenchymal GBM .	enabling replicative immortality
23045694_s4	Sequence analysis of transposon insertion sites from tumors and immortalized cells identified more than 200 frequently mutated genes , including human GBM-associated genes , such as Met and Nf1 , and made it possible to discriminate between genes that function during astroglial immortalization vs. later stages of tumor development .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
23045694_s5	We also functionally validated five GBM candidate genes using a previously undescribed high-throughput method .	
23045694_s6	Finally , we show that even clonally related tumors derived from the same immortalized line have acquired distinct combinations of genetic alterations during tumor development , suggesting that tumor formation in this model system involves competition among genetically variant cells , which is similar to the Darwinian evolutionary processes now thought to generate many human cancers .	
23045694_s7	This mutagenesis strategy is faster and simpler than conventional transposon screens and can potentially be applied to any tissue stem/progenitor cells that can be grown and differentiated in vitro .	genomic instability and mutation
23054118_s0	BACKGROUND : The immune system has been shown to play an important role in gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) .	
23054118_s1	The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) in blood is an easily assessable parameter of systemic inflammatory response .	
23054118_s2	The aim of this study was to determine whether the NLR is prognostic in GIST .	
23054118_s3	METHODS : A total of 339 previously untreated patients with primary , localized GIST operated at our institution between 1995 and 2010 were identified from a prospectively collected sarcoma database .	
23054118_s4	NLR was assessed preoperatively .	
23054118_s5	Patients who received adjuvant imatinib treatment were excluded from the analysis ( n=64 ) .	
23054118_s6	Cox regression models were calculated and correlation analyses were performed .	
23054118_s7	RESULTS : On univariate analysis , NLR was associated with recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) ( P=0.003 , hazard ratio 3.3 , 95% confidence interval 1.5-7.4 ) .	
23054118_s8	Patients with a low NLR had a 1- and 5-year RFS of 98 and 91% , compared with 89 and 76% in those with a high NLR .	
23054118_s9	The median RFS was not reached .	
23054118_s10	Positive correlations were found between NLR and mitotic rate ( Pearson correlation coefficient [ r]=0.15 , P=0.03 ) , and NLR and tumor size ( r=0.36 , P=0.0001 ) .	
23054118_s11	RFS in patients with a GIST&gt;5cm with low NLR was significantly longer compared to patients with high NLR ( P=0.002 ) .	
23054118_s12	Flow cytometry analysis of freshly obtained GISTs revealed that neutrophils constituted a minimal percentage of intratumoral immune cells .	avoiding immune destruction
23054118_s13	CONCLUSIONS : NLR is a surrogate for high-risk tumor features .	
23054118_s14	Elevated blood NLR appears to represent systemic inflammation in patients with high-risk GIST .	tumor promoting inflammation
23055201_s0	The epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a fundamental process governing morphogenesis in multicellular organisms and has recently been implicated in promoting carcinoma invasion and metastasis .	
23055201_s1	Besides their therapeutic effects , accumulating evidences suggest that chemotherapeutic agents also induced EMT and enhanced the malignancy of treated cancer cells ; however , the mechanism(s) still remains unclear .	
23055201_s2	Here , we investigated the role of Î²-catenin signaling in doxorubicin ( Dox)-induced EMT in human gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 .	
23055201_s3	We found that the transient treatment of Dox induced EMT and enhanced the in vitro migration ability of cancer cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23055201_s4	We also found that Î²-catenin signaling was activated upon Dox treatment .	
23055201_s5	Inhibition of Î²-catenin by indomethacin ( Indo ) or siRNA suppressed Dox-induced EMT and decreased cancer cell migration ability .	activating invasion and metastasis
23055201_s6	Our results showed that Î²-catenin signaling was critical to Dox-induced EMT .	
23055201_s7	Indo and other Î²-catenin inhibitors may have a potential implication in prevention of gastric cancer metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
23056300_s0	BACKGROUND Growth Regulation by Estrogen in Breast cancer ( GREB1 ) was an estrogen receptor ( ER ) target gene , and GREB1 expression inversely correlated with HER2 status , possibly as a surrogate marker for ER status and a predictor for tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer patients .	
23056300_s1	In the present study , we examine the function and regulation of GREB1 in breast cancer , with the goal to develop GREB1 as a biomarker in breast cancer with de novo and acquired tamoxifen resistance .	
23056300_s2	METHODS We overexpressed GREB1 using adenovirus containing the full length GREB1 cDNA ( Ad-GREB1 ) in breast cancer cell lines .	
23056300_s3	The soft agar assay was used as a measure of anchorage independent growth .	
23056300_s4	The effects of GREB1 on cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells transduced with Ad-GREB1 were also measured by the me olic activity using AlamarBlue assay .	
23056300_s5	We tested whether there was interaction between STAT3 and ER , which could repress GREB1 expression by immunoprecipitation assay .	
23056300_s6	The effects of IL-6/JAK/STAT3 cascade activation on estrogen-induced GREB1 promoter activity were determined by luciferase assay and those on gene expression were measured by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) .	
23056300_s7	RESULTS We found that the ability of breast cancer cells to grow in soft agar is enhanced following GREB1 transfection .	
23056300_s8	In MCF-7 cells transduced with Ad-GREB1 or transfected with siRNA GREB1 , the metabolic activity was increased or completely abolished , suggesting that GREB1 may function as a growth promoter in breast cancer .	
23056300_s9	E2 treatment increased GREB1 promoter luciferase activity .	
23056300_s10	IL-6 inhibited E2-induced GREB1 transcription activity and GREB1 mRNA expression .	
23056300_s11	Constitutively expressing active STAT3 construct ( STAT3-C ) dramatically decreased GREB1 transcription .	
23056300_s12	CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that overexpression of GREB1 promotes cell proliferation and increases the clonogenic ability in breast cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23056300_s13	Moreover , Il6/STAT3 modulates estrogen-induced GREB1 transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23063526_s0	Widespread changes in gene expression drive tumorigenesis , yet our knowledge of how aberrant epigenomic and transcriptome profiles arise in cancer cells is poorly understood .	
23063526_s1	Here , we demonstrate that metabolic transformation plays an important role .	
23063526_s2	Butyrate is the primary energy source of normal colonocytes and is metabolized to acetyl-CoA , which was shown to be important not only for energetics but also for HAT activity .	cellular energetics
23063526_s3	Due to the Warburg effect , cancerous colonocytes rely on glucose as their primary energy source , so butyrate accumulated and functioned as an HDAC inhibitor .	
23063526_s4	Although both mechanisms increased histone acetylation , different target genes were upregulated .	
23063526_s5	Consequently , butyrate stimulated the proliferation of normal colonocytes and cancerous colonocytes when the Warburg effect was prevented from occurring , whereas it inhibited the proliferation of cancerous colonocytes undergoing the Warburg effect .	cellular energetics
23063526_s6	These findings link a common metabolite to epigenetic mechanisms that are differentially utilized by normal and cancerous cells because of their inherent metabolic differences .	
23064360_s0	TNF , an inflammatory cytokine that is enriched in the tumor microenvironment , promotes tumor growth and subverts innate immune responses to cancer cells .	
23064360_s1	We previously reported that tumors implanted in TNF receptor-deficient ( Tnfr-/- ) mice are spontaneously rejected ; however , the molecular mechanisms underlying this rejection are unclear .	
23064360_s2	Here we report that TNF signaling drives the peripheral accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) .	
23064360_s3	MDSCs expand extensively during inflammation and tumor progression in mice and humans and can enhance tumor growth by repressing T cell-mediated antitumor responses .	tumor promoting inflammation
23064360_s4	Peripheral accumulation of MDSCs was drastically impaired in Tnfr-/- mice .	
23064360_s5	Signaling of TNFR-2 , but not TNFR-1 , promoted MDSC survival through upregulation of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein ( c-FLIP ) and inhibition of caspase-8 activity .	
23064360_s6	Loss of TNFRs impaired the induction of MDSCs from bone marrow cells , but this could be reversed by treatment with caspase inhibitors .	
23064360_s7	These results demonstrate that TNFR-2 signaling promotes MDSC survival and accumulation and helps tumor cells evade the immune system .	tumor promoting inflammation
23065281_s0	This study intended to investigate the expression of the ZEB1 and E-cadherin proteins in lung squamous cell carcinoma ( LSCC ) tissues and to examine the clinicopathological correlation between protein levels and LSCC .	
23065281_s1	RT-PCR and Western blot were used to examine the expression of ZEB1 and E-cadherin mRNAs and proteins in LSCC tissues as well as in adjacent normal tissues , and then analyze the relationship between the clinicopathological characteristics and the expression changes of ZEB1 and E-cadherin mRNAs in LSCC .	
23065281_s2	In addition , RNAi was used to knockdown the expression of the ZEB1 gene in Human HCC827 cells ; subsequently , changes in the invasive ability of the resultant cells were studied .	
23065281_s3	The positive rates of ZEB1 and E-cadherin mRNAs in LSCC tissues were 69.2 and 38.5% , respectively .	
23065281_s4	They differed significantly from the corresponding positive rates in the adjacent normal lung tissues ( 15.4 and 80.8% , p&lt;0.05 ) .	
23065281_s5	There was a negative correlation between the protein levels of ZEB1 and E-cadherin in LSCC tissues ( r=-0.714 , p&lt;0.001 ) ; in addition , it was found that ZEB1 protein expression in LSCC tissues was significantly higher than that in the neighboring normal lung tissues ( p&lt;0.05 ) , and its expression was also significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastases and distant metastases compared to those patients without metastatic disease ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23065281_s6	On the contrary , E-cadherin expression was significantly lower in LSCC tissues than that in the neighboring normal tissue ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	
23065281_s7	It was lower in patients with lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis compared to patients without metastatic disease ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23065281_s8	However , the expression of ZEB1 and E-cadherin was independent of gender , age , tumor size , or tumor differentiation level ( p&gt;0.05 ) .	
23065281_s9	Transfection of ZEB1 siRNA into HCC827 cells significantly reduced the ZEB1 protein level ( p&lt;0.01 ) and significantly elevated E-cadherin levels ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	
23065281_s10	Moreover , significantly less ZEB1 siRNA-transfected cells migrated through Transwell chambers in the LSCC tissue than that in the control groups ( untransfected or transfected with control siRNA , p&lt;0.01 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23065281_s11	The expression of the ZEB1 gene in LSCC tissues is downregulated with the expression of E-cadherin .	
23065281_s12	On the other hand , the expression of siRNA against ZEB1 promotes E-cadherin expression and suppresses the invasive ability conferred by E-cadherin .	activating invasion and metastasis
23065281_s13	In conclusion , our data suggested that overexpression of the ZEB1 gene is possibly associated with the occurrence , development , invasion of LSCC .	activating invasion and metastasis
23073801_s0	This study examined the possible role of p120ctn in the pathogenesis and development of pancreatic cancer .	
23073801_s1	PANC-1 cells , a kind of human pancreatic carcinoma cell line , were cultured in this study. p120ctn was immunocytochemically detected in PANC-1 cells .	
23073801_s2	The recombinant lentivirus vector was constructed to knock down the p120ctn expression of PANC-1 cells .	
23073801_s3	Real-time quantitative PCR ( RQ-PCR ) and Western blotting were used to determine the expression of p120ctn and E-cadherin in PANC-1 cells after p120ctn knockdown .	
23073801_s4	The adhesion , invasion and migration capacity of PANC-1 cells after p120ctn knockdown was detected by cell adhesion , invasion and migration assays .	
23073801_s5	Cell growth was measured by the MTT method .	
23073801_s6	Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting .	
23073801_s7	The results showed that p120ctn knockdown led to significantly down-regulated E-cadherin and a reduced cell-to-cell adhesion ability in PANC-1 cells. shRNA-mediated knockdown of p120ctn reduced invasion and migration capacity of PANC-1 cells , inhibited cell growth , caused a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in G(1) , an increase in S , and promoted apoptosis of PANC-1 cells .	
23073801_s8	It was concluded that p120ctn plays a pivotal role in the proliferation and metastasis of pancreatic carcinoma , suggesting that p120ctn is a novel target for pancreatic carcinoma treatment .	activating invasion and metastasis
23082126_s0	Cancer can be envisioned as a metabolic disease driven by pressure selection and intercellular cooperativeness .	
23082126_s1	Together with anaerobic glycolysis , the Warburg effect , formally corresponding to uncoupling glycolysis from oxidative phosphorylation , directly participates in cancer aggressiveness , supporting both tumor progression and dissemination .	
23082126_s2	The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) is a key contributor to glycolysis .	
23082126_s3	It stimulates the expression of glycolytic transporters and enzymes supporting high rate of glycolysis .	
23082126_s4	In this study , we addressed the reverse possibility of a metabolic control of HIF-1 in tumor cells .	
23082126_s5	We report that lactate , the end-product of glycolysis , inhibits prolylhydroxylase 2 activity and activates HIF-1 in normoxic oxidative tumor cells but not in Warburg-phenotype tumor cells which also expressed lower basal levels of HIF-1α .	cellular energetics
23082126_s6	These data were confirmed using genotypically matched oxidative and mitochondria-depleted glycolytic tumor cells as well as several different wild-type human tumor cell lines of either metabolic phenotype .	
23082126_s7	Lactate activates HIF-1 and triggers tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo , an activity that we found to be under the specific upstream control of the lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 ( MCT1 ) expressed in tumor cells .	inducing angiogenesis
23082126_s8	Because MCT1 also gates lactate-fueled tumor cell respiration and mediates pro-angiogenic lactate signaling in endothelial cells , MCT1 inhibition is confirmed as an attractive anticancer strategy in which a single drug may target multiple tumor-promoting pathways .	cellular energetics,inducing angiogenesis
23082676_s0	A metaphase chromosome analysis method was used to evaluate the mutagenic activity of volatile petroleum fractions in chronically intoxicated rats .	
23082676_s1	The findings indicate that chronic inhalation exposure of the rats to volatile petroleum fractions at different concentrations results in a significant ( 2.5-fold ) increase , compared to the spontaneous level , in the occurrence of chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow cells in a number of generations .	genomic instability and mutation
23082676_s2	In addition to chromosomal structural abnormalities , there are genomic changes ( aneuploidy , polyploidy ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23082676_s3	There is a tendency towards an increased rate of petroleum-induced chromosomal aberrations in a number of generations ( P , F1 , and F2 ) in the rat bone marrow cells .	genomic instability and mutation
23082676_s4	The maximum mutagenic effect of volatile petroleum fractions was found when used at concentrations of 10 and 100 mg/l upon long-term chronic exposure during three generations ( P1 , F1 , and F2 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23082676_s5	The findings are indicative of the mutagenic activity of volatile petroleum fractions , which is likely to pose a potential risk from environmental pollution to biota and population health in the area of intensive oil extraction and refining .	genomic instability and mutation
23083134_s0	BACKGROUND Patients with invasive breast ductal carcinoma ( IBDC ) with metastasis have a very poor prognosis .	
23083134_s1	Little is known about the synergistic action of growth and inflammatory factors in IBDC metastases .	
23083134_s2	METHODS The expression of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 ( phosphorylated or p-ERK1/2 ) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in IBDC tissue samples from 80 cases .	
23083134_s3	BT474 IBDC cell migration and invasion were quantified using the Transwell assay .	
23083134_s4	Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 expression and activity were analyzed by RT-PCR , Western blotting and zymography .	
23083134_s5	Activator protein ( AP)-1 activity was measured with a luciferase reporter gene assay .	
23083134_s6	The Wilcoxon signed-rank test , Chi-square test , the partition of Chi-square test , independent t-test , and Spearman's method were used for the statistical analysis .	
23083134_s7	RESULTS Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected in 58/80 ( 72.5% ) IBDC tissues , and was associated with higher TNM stage and lymph node metastasis , but not patient age or tumor size .	activating invasion and metastasis
23083134_s8	Individually , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , and interleukin ( IL)-1Î² activated ERK1/2 , increased cell migration and invasion , MMP-9 expression and activity , AP-1 activation in vitro and the expression of p-ERK1/2 was positively correlated with EGF expression levels , as well as IL-1Î² , MMP-9 and c-fos in IBDC tissue samples .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23083134_s9	Co-stimulation with EGF and IL-1Î² synergistically increased ERK1/2 and AP-1 activation , cell migration and invasion , and MMP-9 expression and activity .	activating invasion and metastasis
23083134_s10	Inhibition of ERK1/2 using U0126 or siRNA abolished EGF and/or IL-1Î²-induced cell migration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner .	activating invasion and metastasis
23083134_s11	CONCLUSION Activated ERK1/2 was associated with higher TNM stage and lymph node metastasis in IBDC .	activating invasion and metastasis
23083134_s12	Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that ERK-1/2 activation may increase the metastatic ability of IBDC cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23083134_s13	Growth and inflammatory factors synergistically induced IBDC cell migration and invasion via ERK1/2 signaling , AP-1 activation and MMP-9 upregulation .	activating invasion and metastasis,tumor promoting inflammation
23083876_s0	PURPOSE Recently , a new renal cell cancer syndrome has been linked to germline mutation of multiple subunits ( SDHB/C/D ) of the Krebs cycle enzyme , succinate dehydrogenase .	
23083876_s1	We report our experience with the diagnosis , evaluation and treatment of this novel form of hereditary kidney cancer .	
23083876_s2	MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with suspected hereditary kidney cancer were enrolled on a National Cancer Institute institutional review board approved protocol to study inherited forms of kidney cancer .	
23083876_s3	Individuals from families with germline SDHB , SDHC and SDHD mutations , and kidney cancer underwent comprehensive clinical and genetic evaluation .	
23083876_s4	RESULTS A total of 14 patients from 12 SDHB mutation families were evaluated .	
23083876_s5	Patients presented with renal cell cancer at an early age ( 33 years , range 15 to 62 ) , metastatic kidney cancer developed in 4 and some families had no manifestation other than kidney tumors .	activating invasion and metastasis
23083876_s6	An additional family with 6 individuals found to have clear cell renal cell cancer that presented at a young average age ( 47 years , range 40 to 53 ) was identified with a germline SDHC mutation ( R133X ) Metastatic disease developed in 2 of these family members .	genomic instability and mutation
23083876_s7	A patient with a history of carotid body paragangliomas and an aggressive form of kidney cancer was evaluated from a family with a germline SDHD mutation .	genomic instability and mutation
23083876_s8	CONCLUSIONS SDH mutation associated renal cell carcinoma can be an aggressive type of kidney cancer , especially in younger individuals .	genomic instability and mutation
23083876_s9	Although detection and management of early tumors is most often associated with a good outcome , based on our initial experience with these patients and our long-term experience with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma , we recommend careful surveillance of patients at risk for SDH mutation associated renal cell carcinoma and wide surgical excision of renal tumors .	
23085987_s0	Premature senescence , a key strategy used to suppress carcinogenesis , can be driven by p53/p21 proteins in response to various stresses .	
23085987_s1	Here , we demonstrate that Wig1 plays a critical role in this process through regulation of p21 mRNA stability .	
23085987_s2	Wig1 controls the association of Argonaute2 ( Ago2 ) , a central component of the RNA-induced silencing complex ( RISC ) , with target p21 mRNA via binding of the stem-loop structure near the microRNA ( miRNA ) target site .	
23085987_s3	Depletion of Wig1 prohibited miRNA-mediated p21 mRNA decay and resulted in premature senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
23085987_s4	Wig1 plays an essential role in cell proliferation , as demonstrated in tumour xenografts in mice , and Wig1 and p21 mRNA levels are inversely correlated in human normal and cancer tissues .	
23085987_s5	Together , our data indicate a novel role of Wig1 in RISC target accessibility , which is a key step in RNA-mediated gene silencing .	
23085987_s6	In addition , these findings indicate that fine-tuning of p21 levels by Wig1 is essential for the prevention of cellular senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
23089469_s0	Alteration of the oxidative stress of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells can influence the expressions of genes favored angiogenesis .	
23089469_s1	Quinone reductase 2 which can activate quinones leading to reactive oxygen species production is a melatonin receptor known as MT3 .	
23089469_s2	Prazosin prescribed for benign prostate hyperplasia and hypertension is a potent antagonist for MT3 .	
23089469_s3	This study was to investigate the influence of therapeutic concentrations of prazosin ( 0.01 and 0.1Î¼M ) on cell proliferation and differential expressions of CCL2 , CCL20 , CXCL6 , CXCL10 , IL8 and IL6 genes related to inflammation and/or oxidative stress in human HCC cell lines .	
23089469_s4	Two HCC cell lines including one without susceptible to amphotericin B-induced oxidative stress ( cell line A ; HCC24/KMUH ) and one with this effect ( cell line B ; HCC38/KMUH ) were investigated by 0.01 and 0.1Î¼M prazosin .	
23089469_s5	The premixed WST-1 cell proliferation reagent was applied for proliferation assay .	
23089469_s6	Differential expressions of genes were examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction .	
23089469_s7	Our results showed that both 0.01 and 0.1Î¼M prazosin did not influence cell proliferation in both cell lines .	
23089469_s8	Both 0.01 and 0.1Î¼M prazosin in cell line A and 0.01Î¼M prazosin in cell line B did not cause differential expressions of tested genes .	
23089469_s9	However , 0.1Î¼M prazosin caused remarkable up-regulation of IL6 gene and slightly up-regulation of CCL2 gene in cell line B. In conclusion , high therapeutic concentration of prazosin can up-regulate angiogenic IL6 and CCL2 genes in human HCC cells susceptible to amphotericin B-induced oxidative stress .	inducing angiogenesis,tumor promoting inflammation
23089469_s10	Clinical application of prazosin in patients with HCC should consider this possibility .	
23091651_s0	Centrosome overduplication or amplification has been observed in many human cancers and in premalignant tissue , but the mechanisms leading to such centrosome aberrations are not fully understood .	
23091651_s1	We previously showed that abnormal mitotic cells with supernumerary centrosomes increase with replicative senescence in human fibroblasts , especially in a polyploid subpopulation .	
23091651_s2	This study examines localization of p53 protein at centrosomes in mitotic cells , which is often observed in association with DNA damage response , to investigate a possible association between p53 localization and numerical centrosome aberrations induced by cellular senescence .	
23091651_s3	Cultures at later passages or the 4th day after exposure to H(2)O(2) showed increased frequencies of mitotic cells with supernumerary centrosomes , especially in a polyploid subpopulation .	
23091651_s4	Immunohistochemical analysis frequently showed p53-positive foci in mitotic cells , and some were localized at centrosomes .	
23091651_s5	The number of p53-positive foci in mitotic cells and its localization to centrosomes increased with replicative and premature senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
23091651_s6	Supernumerary centrosomes showed higher frequencies of p53 localization compared to normally duplicated centrosomes .	
23091651_s7	Centrosome-associated p53 protein was phosphorylated at Ser15 .	
23091651_s8	These data suggest a possible association between localization of p53 protein and numerical centrosome aberrations in replicatively or prematurely senescent cells .	enabling replicative immortality
23091717_s0	Purpose .	
23091717_s1	The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a new PET tracer ( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) for imaging of tumor angiogenesis using gene expression of angiogenesis markers as reference and to estimate radiation dosimetry for humans .	
23091717_s2	Procedures .	
23091717_s3	Nude mice with human neuroendocrine tumor xenografts ( H727 ) were administered ( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) i.v. for study of biodistribution as well as for dynamic PET .	
23091717_s4	Gene expression of angiogenesis markers integrin Î±(V) , integrin Î²(3) , and VEGF-A were analyzed using QPCR and correlated to the tracer uptake in the tumors ( %ID/g ) .	
23091717_s5	From biodistribution data human radiation-absorbed doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM .	
23091717_s6	Results .	
23091717_s7	Tumor uptake was 1.2%ID/g with strong correlations between gene expression and tracer uptake , for integrin Î±(V)âR = 0.76 , integrin Î²(3)âR = 0.75 and VEGF-A R = 0.81 ( all P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
23091717_s8	The whole body effective dose for humans was estimated to be 0.038 and 0.029âmSv/MBq for females and males , respectively , with highest absorbed dose in bladder wall .	
23091717_s9	Conclusion .	
23091717_s10	( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) is a promising new angiogenesis PET tracer with potential for human use .	inducing angiogenesis
23092099_s0	Cytokine-dependent cell lines have been used to analyze the cytokine-induced cellular signaling and the mechanism of oncogenesis .	
23092099_s1	In the current study , we analyzed MOTN-1 and PLT-2 cell lines established from different stages of a T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia patient ( Daibata et al. 2004 ) .	
23092099_s2	MOTN-1 is IL-2-dependent derived from the chronic phase , whereas IL-2-independent PLT-2 is from the aggressive and terminal stage .	
23092099_s3	They shared considerable chromosome abnormalities and the pattern of T-cell receptor rearrangement , presuming that the cytokine independence of PLT-2 was due to the additive genetic abnormality .	
23092099_s4	Besides IL-2 , IL-15 supported MOTN-1 cell growth , because these receptors share beta- and gamma-subunits .	
23092099_s5	IL-2 activated ERK , AKT and STAT pathway of MOTN-1 .	
23092099_s6	STAT3 pathway of PLT-2 was also activated by IL-2 , suggesting intact IL-2 induces signal transduction of PLT-2 .	
23092099_s7	However , ERK1/2 but not AKT , was continuously activated in PLT-2 , consistent with the increased Ras-activity of PLT-2 .	
23092099_s8	Sequence analysis revealed KRAS G12A mutation but not NRAS and HRAS mutation of PLT-2 but not MOTN-1 .	genomic instability and mutation
23092099_s9	Another signaling molecule affecting Ras-signaling pathway , SHP2 , which has been frequently mutated in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia ( JMML ) , did not show mutation .	genomic instability and mutation
23092099_s10	Moreover , MEK inhibitor , PD98059 , as well as farnesylation inhibitor inhibited PLT-2 cell growth .	
23092099_s11	Using NIH3T3 and MOTN-1 , ERK activation , increased cell proliferation and survival by KRAS G12A were shown , suggesting the important role of KRAS G12A in IL-2-independent growth of PLT-2 .	
23092099_s12	Taken together , KRAS G12A is important for IL-2-independent growth of PLT-2 cells and suggests the possibility of involvement of KRAS mutation with disease progression .	genomic instability and mutation
23092556_s0	Angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT1R ) promotes tumor invasion , migration , metastasis and angiogenesis .	
23092556_s1	We explored the potential antitumor effects of AT1R antagonists in breast cancer .	
23092556_s2	We found that angiotensin II promoted cell proliferation and upregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) in MCF-7 cells .	inducing angiogenesis
23092556_s3	Losartan downregulated the expression of VEGF-A in MCF-7 cells treated with angiotensin II .	inducing angiogenesis
23092556_s4	Candesartan downregulated the expression of VEGF-A in mice bearing MCF-7 xenografts and inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
23092556_s5	AT1R and VEGF-A expression correlated with increased microvascular density in 102 breast cancer patients .	inducing angiogenesis
23092556_s6	Our data suggest that AT1R antagonists might be useful to suppress breast cancer by inhibiting the angiotensin II .	inducing angiogenesis
23098476_s0	The CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell ( Treg ) is a special kind of T cell subset .	
23098476_s1	Studies have showed that Treg cells are involved in a number of physiological processes and pathologic conditions such as autoimmune diseases , transplantation tolerance and cancer .	
23098476_s2	Tregs with unique capacity for immune inhibition can impair anti-tumour immunity and help tumor cells to escape from immune surveillance .	
23098476_s3	The aim of our study was to investigate whether Tregs are involved in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) .	
23098476_s4	A BABL/C mouse with HCC in situ model was established to evaluate the Treg existence in carcinoma tissues and the changes of Tregs in spleen using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry methods .	
23098476_s5	Granzyme B expression in carcinoma tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry to investigate the tumor local immune status .	
23098476_s6	The proportion of CD4+CD25+/CD4+ spleen lymphocytes of tumor bearing mice ( 18.8% ï¿½ 1.26% ) was found to be significantly higher than that in normal mice ( 9.99% ï¿½ 1.90% ) ( P&lt;0.01 ) .	avoiding immune destruction
23098476_s7	Immunohistochemistry of spleen tissue also confirmed that there was an increase in Treg in tumor-bearing mice , while in carcinomas it showed Treg cells to be present in tumor infiltrating lymphocyte areas while Granzyme B was rarely observed .	
23098476_s8	Anti-tumour immunity was suppressed , and this might be associated with the increase of Tregs .	avoiding immune destruction
23098476_s9	Our observations suggest that the CD4+CD25+Treg/ CD4+ proportion in spleen lymphocytes can be a sensitive index to evaluate the change of Tregs in hepatocellular carcinoma mice and the Treg may be a promising therapeutic target for cancer .	
23100610_s0	OBJECTIVE To evaluate the risk factors for sentinel lymph node metastasis and validate the value of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram for the prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients .	
23100610_s1	METHODS A sentinel lymph node biopsy database containing 1227 consecutive breast cancer patients ( 416 patients with at least one positive sentinel lymph node ) was retrospectively analyzed .	
23100610_s2	The predictive value of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram was calculated by the trend line and the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve .	
23100610_s3	Meanwhile , predictors for sentinel lymph node metastasis were also evaluated .	
23100610_s4	RESULTS Tumor size , histological grade , lymphovascular invasion , mulifocality , estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status were significant independent predictors for sentinel lymph node metastasis ( all P&lt;0.01 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23100610_s5	The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram presented an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve value of 0.730 .	
23100610_s6	Patients with predictive value&lt;16% had a frequency of sentinel lymph node metastasis of 0.9% .	activating invasion and metastasis
23100610_s7	Those with values larger than 70% had a frequency of 96.2% .	
23100610_s8	CONCLUSIONS The risk factors for sentinel lymph node metastasis in our study were consistent with those in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram .	activating invasion and metastasis
23100610_s9	The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram is a useful tool that could accurately predict the probability of sentinel lymph node metastasis in our breast cancer patients .	activating invasion and metastasis
23100610_s10	Axillary surgical staging might be avoided in patients with a predictive value of &lt;16% and axillary lymph node dissection might be done directly in those with a predictive value &gt;70% , while other patients should still accept sentinel lymph node biopsy .	
23104055_s0	The topoisomerase II ( topo II ) DNA incision-and-ligation cycle can be poisoned ( for example following treatment with cancer chemotherapeutics ) to generate cytotoxic DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) with topo II covalently conjugated to DNA .	
23104055_s1	Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 ( Tdp2 ) protects genomic integrity by reversing 5'-phosphotyrosyl-linked topo II-DNA adducts .	
23104055_s2	Here , X-ray structures of mouse Tdp2-DNA complexes reveal that Tdp2 β-2-helix-β DNA damage-binding ' grasp ' , helical ' cap ' and DNA lesion-binding elements fuse to form an elongated protein-DNA conjugate substrate-interaction groove .	genomic instability and mutation
23104055_s3	The Tdp2 DNA-binding surface is highly tailored for engagement of 5'-adducted single-stranded DNA ends and restricts nonspecific endonucleolytic or exonucleolytic processing .	
23104055_s4	Structural , mutational and functional analyses support a single-metal ion catalytic mechanism for the exonuclease-endonuclease-phosphatase ( EEP ) nuclease superfamily and establish a molecular framework for targeted small-molecule blockade of Tdp2-mediated resistance to anticancer topoisomerase drugs .	genomic instability and mutation
23108138_s0	The relevance of many BRCA2 variants of uncertain significance ( VUS ) to breast cancer has not been determined due to limited genetic information from families carrying these alterations .	
23108138_s1	Here , we classified six new variants as pathogenic or nonpathogenic by analysis of genetic information from families carrying 64 individual BRCA2 DNA binding domain ( DBD ) missense mutations using a multifactorial likelihood model of cancer causality .	
23108138_s2	Next , we evaluated the use of a homology-directed DNA break repair ( HDR ) functional assay as a method for inferring the clinical relevance of VUS in the DBD of BRCA2 using 18 established nonpathogenic missense variants and all 13 established pathogenic missense mutations from the BRCA2 DBD .	
23108138_s3	Compared with the known status of these variants based on the multifactorial likelihood model , the sensitivity of the HDR assay for pathogenic mutations was estimated at 100% [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) : 75.3%-100% ] and specificity was estimated at 100% ( 95% CI : 81.5%-100% ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23108138_s4	A statistical classifier for predicting the probability of pathogenicity of BRCA2 DBD variants was developed using these functional results .	
23108138_s5	When applied to 33 additional VUS , the classifier identified eight with 99% or more probability of nonpathogenicity and 18 with 99% or more probability of pathogenicity .	
23108138_s6	Thus , in the absence of genetic evidence , a cell-based HDR assay can provide a probability of pathogenicity for all VUS in the BRCA2 DBD , suggesting that the assay can be used in combination with other information to determine the cancer relevance of BRCA2 VUS .	
23109338_s0	Blockage of the metastasis process remains a significant clinical challenge , requiring innovative therapeutic approaches .	
23109338_s1	For this purpose , molecules that inhibit matrix metalloproteinases activity or induce the expression of their natural inhibitor , the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) , are potentially interesting .	
23109338_s2	In a previous study , we have shown that synthetic ligands binding to cell surface nucleolin/nucleophosmin and known as HB 19 for the lead compound and NucAnt 6L ( N6L ) for the most potent analog , inhibit both tumor growth and angiogenesis .	
23109338_s3	Furthermore , they prevent metastasis in a RET transgenic mice model which develops melanoma .	
23109338_s4	Here , we investigated the effect of N6L on the invasion capacity of MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells .	
23109338_s5	Our results show that the multivalent pseudopeptide N6L inhibited Matrigel invasion of MDA-MB-435 cells in a modified Boyden chamber model .	activating invasion and metastasis
23109338_s6	This was associated with an increase in TIMP-3 in the cell culture medium without a change in TIMP-3 mRNA expression suggesting its release from cell surface and/or extracellular matrix .	
23109338_s7	This may be explained by our demonstrated N6L interaction with sulfated glycosaminoglycans and consequently the controlled bioavailability of glycosaminoglycan-bound TIMP-3 .	
23109338_s8	The implication of TIMP-3 in N6L-induced inhibition of cell invasion was evidenced by siRNA silencing experiments showing that the loss of TIMP-3 expression abrogated the effect of N6L .	activating invasion and metastasis
23109338_s9	The inhibition of tumor cell invasion by N6L demonstrated in this study , in addition to its previously established inhibitory effect on tumor growth and angiogenesis , suggests that N6L represents a promising anticancer drug candidate warranting further investigation .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
23110475_s0	Melittin ( 1 ) is a major polypeptide in honey bee venom that has been used traditionally against chronic inflammation and cancer .	
23110475_s1	However , its molecular mechanism has not been determined .	
23110475_s2	In this study , the antitumor effect of 1 was compared with that of NS398 , a cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor , in vivo and in vitro .	
23110475_s3	Subcutaneous injection of 1 at 0.5 and 5 mg/kg suppressed significantly vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A-transfected highly metastatic Lewis lung cancer ( VEGF-A-hm LLC ) tumor growth by 25% and 57% , respectively .	
23110475_s4	Also , 1 inhibited significantly the number of vessels around VEGF-A-hm LLC cells .	
23110475_s5	The results were superior to those obtained in the mice treated with NS398 .	
23110475_s6	Compound 1 dose-dependently inhibited proliferation and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( VEGF-A-HUVECs ) , without affecting cell viability in native HUVECs .	inducing angiogenesis
23110475_s7	In addition , 1 decreased the expression of VEGF receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2 ) , COX-2 , and prostaglandin E(2) ( PGE(2) ) in VEGF-A-transfected HUVECs .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23110475_s8	These effects were accompanied by a reduction of the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and c-jun N-terminal kinase , whereas it increased the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23110475_s9	SB203580 abolished the downregulation of COX-2 and VEGFR-2 and the inhibition of cell proliferation by 1 .	
23110475_s10	The antitumor activity of 1 may be associated with antiangiogenic actions via inhibiting VEGFR-2 and inflammatory mediators involved in the MAPK signaling pathway .	inducing angiogenesis
23112334_s0	Although regulatory T cells ( T(regs) ) are known to suppress self-reactive autoimmune responses , their role during T cell responses to nonself antigens is not well understood .	
23112334_s1	We show that T(regs) play a critical role during the priming of immune responses in mice .	avoiding immune destruction
23112334_s2	T(reg) depletion induced the activation and expansion of a population of low-avidity CD8(+) T cells because of overproduction of CCL-3/4/5 chemokines , which stabilized the interactions between antigen-presenting dendritic cells and low-avidity T cells .	
23112334_s3	In the absence of T(regs) , the avidity of the primary immune response was impaired , which resulted in reduced memory to Listeria monocytogenes .	avoiding immune destruction
23112334_s4	These results suggest that T(regs) are important regulators of the homeostasis of CD8(+) T cell priming and play a critical role in the induction of high-avidity primary responses and effective memory .	
23116564_s0	Trabecular meshwork ( TM ) cells have widely been used as an invitro model for glaucoma research .	
23116564_s1	However , primary TM cells suffer the disadvantages of limited cell numbers and slow rates of proliferation .	
23116564_s2	We discovered a spontaneously transformed bovine TM ( BTM ) cell line , BTM-28T .	
23116564_s3	This cell line proliferated rapidly in low-glucose culture medium but also demonstrated contact inhibition in high-glucose culture medium .	evading growth suppressors
23116564_s4	BTM-28T cells expressed key TM cell markers including α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA ) , laminin and collagen IV ( col IV ) .	
23116564_s5	Also , 100nM dexamethasone ( DEX ) enhanced the formation of cross-linked actin networks ( CLANs ) in confluent BTM-28T cell cultures .	
23116564_s6	Transforming growth factor beta 2 ( TGFβ2 ) induced the expression of fibronectin ( FN ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) , and connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) in our cell cultures .	
23116564_s7	This cell line will be helpful to better understand the aqueous humor outflow pathway as related to the pathophysiology of glaucoma .	
23116821_s0	BACKGROUND Investigations concerned the mechanism of HT-29 cells radiosensitization by cis-9,trans-11-conjugated linoleic acid ( c9,t11-CLA ) , a natural component of human diet with proven antitumor activity .	
23116821_s1	METHODS The cells were incubated for 24h with 70μM c9,t11-CLA and then X-irradiated .	
23116821_s2	The following methods were used : gas chromatography ( incorporation of the CLA isomer ) , flow cytometry ( cell cycle ) , cloning ( survival ) , Western blotting ( protein distribution in membrane fractions ) , and pulse-field gel electrophoresis ( rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks ) .	
23116821_s3	In parallel , DNA-PK activity , γ-H2AX foci numbers and chromatid fragmentation were estimated .	
23116821_s4	Gene expression was analysed by RT-PCR and chromosomal aberrations by the mFISH method .	
23116821_s5	Nuclear accumulation of the EGF receptor ( EGFR ) was monitored by ELISA .	
23116821_s6	RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS C9,t11-CLA sensitized HT-29 cells to X-radiation .	
23116821_s7	This effect was not due to changes in cell cycle progression or DNA-repair-related gene expression .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
23116821_s8	Post-irradiation DSB rejoining was delayed , corresponding with the insufficient DNA-PK activation , although chromosomal aberration frequencies did not increase .	genomic instability and mutation
23116821_s9	Distributions of cholesterol and caveolin-1 in cellular membrane fractions changed .	
23116821_s10	The nuclear EGFR translocation , necessary to increase the DNA-PK activity in response to oxidative stress , was blocked .	sustaining proliferative signaling,tumor promoting inflammation
23116821_s11	We suppose that c9,t11-CLA modified the membrane structure , thus disturbing the intracellular EGFR transport and the EGFR-dependent pro-survival signalling , both functionally associated with lipid raft properties .	
23116821_s12	GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE The results point to the importance of the cell membrane interactions with the nucleus after injury inflicted by X -rays .	
23116821_s13	Compounds like c9,t11-CLA , that specifically alter membrane properties , could be used to develop new anticancer strategies .	
23117049_s0	Lung cancer is primarily caused by exposure to tobacco smoke .	
23117049_s1	Tobacco smoke contains numerous carcinogens , including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) .	
23117049_s2	The most common PAH studied is benzo[a]pyrene ( B[a]P ) .	
23117049_s3	B[a]P is metabolically activated through multiple routes , one of which is catalyzed by aldo-keto reductase ( AKR ) to B[a]P-7,8-dione ( BPQ ) .	
23117049_s4	BPQ undergoes a futile redox cycle in the presence of NADPH to generate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .	
23117049_s5	ROS , in turn , damages DNA .	
23117049_s6	Studies with a yeast p53 mutagenesis system found that the generation of ROS by PAH o-quinones may contribute to lung carcinogenesis because of similarities between the patterns ( types of mutations ) and spectra ( location of mutations ) and those seen in lung cancer .	
23117049_s7	The patterns were dominated by G to T transversions , and the spectra in the experimental system have mutations at lung cancer hotspots .	
23117049_s8	To address repair mechanisms that are responsible for BPQ induced damage we observed the effect of mutating two DNA repair genes OGG1 and APE1 ( APN1 in yeast ) and tested them in a yeast reporter system for p53 mutagenesis .	
23117049_s9	There was an increase in both the mutant frequency and the number of G:C/T:A transversions in p53 treated with BPQ in ogg1 yeast but not in apn1 yeast .	genomic instability and mutation
23117049_s10	Knocking out APN2 increased mutagenesis in the apn1 cells .	genomic instability and mutation
23117049_s11	In addition , we did not find a strand bias on p53 treated with BPQ in ogg1 yeast .	
23117049_s12	These studies suggest that Ogg1 is involved in repairing the oxidative damage caused by BPQ , Apn1 and Apn2 have redundant functions and that the stand bias seen in lung cancer may not be due to impaired repair of oxidative lesions .	genomic instability and mutation
23123564_s0	Molecular mechanisms involved in progression of clear-cell renal-cell carcinomas ( ccRCCs ) are poorly understood .	
23123564_s1	A common genetic mutation found in ccRCC is the loss of the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) gene , which contributes to cancer progression and metastasis .	
23123564_s2	We investigated VIP effects on metastatic and angiogenic factors in human VHL-null A498 ccRCC and HK2 renal cells .	
23123564_s3	VIP increased adhesion but decreased expression of metalloproteinases , MMP2 and MMP9 , as well as cell migration and VEGF expression and secretion in A498 but not in HK2 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
23123564_s4	VIP enhanced ROS levels and decreased nuclear levels of Î²-catenin and NFÎºB p50-subunit in A498 cells , suggesting neuropeptide involvement in the observed decrease of metastatic ability in clear-cell carcinoma .	activating invasion and metastasis,tumor promoting inflammation
23123564_s5	VIP effects in A498 cells were blocked by the VPAC(1/2)-receptor antagonist JV-1-53 .	
23123564_s6	In conclusion , present data point to a role of VIP in preventing invasion and metastasis in ccRCCs and support its potential therapeutic usefulness in this disease .	activating invasion and metastasis
23124112_s0	Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 ( UCP2 ) can moderate oxidative stress by favoring the influx of protons into the mitochondrial matrix , thus reducing electron leakage from respiratory chain and mitochondrial superoxide production .	
23124112_s1	Here , we demonstrate that UCP2 inhibition by genipin or UCP2 siRNA strongly increases reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production inhibiting pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell growth .	tumor promoting inflammation
23124112_s2	We also show that UCP2 inhibition triggers ROS-dependent nuclear translocation of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) , formation of autophagosomes , and the expression of the autophagy marker LC3-II .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23124112_s3	Consistently , UCP2 over-expression significantly reduces basal autophagy confirming the anti-autophagic role of UCP2 .	resisting cell death
23124112_s4	Furthermore , we demonstrate that autophagy induced by UCP2 inhibition determines a ROS-dependent cell death , as indicated by the apoptosis decrease in the presence of the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine ( CQ ) or 3-methyladenine ( 3-MA ) , or the radical scavenger NAC .	resisting cell death
23124112_s5	Intriguingly , the autophagy induced by genipin is able to potentiate the autophagic cell death triggered by gemcitabine , the standard chemotherapeutic drug for pancreatic adenocarcinoma , supporting the development of an anti-cancer therapy based on UCP2 inhibition associated to standard chemotherapy .	resisting cell death
23124112_s6	Our results demonstrate for the first time that UCP2 plays a role in autophagy regulation bringing new insights into mitochondrial uncoupling protein field .	resisting cell death
23126278_s0	Acrolein ( Acr ) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant found in cigarette smoke and automobile exhaust .	
23126278_s1	It can also be produced endogenously by oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids .	
23126278_s2	The Acr-derived 1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine ( Acr-dG ) adducts in DNA are mutagenic lesions that are potentially involved in human cancers .	
23126278_s3	In this study , monoclonal antibodies were raised against Acr-dG adducts and characterized using ELISA .	
23126278_s4	They showed strong reactivity and specificity toward Acr-dG , weaker reactivity toward crotonaldehyde- and trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-derived 1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosines , and weak or no reactivity toward 1,N(6)-ethenodeoxyadenosine and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine .	genomic instability and mutation
23126278_s5	Using these antibodies , we developed assays to detect Acr-dG in vivo : first , a simple and quick FACS-based assay for detecting these adducts directly in cells ; second , a highly sensitive direct ELISA assay for measuring Acr-dG in cells and tissues using only 1 μg of DNA without DNA digestion and sample enrichment ; and third , a competitive ELISA for better quantitative measurement of Acr-dG levels in DNA samples .	
23126278_s6	The assays were validated using Acr-treated HT29 cell DNA samples or calf thymus DNA , and the results were confirmed by LC-MS/MS-MRM .	
23126278_s7	An immunohistochemical assay was also developed to detect and visualize Acr-dG in HT29 cells as well as in human oral cells .	
23126278_s8	These antibody-based methods provide useful tools for the studies of Acr-dG as a cancer biomarker and of the molecular mechanisms by which cells respond to Acr-dG as a ubiquitous DNA lesion .	genomic instability and mutation
23127558_s0	The mammalian COP9 signalosome ( CSN ) complex is involved in cell transformation , but its molecular mechanism remains undetermined .	
23127558_s1	Here we show that disruption of the fifth component ( CSN5 ) prevented the formation of tumors by p53-null cells transformed with an active form of Ras in subcutaneously injected mice .	
23127558_s2	Depletion of CSN5 suppressed cell proliferation , and induced premature senescence characterized by upregulation of senescence-associated-Î²-galactosidase activity and increased expression of CDK inhibitors .	enabling replicative immortality
23127558_s3	CSN5-depleted cells exhibited enhanced activation of the PI3 kinase-Akt pathway , and chemical inhibition of this pathway reduced the level of senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
23127558_s4	Thus , CSN5 is suggested to be a novel target in cancer therapy and for drugs against tumor cells harboring mutated p53 .	genomic instability and mutation
23128449_s0	Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) and oxidative stress are closely linked .	
23128449_s1	Oxidative stress affects many signaling pathways and may cause the induction of autophagy .	
23128449_s2	The NF-E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 ( Keap1 ) signaling pathway is the main pathway responsible for cell defense against oxidative stress and Nrf2 is a critical transcription factor related with cancer multidrug resistance .	
23128449_s3	However , the relation between Nrf2 and regulation of autophagy is not well understood .	
23128449_s4	In this study , we used temozolomide ( TMZ ) , which inhibited the viability of GBM cells mainly by inducing autophagic cell death and explored the role of Nrf2 downregulation on autophagy induced by TMZ in GBM cells .	resisting cell death
23128449_s5	In U251-Si-Nrf2 48h after transfection the protein levels of Nrf2 were significantly downregulated , while the protein levels of LC3B-II increased by western blot analysis .	
23128449_s6	Knockdown of Nrf2 also led to a significant increase of autophagic vacuoles and acidic vesicular organelles ( AVOs ) , revealed by trans-mission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and acridine orange ( AO ) staining using flow cytometry .	resisting cell death
23128449_s7	Collectively , these findings demonstrate that knockdown of Nrf2 can enhance the basal level of autophagy in the U251 glioma cell line .	resisting cell death
23128449_s8	Furthermore , after the treatment with TMZ ( 100ÂµM ) for 3 days , the U251-Si-Nrf2 transfected cells showed less viability rate by cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) assay and the levels of autophagy increased obviously through analysis of western blot and AO staining using flow cytometry .	resisting cell death
23128449_s9	Taken together , our results suggest that knockdown of Nrf2 may enhance autophagy induced by TMZ in the U251 glioma cell line , which should be further evaluated for novel anticancer activity .	resisting cell death
23128605_s0	LewisY ( LeY ) antigen is an oligosaccharide that is highly expressed at the cell surface in various human cancers .	
23128605_s1	Increased LeY expression activates epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) and promotes cell proliferation in EGFR-overexpressing cells .	
23128605_s2	However , the effect of downregulation of LeY expression on cell proliferation in HER2-overexpressing cells remains unknown .	
23128605_s3	FUT1 encodes Î±1,2-fucosyltransferase , a key enzyme for LeY synthesis .	
23128605_s4	We knocked down FUT1 by short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) in four HER2-overexpressing human cancer cell lines , including NCI-N87 , MKN7 , SKBr3 and BT474 .	
23128605_s5	We investigated whether downregulation of LeY and alteration in the glycosylation status of these cells affect cell proliferation and HER2 activation .	
23128605_s6	Knocking down FUT1 expression markedly inhibited proliferation of NCI-N87 , which highly expressed EGFR and was sensitive to EGFR deprivation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23128605_s7	Furthermore , FUT1 siRNA downregulated the total amount of HER2 protein , phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR , and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) in this cell line .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23128605_s8	Moreover , the marked downregulation of phosphorylation of HER2 and ERK was observed following short-time EGF-stimulation .	
23128605_s9	These effects were not observed in the other three cell lines .	
23128605_s10	Our results suggest that knockdown of FUT1 downregulates HER2 signaling via EGFR downregulation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23128605_s11	FUT1 may serve as a new molecular target for HER2-overexpressing human cancers with activated EGFR signaling .	
23129611_s0	Blind mole rats Spalax ( BMR ) are small subterranean rodents common in the Middle East .	
23129611_s1	BMR is distinguished by its adaptations to life underground , remarkable longevity ( with a maximum documented lifespan of 21 y ) , and resistance to cancer .	
23129611_s2	Spontaneous tumors have never been observed in spalacids .	
23129611_s3	To understand the mechanisms responsible for this resistance , we examined the growth of BMR fibroblasts in vitro of the species Spalax judaei and Spalax golani .	
23129611_s4	BMR cells proliferated actively for 7-20 population doublings , after which the cells began secreting IFN-β , and the cultures underwent massive necrotic cell death within 3 d .	resisting cell death
23129611_s5	The necrotic cell death phenomenon was independent of culture conditions or telomere shortening .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
23129611_s6	Interestingly , this cell behavior was distinct from that observed in another long-lived and cancer-resistant African mole rat , Heterocephalus glaber , the naked mole rat in which cells display hypersensitivity to contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
23129611_s7	Sequestration of p53 and Rb proteins using SV40 large T antigen completely rescued necrotic cell death .	resisting cell death
23129611_s8	Our results suggest that cancer resistance of BMR is conferred by massive necrotic response to overproliferation mediated by p53 and Rb pathways , and triggered by the release of IFN-β .	resisting cell death
23129611_s9	Thus , we have identified a unique mechanism that contributes to cancer resistance of this subterranean mammal extremely adapted to life underground .	
23131583_s0	Chromosomal translocations typically impair cell differentiation and often require secondary mutations for malignant transformation .	
23131583_s1	However , the role of a primary translocation in the development of collaborating mutations is debatable .	
23131583_s2	To delineate the role of leukemic translocation NUP98-HOXD13 ( NHD13 ) in secondary mutagenesis , DNA break and repair mechanisms in stimulated mouse B lymphocytes expressing NHD13 were analyzed .	
23131583_s3	Our results showed significantly reduced expression of non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ)-mediated DNA repair genes , DNA Pkcs , DNA ligase4 , and Xrcc4 leading to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
23131583_s4	Our results showed that expression of NHD13 fusion gene resulted in impaired NHEJ-mediated DNA break repair .	genomic instability and mutation
23132960_s0	A prominent feature of inflammatory diseases is endothelial dysfunction .	
23132960_s1	Factors associated with endothelial dysfunction include proinflammatory cytokines , adhesion molecules , and matrix degrading enzymes .	
23132960_s2	At the transcriptional level , they are regulated by the histone deacetylase sirtuin ( SIRT ) 1 via its actions on the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-ÎºB ( NF-ÎºB ) .	
23132960_s3	The role of SIRT6 , also a histone deacetylase , in regulating inflammation in endothelial cells is not known .	
23132960_s4	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of SIRT6 knockdown on inflammatory markers in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) in the presence of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .	
23132960_s5	LPS decreased expression of SIRT6 in HUVECs .	
23132960_s6	Knockdown of SIRT6 increased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-1Î² , IL-6 , IL-8 ) , COX-prostaglandin system , ECM remodelling enzymes ( MMP-2 , MMP-9 and PAI-1 ) , the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 , and proangiogenic growth factors VEGF and FGF-2 ; cell migration ; cell adhesion to leukocytes .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis,tumor promoting inflammation
23132960_s7	Loss of SIRT6 increased the expression of NF-ÎºB , whereas overexpression of SIRT6 was associated with decreased NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity .	
23132960_s8	Taken together , these results demonstrate that the loss of SIRT6 in endothelial cells is associated with upregulation of genes involved in inflammation , vascular remodelling , and angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis,tumor promoting inflammation
23132960_s9	SIRT6 may be a potential pharmacological target for inflammatory vascular diseases .	inducing angiogenesis,tumor promoting inflammation
23135775_s0	New molecularly targeted therapies are needed for childhood ependymoma .	
23135775_s1	Angiogenesis and the PDGFR pathway could be potential therapeutic targets .	
23135775_s2	This study aimed to screen ependymomas for the expression and clinicopathological correlates of angiogenic factors and potential therapeutic targets including VEGFR , endoglin ( CD105 ) , CD34 , CD31 , c-Kit , PDGFR-Î± and PDGFR-Î² .	
23135775_s3	Immunohistochemistry for angiogenesis factors and PDGFR-Î± and Î² was performed in 24 archival tumor samples from children and adults treated for ependymoma at our institution .	
23135775_s4	CD31 density , CD105 density and pericyte coverage index ( PCI ) were calculated .	
23135775_s5	These findings were correlated with clinical outcome .	
23135775_s6	VEGFR2 was overexpressed in tumor cells in only one out of 24 cases , but was found overexpressed in the vessels in 6 cases .	inducing angiogenesis
23135775_s7	PDGFR-Î± and Î² were found to be over-expressed in the ependymoma tumor cells in seven out of 24 cases ( 29.2 % ) .	inducing angiogenesis
23135775_s8	CD31 density , CD105 density and PCI did not correlate with expression of PDGFRs .	inducing angiogenesis
23135775_s9	Overexpression of PDGFR-Î± and Î² in tumor cells and overexpression of PDGFR-Î± in tumor endothelium had prognostic significance and this was maintained in multivariate analysis for overexpression of PDGFR-Î± in tumor cells ( 2 year progression free survival was 16.7 Â± 15.2 for cases with overexpression of PDGFR-Î± in the tumor vs. 74.5 Â± 15.2 for those with low/no expression , hazard ratio = 5.78 , p = 0.04 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
23135775_s10	A number of angiogenic factors are expressed in ependymoma tumor cells and tumor endothelium .	inducing angiogenesis
23135775_s11	Preliminary evidence suggests that the expression of PDGFRs could have a prognostic significance in ependymoma .	inducing angiogenesis
23135775_s12	This data suggests that PDGFRs should be further evaluated as targets using novel PDGFR inhibitors .	inducing angiogenesis
23136839_s0	BACKGROUND Engineered zinc-finger nucleases ( ZFN ) represented an innovative method for the genome manipulation in vertebrates .	
23136839_s1	ZFN introduced targeted DNA double strand breaks ( DSB ) and initiated non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) after pronuclear or cytoplasmatic microinjection into zygotes .	
23136839_s2	Resulting frame shift mutations led to functional gene ablations in zebra fish , mice , pigs and also in laboratory rats .	
23136839_s3	Therefore , we targeted the rat Rag1 gene essential for the V(D)J recombination within the immunoglobulin production process and for the differentiation of mature B and T lymphocytes to generate an immunodeficient rat model in the LEW/Ztm strain .	
23136839_s4	RESULTS After microinjection of Rag1 specific ZFN mRNAs in 623 zygotes of inbred LEW/Ztm rats 59 offspring were born from which one carried a 4 bp deletion .	genomic instability and mutation
23136839_s5	This frame shift mutation led to a premature stop codon and a subsequently truncated Rag1 protein confirmed by the loss of the full-length protein in Western Blot analysis .	genomic instability and mutation
23136839_s6	Truncation of the Rag1 protein was characterized by the complete depletion of mature B cells .	
23136839_s7	The remaining T cell population contained mature CD4+/CD3+/TCRαβ+ as well as CD8+/CD3+/TCRαβ+ positive lymphocytes accompanied by a compensatory increase of natural killer cells in the peripheral blood .	
23136839_s8	Reduction of T cell development in Rag1 mutant rats was associated with a hypoplastic thymus that lacked follicular structures .	
23136839_s9	Histological evaluation also revealed the near-complete absence of lymphocytes in spleen and lymph nodes in the immunodeficient Rag1 mutant rat .	
23136839_s10	CONCLUSION The Rag1 mutant rat will serve as an important model for transplantation studies .	genomic instability and mutation
23136839_s11	Furthermore , it may be used as a model for reconstitution experiments related to the immune system , particularly with respect to different populations of human lymphocytes , natural killer cells and autoimmune phenomena .	avoiding immune destruction
23137536_s0	We previously demonstrated that downregulation of protein kinase CKII induces cellular senescence in human colon cancer HCT116 cells .	
23137536_s1	To investigate the role of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) in CKII downregulation during senescence , we employed computational algorithms .	
23137536_s2	Four miRNAs ( miR-186 , miR-216b , miR-337-3p , and miR-760 ) were predicted to be miRNAs against CKIIÎ± mRNA .	
23137536_s3	Mimics of all four miRNAs jointly downregulated CKIIÎ± expression in HCT116 cells .	
23137536_s4	Reporter analysis and RT-PCR have suggested that these four miRNAs may stimulate degradation of CKIIÎ± mRNA by targeting its 3 ' untranslated regions ( UTRs ) .	
23137536_s5	The four miRNA mimics increased senescent-associated Î²-galactosidase ( SA-Î²-gal ) staining , p53 and p21(Cip1/WAF1) expression , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production .	enabling replicative immortality,tumor promoting inflammation
23137536_s6	In contrast , concomitant knockdown of the four miRNAs by antisense inhibitors increased the CKIIÎ± protein level and suppressed CKII inhibition-mediated senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
23137536_s7	Finally , CKIIÎ± overexpression antagonized senescence induced by the four miRNA mimics .	enabling replicative immortality
23137536_s8	Therefore , the present results show that miR-186 , miR-216b , miR-337-3p , and miR-760 cooperatively promote cellular senescence through the p53-p21(Cip1/WAF1) pathway by CKII downregulation-mediated ROS production in HCT116 cells .	enabling replicative immortality,tumor promoting inflammation
23139719_s0	Aberrant expression of mucins is likely associated with cancer biology as alterations in the expression and/or glycosylation patterns of various mucins have been noted .	
23139719_s1	Expression of the mucin family in gastric cancers has been reported in numerous studies , but the results are conflicting .	
23139719_s2	Therefore , we investigated the potential use of mucin ( MUC)1 and 4 as prognostic markers in gastric cancer according to histological subtype .	
23139719_s3	Three-hundred and sixty-five gastric adenocarcinoma patients who underwent surgical resection were selected for this study .	
23139719_s4	Among the 365 gastric cancer samples tested here , 34% consisted of early gastric cancer and 66% were advanced .	
23139719_s5	In terms of location , 68.7% of the cohort had intestinal-type cancer and 30.7% had diffuse-type .	
23139719_s6	We constructed tissue microarrays with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of gastric cancer and these micro-arrays were evaluated for phenotypic expression of MUC1/4 using monoclonal antibodies .	
23139719_s7	Two-hundred and ninety-two patients ( 92.7% ) were positive for MUC1 and 216 ( 60.5% ) were positive for MUC4 .	activating invasion and metastasis
23139719_s8	MUC1 expression was not correlated with any other clinicopathological variables such as age , gender , depth of invasion , lymph node metastasis , Lauren classification or recurrence .	activating invasion and metastasis
23139719_s9	However , loss of MUC4 expression was significantly correlated with recurrence ( p=0.033 ) .	
23139719_s10	MUC4 expression was also significantly correlated with better disease-free survival ( p=0.049 ) and particularly in the intestinal-type ( p=0.018 ) .	
23139719_s11	Our present findings demonstrated that loss of MUC4 expression can be used as a prognostic marker in gastric cancer .	
23139719_s12	Loss of MUC4 expression is a prognostic indicator of increased recurrence and poor disease-free survival in patients with gastric cancer .	
23139858_s0	To investigate whether altered energy metabolism induces the Warburg effect and results in tumor malignancy , the respiratory enzyme citrate synthase ( CS ) was examined , silenced , and the effects analyzed .	
23139858_s1	In human cervical carcinoma cells , RNAi-mediated CS knockdown induced morphological changes characteristic of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23139858_s2	This switch accelerated cancer cell metastasis and proliferation in in vitro assays and in vivo tumor xenograft models .	activating invasion and metastasis
23139858_s3	Notably , CS knockdown cells exhibited severe defects in respiratory activity and marked decreases in ATP production , but great increases in glycolytic metabolism .	cellular energetics
23139858_s4	This malignant progression was due to activation of EMT-related regulators ; altered energy metabolism resulted from deregulation of the p53/TIGAR and SCO2 pathways .	
23139858_s5	This phenotypic change was completely reversed by p53 reactivation via treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 or co-knockdown of E3 ligase HDM2 and partially suppressed by ATP treatment .	
23139858_s6	This study directly links the Warburg effect to tumor malignancy via induction of the EMT phenotype .	activating invasion and metastasis,cellular energetics
23142370_s0	When the prostate cancer cells become unresponsive to androgen therapy , resistance to chemotherapy becomes imminent , resulting in high mortality .	
23142370_s1	To combat this situation , lycopodine , a pharmacologically important bioactive component derived from Lycopodium clavatum spores , was tested against hormone sensitive ( LnCaP ) and refractory ( PC3 ) prostate cancer cells in vitro .	
23142370_s2	This study aims to check if lycopodine has demonstrable anti-cancer effects and if it has , to find out the possible mechanism of its action .	
23142370_s3	The MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect .	
23142370_s4	Depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential , cell cycle , EGF receptor activity and apoptosis were recorded by FACS ; profiles of different anti- and pro-apoptotic genes and their products were studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR , indirect-ELISA , western blotting .	
23142370_s5	Drug-DNA interaction was determined by CD spectroscopy .	
23142370_s6	Administration of lycopodine down-regulated the expression of 5-lipoxygenase and the 5-oxo-ETE receptor ( OXE receptor1 ) and EGF receptor , and caused up-regulation of cytochrome c with depolarization of mitochondrial inner membrane potential , without palpable change in p53 activity , resulting in apoptosis , cell arrest at G0/G1 stage and ultimately reduced proliferation of cancer cells ; concomitantly , there was externalization of phosphotidyl serine residues .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23142370_s7	CD spectroscopic analysis revealed intercalating property of lycopodine with DNA molecule , implicating its ability to block cellular DNA synthesis .	
23142370_s8	The overall results suggest that lycopodine is a promising candidate suitable for therapeutic use as an anti-cancer drug .	
23142523_s0	BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Impairment of the immune system may contribute to the risk for having cancer as Toll-like receptors are important for innate immunity .	
23142523_s1	We examined the association between candidate disease-susceptibility polymorphisms in the single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) like TLR2 ( -196 to-174del ) , TLR3 ( C1377T ) , TLR4 ( Thr399Ile ) and TLR9 ( G2848A ) genes in patients with bladder cancer in a North Indian population .	
23142523_s2	METHODS : SNPs were comprised of TLR2 ( -196 to -174 Del ) , TLR3(C1377T) , TLR4 ( Thr399Ile ) and TLR9 ( G2848A ) genes .	
23142523_s3	Allelic and genotypic frequencies of these TLRs SNP from histopathologically confirmed patients of bladder cancer ( n=200 ) and unrelated healthy controls of similar ethnicity ( n=200 ) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) analysis .	
23142523_s4	RESULTS : In TLR2 I/D gene polymorphism , the combination of ID+DD showed a significant 3-fold increased risk ( p=0.001 ) .	
23142523_s5	TLR2 with heterozygous genotype ID showed a 3-fold risk and combination of heterozygous and variant genotype ( ID+DD ) also showed a 5-fold risk with tumor stage/grade of patients with bladder cancer .	
23142523_s6	The other genotypes of TLR3 , 4 and 9 did not exhibit any significant association with bladder cancer risk .	
23142523_s7	CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggested the involvement of TLR2 ( -196 to-174 del ) in bladder cancer susceptibility ; however , TLR3 , 4 and 9 genes were not associated with risk of bladder cancer , implicating that polymorphisms in these tested TLRs genes are not likely to be associated with increased risk for developing bladder cancer .	
23142523_s8	Functional studies in ethnically diverse populations may provide a more comprehensive involvement of innate immunity in identifying the disease-associated variants for the etiology of bladder cancer .	avoiding immune destruction
23143036_s0	DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) of simple base mismatches and small insertion-deletion loops in eukaryotes is initiated by the binding of the MutS homolog 2 ( MSH2)-MSH6 heterodimer to mismatched DNA .	
23143036_s1	Cadmium ( Cd ) is a genotoxic heavy metal that has been recognized as a human carcinogen .	
23143036_s2	Oxidant stress and inhibition of DNA repair have been proposed as major factors underlying Cd genotoxicity .	
23143036_s3	Our previous studies indicated the ability of Cd to disturb the gene expression of MSH6 in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) embryos .	
23143036_s4	This study was undertaken to explore if Cd-induced oxidative stress down-regulated MSH gene activities .	
23143036_s5	Following the exposure of zebrafish embryos at 1 h post fertilization ( hpf ) to sublethal concentrations of Cd at 3-5 μM for 4 or 9 h , a parallel down-regulation of MSH2 , MSH6 and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase ( Cu/Zn-SOD ) gene expression was detected by real-time RT-PCR and the expression levels were 40-50% of control after a 9-h exposure .	
23143036_s6	Cd exposure also induced oxidative stress , yet no inhibition of catalase gene activity was observed .	tumor promoting inflammation
23143036_s7	Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed a wide distribution of msh6 mRNA in the head regions of 10 hpf embryos and pretreatment of embryos with antioxidants butylhydroxytoluene ( BHT ) , d-mannitol or N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) at 1-10 μM restored Cd-suppressed msh6 expression .	
23143036_s8	QPCR confirmed the protective effects of antioxidants on Cd-suppressed msh2/msh6 mRNA production .	
23143036_s9	Down-regulated MSH gene activities reaching about 50% of control were also induced in embryos exposed to paraquat , a reactive oxygen species ( ROS)-generating herbicide , or hydrogen peroxide at 200 μM .	
23143036_s10	Hence , Cd at sublethal levels down-regulates msh2/msh6 expression primarily via ROS as signaling molecules .	tumor promoting inflammation
23143036_s11	The transcriptional activation of human msh6 is known to be fully dependent on the specificity factor 1 ( Sp1 ) .	
23143036_s12	Cd failed to inhibit the DNA binding activity of zebrafish Sp1 unless at lethal concentrations based on band shift assay , therefore excluding the involvement of Sp1 inactivation in Cd-induced MSH gene inhibition in zebrafish embryos .	
23143272_s0	Progression to malignancy requires that cells overcome senescence and switch to an immortal phenotype .	
23143272_s1	Thus , exploring the genetic and epigenetic changes that occur during senescence/immortalization may help elucidate crucial events that lead to cell transformation .	
23143272_s2	In the present study , we have globally profiled DNA methylation in relation to gene expression in primary , senescent and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts .	
23143272_s3	Using a high-resolution genome-wide mapping technique , followed by extensive locus-specific validation assays , we have identified 24 CpG islands that display significantly higher levels of CpG methylation in immortalized cell lines as compared to primary murine fibroblasts .	enabling replicative immortality
23143272_s4	Several of these hypermethylated CpG islands are associated with genes involved in the MEK-ERK pathway , one of the most frequently disrupted pathways in cancer .	
23143272_s5	Approximately half of the hypermethylated targets are developmental regulators , and bind to the repressive Polycomb group ( PcG ) proteins , often in the context of bivalent chromatin in mouse embryonic stem cells .	
23143272_s6	Because PcG-associated aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of several human malignancies , our methylation data suggest that epigenetic reprogramming of pluripotency genes may initiate cell immortalization .	enabling replicative immortality
23143272_s7	Consistent with methylome alterations , global gene expression analysis reveals that the vast majority of genes dysregulated during cell immortalization belongs to gene families that converge into the MEK-ERK pathway .	enabling replicative immortality
23143272_s8	Additionally , several dysregulated members of the MAP kinase network show concomitant hypermethylation of CpG islands .	
23143272_s9	Unlocking alternative epigenetic routes for cell immortalization will be paramount for understanding crucial events leading to cell transformation .	enabling replicative immortality
23143272_s10	Unlike genetic alterations , epigenetic changes are reversible events , and as such , can be amenable to pharmacological interventions , which makes them appealing targets for cancer therapy when genetic approaches prove inadequate .	
23144724_s0	The number of renal cancers has increased over the last ten years and patient survival in advanced stages remains very poor .	
23144724_s1	Therefore , new therapeutic approaches for renal cancer are essential .	
23144724_s2	Englerin A is a natural product with a very potent and selective cytotoxicity against renal cancer cells .	
23144724_s3	This makes it a promising drug candidate that may improve current treatment standards for patients with renal cancers in all stages .	
23144724_s4	However , little is known about englerin A's mode of action in targeting specifically renal cancer cells .	
23144724_s5	Our study is the first to investigate the biological mechanism of englerin A action in detail .	
23144724_s6	We report that englerin A is specific for renal tumor cells and does not affect normal kidney cells .	
23144724_s7	We find that englerin A treatment induces necrotic cell death in renal cancer cells but not in normal kidney cells .	resisting cell death
23144724_s8	We further show that autophagic and pyroptotic proteins are unaffected by the compound and that necrotic signaling in these cells coincided with production of reactive oxygen species and calcium influx into the cytoplasm .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23144724_s9	As the first study to analyze the biological effects of englerin A , our work provides an important basis for the evaluation and validation of the compound's use as an anti-tumor drug .	
23144724_s10	It also provides a context in which to identify the specific target or targets of englerin A in renal cancer cells .	
23145148_s0	Regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) ( PAR ) synthesis and turnover is critical to determining cell fate after genotoxic stress .	
23145148_s1	Hyperactivation of PAR synthesis by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( PARP-1 ) occurs when cells deficient in DNA repair are exposed to genotoxic agents ; however , the function of this hyperactivation has not been adequately explained .	
23145148_s2	Here , we examine PAR synthesis in mouse fibroblasts deficient in the base excision repair enzyme DNA polymerase β ( pol β ) .	
23145148_s3	The extent and duration of PARP-1 activation was measured after exposure to either the DNA alkylating agent , methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) , or to low energy laser-induced DNA damage .	
23145148_s4	There was strong DNA damage-induced hyperactivation of PARP-1 in pol β nullcells , but not in wild-type cells .	genomic instability and mutation
23145148_s5	In the case of MMS treatment , PAR synthesis did not lead to cell death in the pol β null cells , but instead resulted in increased PARylation of the nonhomologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) protein Ku70 and increased association of Ku70 with PARP-1 .	genomic instability and mutation
23145148_s6	Inhibition of the NHEJ factor DNA-PK , under conditions of MMS-induced PARP-1 hyperactivation , enhanced necrotic cell death .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
23145148_s7	These data suggest that PARP-1 hyperactivation is a protective mechanism triggering the classical-NHEJ DNA repair pathway when the primary alkylated base damage repair pathway is compromised .	genomic instability and mutation
23145312_s0	Thrombospondin-1 is a matricellular protein with potent antitumour activities , the levels of which determine the fate of many different tumours , including renal carcinomas .	
23145312_s1	However , the factors that regulate this protein remain unclear .	
23145312_s2	In renal carcinomas , hypoxic conditions enhance the expression of angiogenic factors that help adapt tumour cells to their hostile environment .	
23145312_s3	Therefore , we hypothesized that anti-angiogenic factors should correspondingly be dampened .	
23145312_s4	Indeed , we found that hypoxia decreased the thrombospondin-1 protein in several clear cell renal carcinoma cell lines ( ccRCC ) , although no transcriptional regulation was observed .	
23145312_s5	Furthermore , we proved that hypoxia stimulates multiple signals that independently contribute to diminish thrombospondin-1 in ccRCC , which include a decrease in the activity of oxygen-dependent prolylhydroxylases ( PHDs ) and activation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway .	
23145312_s6	In addition , thrombospondin-1 regulation in hypoxia proved to be important for ccRCC cell migration and invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
23147699_s0	DNA damage induced by benzene and its metabolites is thought of as an important mechanism underlying benzene genotoxicity in chronic benzene poisoning ( CBP ) .	
23147699_s1	Therefore , genetic variation in DNA repair genes may contribute to susceptibility to CBP in the exposed population .	
23147699_s2	Since benzene-induced DNA damages include DNA adducts , we hypothesized that the polymorphisms of ERCC1 ( Excision repair cross complementation group 1 ) and ERCC2/XPD ( Excision repair cross complementation group 2/xeroderma pigmentosum group D ) are associated with the risk of CBP .	
23147699_s3	A case-control study involving 102 benzene-poisoned patients and 204 none-benzene-poisoned controls occupationally exposed to benzene was carried out in the Northeast region of China .	
23147699_s4	The polymorphisms of codon 118 ( rs11615 ) and C8092A ( rs3212986 ) of ERCC1 , codon 751 ( rs13181 ) , 312 ( rs1799793 ) and 156 ( rs238406 ) of ERCC2/XPD were genotyped by TaqMan(®) Real-time PCR .	
23147699_s5	The results showed that individuals carrying the ERCC1 codon 118 TT genotype had an increased risk of CBP ( OR(adj)=3.390 ; 95%CI : 1.393-8.253 ; P=0.007 ) comparing with its CC genotype .	
23147699_s6	After stratified by smoking , gender and exposure duration we found that the increased risk of CBP associated with the ERCC1 codon 118 TT genotype confined to nonsmokers ( OR=3.214 ; 95% CI : 1.359-7.601 ; P=0.006 ) , female ( OR=3.049 ; 95% CI : 1.235-7.529 ; P=0.013 ) and exposure duration&gt ; 12 years ( OR=3.750 ; 95% CI : 1.041-13.513 ; P=0.035 ) .	
23147699_s7	Since ERCC1 and ERCC2/XPD are both located on chromosome 19q13.3 , haplotype analysis of all 5 SNPs was also conducted .	genomic instability and mutation
23147699_s8	However no correlations between the risks of CBP and other genotypes or haplotypes were found .	
23147699_s9	Therefore , our findings suggest an important role of ERCC1 codon 118 polymorphisms for a biomarker to CBP in the Chinese occupational population .	genomic instability and mutation
23149547_s0	The DNA repair protein Ku70 is a key player in chemoresistance to anticancer agents ( e.g. , etoposide ) or radioresistance .	
23149547_s1	The responses of different organs to radiation vary widely and likely depend on the cell population in the organs .	
23149547_s2	Previously , we established and characterized Ku70-deficient murine lung epithelial ( Ku70 -/- MLE ) cells and found that these cells are more sensitive than Ku70 +/- MLE cells ( control cells ) to X-irradiation , as determined by clonogenic survival assay ; however , the mechanism underlying this sensitivity remains unclear .	
23149547_s3	In this study , we examined the mechanism by which X-irradiation triggers the death of Ku70 -/- MLE cells .	
23149547_s4	Our results showed that Ku70 -/- MLE cells were more sensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis than control cells , although X-irradiation activated caspase-3 and caspase-7 , and cleaved PARP in both cell lines .	resisting cell death
23149547_s5	We also examined the expression level of phosphorylated H2AX ( γH2AX ) , which is a marker of DSB , and observed the phosphorylation of H2AX and the elimination of γH2AX in both cell lines after X-irradiation .	
23149547_s6	The elimination in Ku70 -/- MLE cells was slower than that in control cells , suggesting that DSB repair activity in the Ku70 -/- MLE cells is lower than that in control cells .	genomic instability and mutation
23149547_s7	These findings suggest that Ku70 might play a key role in the inhibition of apoptosis through the DSB repair pathway in lung epithelial cells .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
23149547_s8	Our findings also suggest that these cell lines might be useful for the study of Ku70 functions and the Ku70-dependent DSB repair pathway in lung epithelial cells .	genomic instability and mutation
23149912_s0	The main feedback loop driving circadian rhythm in mice is controlled , in part , by the genes encoding the cryptochromes Cry1 and Cry2 .	
23149912_s1	Targeted mutation of both Cry1 and Cry2 delay the early onset of tumor formation in p53-null mutant mice .	
23149912_s2	Furthermore , Ras-transformed p53- and Cry-null mouse skin fibroblasts are more sensitive than p53 mutants to apoptotic cell death initiated by agents that activate either the intrinsic or the extrinsic apoptosis pathways .	
23149912_s3	Here , we investigated the effect of Cry1 and Cry2 mutations on cell death by other genotoxic agents that generate alkylated bases , interstrand crosslinks , DNA-protein crosslinks , and double-strand breaks .	
23149912_s4	Both ultraviolet ( UV ) and the UV mimetic compound oxaliplatin and the radiomimetic compound doxorubicin promoted apoptosis by upregulating the tumor suppressor p73 .	resisting cell death
23149912_s5	However , only the UV and oxaliplatin-induced upregulation of p73 mediated by the transcription factor Egr1 , but not the doxorubicin-induced upregulation mediated by the transcription factor E2F1 , was enhanced by Cry1/Cry2 double mutation .	genomic instability and mutation
23149912_s6	Accordingly , Egr1 downregulation reduced oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis , whereas E2F1 downregulation reduced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23149912_s7	Our findings establish distinct roles for cryptochromes in intrinsic apoptosis induced by UV mimetic and radiomimetic agents .	resisting cell death
23149922_s0	More effective treatments for metastatic lung cancer remain a pressing clinical need .	
23149922_s1	In this study , we identified migration inducting gene-7 ( MIG-7 ) protein as critical for COX-2/prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2)- and Akt/GSK-3Î²-dependent tumor invasion/metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
23149922_s2	COX-2/PGE2 activated EP4 to enhance Akt and GSK-3Î² phosphorylation and Î²-catenin/T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor signaling leading to MIG-7 upregulation .	
23149922_s3	RNAi-mediated attenuation of MIG-7 blocked COX-2/PGE2- and Akt/GSK-3Î²-mediated migration/invasion effects .	activating invasion and metastasis
23149922_s4	Furthermore , MIG-7 protein inhibited protein phosphatase 2A to sustain Akt/GSK-3Î² phosphorylation and cancer-cell migration/invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
23149922_s5	Cancer cells overexpressing MIG-7 exhibited increased expression of ZEB-1 and Twist in parallel with epithelial-mesenchymal transition , metastasis and cancer lethality .	activating invasion and metastasis
23149922_s6	MIG-7 protein level positively correlated with advanced stages of human lung cancers .	
23149922_s7	MIG-7 thus offers a theranostic target for cancer metastases arising from aberrant activation of the cellular COX-2/PGE2 and Akt/GSK-3Î² signaling pathways .	activating invasion and metastasis
23151908_s0	Ophiopogonin B ( OP-B ) is a bioactive component of Radix Ophiopogon Japonicus , which is often used in Chinese traditional medicine to treat pulmonary disease .	
23151908_s1	However , whether or not OP-B has any potential antitumor activity has not been reported .	
23151908_s2	Here , we show that the non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines NCI-H157 and NCI-H460 treated with OP-B grow more slowly and accumulate vacuoles in their cytoplasm compared to untreated control cells .	
23151908_s3	Flow cytometric analysis showed that the cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23151908_s4	Nuclear morphology , Annexin-V/PI staining , and expression of cleaved caspase-3 all confirm that OP-B does not induce apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23151908_s5	Instead , based on results from both transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II ( LC3-II ) , we determined that OP-B treatment induced autophagy in both cell lines .	resisting cell death
23151908_s6	Next , we examined the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and found that OP-B inhibited phosphorylation of Akt(Ser473 , Thr308 ) in NCI-H157 cells and also inhibited several key components of the pathway in NCI-H460 cells , such as p-Akt(Ser473 , Thr308 ) , p-p70S6K ( Thr389 ) .	
23151908_s7	Additionally , insulin-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway provides evidence that activation of this pathway may correlate with induction of autophagy in H460 cells .	resisting cell death
23151908_s8	Therefore , OP-B is a prospective inhibitor of PI3K/Akt and may be used as an alternative compound to treat NSCLC .	
23152079_s0	It is well established that angiogenesis is the process of formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels .	
23152079_s1	It is a complex process , involving both pro- and anti-angiogenic factors , and plays a significant role in physiological and pathophysiological processes such as embryonic development , atherosclerosis , post-ischemic vascularization of the myocardium , tumor growth and metastasis , rheumatoid arthritis etc .	
23152079_s2	This is the first report of zinc oxide ( ZnO ) nanoflowers that show significant pro-angiogenic properties ( formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels ) , observed by in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis assays .	inducing angiogenesis
23152079_s3	The egg yolk angiogenesis assay using ZnO nanoflowers indicates the presence of matured blood vessels formation .	inducing angiogenesis
23152079_s4	Additionally , it helps to promote endothelial cell ( EA.hy926 cells ) migration in wound healing assays .	
23152079_s5	Formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , especially hydrogen peroxide ( H(2)O(2))-a redox signaling molecule , might be the plausible mechanism for nanoflower-based angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis,tumor promoting inflammation
23152079_s6	Angiogenesis by nanoflowers may provide the basis for the future development of new alternative therapeutic treatment strategies for cardiovascular and ischemic diseases , where angiogenesis plays a significant role .	
23152853_s0	Tumor development requires angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic therapies have been introduced in the treatment of cancer .	
23152853_s1	In this context , heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) emerge as interesting targets , owing to their function as co-receptors of major , pro-angiogenic factors .	
23152853_s2	Accordingly , previous studies have suggested anti-tumor effects of heparin , i.e. over-sulfated HS , and various heparin mimetics ; however , a significant drawback is their unspecific mechanism of action and potentially serious side-effects related to their anticoagulant properties .	
23152853_s3	Here , we have explored the use of human ScFv anti-HS antibodies ( Î±HS ) as a more rational approach to target HSPG function in endothelial cells ( ECs). Î±HS were initially selected for their recognition of HS epitopes localized preferentially to the vasculature of patient glioblastoma tumors , i.e. highly angiogenic brain tumors .	
23152853_s4	Unexpectedly , we found that these Î±HS exhibited potent pro-angiogenic effects in primary human ECs. Î±HS were shown to stimulate EC differentiation , which was associated with increased EC tube formation and proliferation .	
23152853_s5	Moreover , Î±HS supported EC survival under hypoxia and starvation , i.e. conditions typical of the tumor microenvironment .	
23152853_s6	Importantly , Î±HS-mediated proliferation was efficiently counter-acted by heparin and was absent in HSPG-deficient mutant cells , confirming HS-specific effects .	
23152853_s7	On a mechanistic level , binding of Î±HS to HSPGs of ECs as well as glioblastoma cells was found to trigger p38 MAPK-dependent signaling resulting in increased proliferation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23152853_s8	We conclude that several Î±HS that recognize HS epitopes abundant in the tumor vasculature may elicit a pro-angiogenic response , which has implications for the development of antibody-based targeting of HSPGs in cancer .	inducing angiogenesis
23155249_s0	Metastasis is a major cause of death of patients with malignant tumors .	
23155249_s1	Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are important for the migration and invasion of various types of cancer cell .	
23155249_s2	Propofol is a known anesthetic agent , widely used for short-term anesthesia and for longer-term sedation .	
23155249_s3	Propofol inhibits the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells , but there is no available information regarding propofol-inhibited migration and invasion of tumor cells in vitro .	
23155249_s4	In this study , we investigated the effects of propofol on the migration and invasion of human lung carcinoma A549 cells .	
23155249_s5	Wound healing assay and Boyden chamber assays indicated that propofol inhibited the migration and invasion of A549 cells in vitro .	activating invasion and metastasis
23155249_s6	Gelatin zymographic analysis showed the inhibitory effect of propofol on the activation of expression MMP-2 .	
23155249_s7	Western blot analysis also indicated that propofol suppressed the protein expiration of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 ( GRB2 ) , Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2 ( p-JNK1/2 ) , p-p38 , MMP-2 and MMP-9 in A549 cells .	
23155249_s8	Results from real-time PCR assay also showed that propofol inhibited the mRNA gene expression of MMP-2 , -7 and -9 , and enhanced that of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 ( TIMP1 ) and TIMP2 in A549 cells .	
23155249_s9	Taken together , these data show that propofol inhibits MMP-2 and -9 mRNA and protein expressions , resulting in suppression of lung cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro .	activating invasion and metastasis
23160380_s0	Adhesion to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is critical for epithelial tissue homeostasis and function .	
23160380_s1	ECM detachment induces metabolic stress and programmed cell death via anoikis .	
23160380_s2	ECM-detached mammary epithelial cells are able to rapidly activate autophagy allowing for survival and an opportunity for re-attachment .	
23160380_s3	However , the mechanisms controlling detachment-induced autophagy remain unclear .	
23160380_s4	Here we uncover that the kinase PERK rapidly promotes autophagy in ECM-detached cells by activating AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , resulting in downstream inhibition of mTORC1-p70(S6K) signaling .	resisting cell death
23160380_s5	LKB1 and TSC2 , but not TSC1 , are required for PERK-mediated inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycinin MCF10A cells and mouse embryo fibroblast cells .	
23160380_s6	Importantly , this pathway shows fast kinetics , is transcription-independent and is exclusively activated during ECM detachment , but not by canonical endoplasmic reticulum stressors .	
23160380_s7	Moreover , enforced PERK or AMPK activation upregulates autophagy and causes luminal filling during acinar morphogenesis by perpetuating a population of surviving autophagic luminal cells that resist anoikis .	resisting cell death
23160380_s8	Hence , we identify a novel pathway in which suspension-activated PERK promotes the activation of LKB1 , AMPK and TSC2 , leading to the rapid induction of detachment-induced autophagy .	resisting cell death
23160380_s9	We propose that increased autophagy , secondary to persistent PERK and LKB1-AMPK signaling , can robustly protect cells from anoikis and promote luminal filling during early carcinoma progression.Oncogene advance online publication , 19 November 2012 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.512 .	
23160493_s0	In response to genotoxic stress , a transient arrest in cell-cycle progression enforced by the DNA-damage checkpoint ( DDC ) signalling pathway positively contributes to genome maintenance .	
23160493_s1	Because hyperactivated DDC signalling can lead to a persistent and detrimental cell-cycle arrest , cells must tightly regulate the activity of the kinases involved in this pathway .	
23160493_s2	Despite their importance , the mechanisms for monitoring and modulating DDC signalling are not fully understood .	
23160493_s3	Here we show that the DNA-repair scaffolding proteins Slx4 and Rtt107 prevent the aberrant hyperactivation of DDC signalling by lesions that are generated during DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .	genomic instability and mutation
23160493_s4	On replication stress , cells lacking Slx4 or Rtt107 show hyperactivation of the downstream DDC kinase Rad53 , whereas activation of the upstream DDC kinase Mec1 remains normal .	
23160493_s5	An Slx4-Rtt107 complex counteracts the checkpoint adaptor Rad9 by physically interacting with Dpb11 and phosphorylated histone H2A , two positive regulators of Rad9-dependent Rad53 activation .	
23160493_s6	A decrease in DDC signalling results from hypomorphic mutations in RAD53 and H2A and rescues the hypersensitivity to replication stress of cells lacking Slx4 or Rtt107 .	
23160493_s7	We propose that the Slx4-Rtt107 complex modulates Rad53 activation by a competition-based mechanism that balances the engagement of Rad9 at replication-induced lesions .	
23160493_s8	Our findings show that DDC signalling is monitored and modulated through the direct action of DNA-repair factors .	genomic instability and mutation
23160694_s0	BACKGROUND Thymidine phosphorylase ( TYMP ) is an angiogenic factor that has potent chemotactic activity for endothelial cells and is involved in 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) metabolism .	
23160694_s1	In colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , previous studies evaluating the relationship between TYMP expression and clinicopathological features have yielded inconsistent results .	
23160694_s2	The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of TYMP , its association with other angiogenic factors , proliferation markers and , to our knowledge , for the first time its relationship with extracellular matrix components .	
23160694_s3	MATERIALS AND METHODS Formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded specimens from 97 patients with CRC were immunostained for TYMP , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , microvascular density ( CD34 ) , proliferation marker ( Ki-67 ) , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , p53 oncoprotein and extracellular matrix components ( collagen type IV , fibronectin , tenascin and laminin ) .	
23160694_s4	Survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method .	
23160694_s5	RESULTS Immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm ( cyt ) and nucleus ( n ) of the tumor cells , as well in the stroma ( st ) , endothelium and tumor-associated macrophages .	
23160694_s6	High TYMPcyt expression was observed in 7.2% of the cases , moderate in 22.7% and weak in 59.9% , while 10.3% were negative .	
23160694_s7	High TYMPst expression was observed in 58.8% of the cases .	
23160694_s8	TYMPcyt expression was correlated with the VEGF expression of tumor cells and VEGF expression of vessels ( p=0.014 and p=0.022 , respectively ) .	inducing angiogenesis
23160694_s9	TYMPst expression was correlated with VEGF expression and tenascin ( p=0.014 and p=0.011 , respectively ) .	inducing angiogenesis
23160694_s10	Patients with higher TYMPcyt expression had a more favorable overall survival ( p=0.041 ) in univariate analysis compared to patients without TYMP expression .	
23160694_s11	CONCLUSION These findings suggest that TYMP plays an important role in angiogenesis , extracellular matrix remodeling and in the prognosis of patients with CRC , but further studies are needed to clearly define its role in CRC .	inducing angiogenesis
23161172_s0	Olfactomedin 4 ( OLFM4 ) is highly expressed in gastrointestinal cancers and has an anti-apoptotic function .	
23161172_s1	The roles of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis and how it functions in these processes remain elusive .	
23161172_s2	We investigated the function of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis using B16F10 mouse melanoma cells as an experimental system .	
23161172_s3	Our results showed that OLFM4 had no positive effect on cell viability or cell cycle progression in B16F10 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23161172_s4	However , it significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of B16F10 cells , i.e. , intradermal primary tumor growth and lung metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
23161172_s5	OLFM4 also suppressed the migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro .	activating invasion and metastasis
23161172_s6	For further insight into the mechanisms underlying OLFM4-mediated suppression of tumor progression , we examined the effect of OLFM4 on the expression of integrin and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) , both of which are involved in tumor progression .	
23161172_s7	Overexpression of OLFM4 clearly reduced the expression levels of integrin Î±1 , integrin Î±4 , integrin Î±5 , integrin Î±6 , and MMP9 .	
23161172_s8	Moreover , forced expression of MMP9 attenuated the inhibitory activity of OLFM4 on migration and invasiveness .	activating invasion and metastasis
23161172_s9	Our findings provide the experimental evidence that OLFM4 may function as a tumor suppressor and an anti-metastatic gene during tumor progression .	activating invasion and metastasis
23161184_s0	Endothelial cells respond to hypoxic changes with resultant accumulation of several metabolites and switch over to angiogenic phenotype .	
23161184_s1	Although certain intermediates of glycolytic and oxidative metabolic pathways have been known to affect angiogenesis , the effect of citrate , which accumulates in certain tumors , on angiogenesis is not known .	
23161184_s2	Therefore , the effect of citrate on angiogenesis was studied using different model systems .	
23161184_s3	Increased vascularization in chorioallantoic membrane assay , increased endothelial sprouting in rat aortic rings , and increased expression of CD31 , E-selectin in endothelial cells suggested a possible proangiogenic effect of citrate .	inducing angiogenesis
23161184_s4	Upregulation of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor suggested that the effect of citrate involves modulation of expression of angiogenic growth factors .	inducing angiogenesis
23161184_s5	LY 294002 , an inhibitor of PI3K-Akt pathway , and wortmannin , an inhibitor of Akt pathway , reversed the effect of citrate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells .	
23161184_s6	Citrate induced significant upregulation and activation of Akt in endothelial cells .	
23161184_s7	Rapamycin , an inhibitor of mTOR , also reversed the effect of citrate in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and sprouting of aortic rings suggesting that the angiogenic effect of citrate involves activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23166757_s0	A key requirement for the development of cancer immunotherapy is the identification of tumour-associated antigens that are differentially or exclusively expressed on the tumour and recognized by the host immune system .	
23166757_s1	However , immune responses to such antigens are often muted or lacking due to the antigens being recognized as " self " , and further complicated by the tumour environment and regulation of immune cells within .	
23166757_s2	In an effort to circumvent the lack of immune responses to tumour antigens , we have devised a strategy to develop potential synthetic immunogens .	
23166757_s3	The strategy , termed mirror image phage display , is based on the concept of molecular mimicry as demonstrated by the idiotype/anti-idiotype paradigm in the immune system .	
23166757_s4	Here as ' proof of principle ' we have selected molecular mimics of the well-characterised tumour associated antigen , the human mucin1 protein ( MUC1 ) from two different peptide phage display libraries .	
23166757_s5	The putative mimics were compared in structure and function to that of the native antigen .	
23166757_s6	Our results demonstrate that several of the mimic peptides display T-cell stimulation activity in vitro when presented by matured dendritic cells .	
23166757_s7	The mimic peptides and the native MUC1 antigenic epitopes can cross-stimulate T-cells .	
23166757_s8	The data also indicate that sequence homology and/or chemical properties to the original epitope are not the sole determining factors for the observed immunostimulatory activity of the mimic peptides .	avoiding immune destruction
23167349_s0	Colon cancer is the third most common malignant neoplasm in the world and it remains an important cause of death , especially in western countries .	
23167349_s1	The toxic environmental pollutant , 1 , 2-dimethylhydrazine ( DMH ) , is also a colon-specific carcinogen .	
23167349_s2	Tannic acid ( TA ) is reported to be effective against various types of chemically induced toxicity and also carcinogenesis .	
23167349_s3	In the present study , we evaluated the chemopreventive efficacy of TA against DMH induced colon toxicity in a rat model .	
23167349_s4	Efficacy of TA against the colon toxicity was evaluated in terms of biochemical estimation of antioxidant enzyme activities , lipid peroxidation , histopathological changes and expression of early molecular markers of inflammation and tumor promotion .	
23167349_s5	DMH treatment induced oxidative stress enzymes ( p&lt;0.001 ) and an early inflammatory and tumor promotion response in the colons of Wistar rats .	tumor promoting inflammation
23167349_s6	TA treatment prevented deteriorative effects induced by DMH through a protective mechanism that involved reduction of oxidative stress as well as COX-2 , i-NOS , PCNA protein expression levels and TNF-Î±(p&lt;0.001) release .	tumor promoting inflammation
23167349_s7	It could be concluded from our results that TA markedly protects against chemically induced colon toxicity and acts plausibly by virtue of its antioxidant , anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activities .	tumor promoting inflammation
23168260_s0	Senescence is a cellular response preventing tumorigenesis .	
23168260_s1	The Ras oncogene is frequently activated or mutated in human cancers , but Ras activation is insufficient to transform primary cells .	
23168260_s2	Ina search for cooperating oncogenes , we identify the lysine demethylase JMJD2A/KDM4A .	
23168260_s3	We show that JMJD2A functions as a negative regulator of Ras-induced senescence and collaborates with oncogenic Ras to promote cellular transformation by negatively regulating the p53 pathway .	enabling replicative immortality
23168260_s4	We find CHD5 , a known tumor suppressor regulating p53 activity , as a target of JMJD2A .	
23168260_s5	The expression of JMJD2A inhibits Ras-mediated CHD5 induction leading to a reduced activity of the p53 pathway .	
23168260_s6	In addition , we show that JMJD2A is overexpressed inmouse and human lung cancers .	
23168260_s7	Depletion of JMJD2A in the human lung cancer cell line A549 bearing an activated K-Ras allele triggers senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
23168260_s8	We propose that JMJD2A is an oncogene that represents a target for Ras-expressing tumors .	
23168911_s0	The omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , elicit antiproliferative effects in cancer cell lines and in animal models .	
23168911_s1	Dietary DHA and EPA can be converted to their ethanolamine derivatives , docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine ( DHEA ) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine ( EPEA ) , respectively ; however , few studies are reported on their anticancer activities .	
23168911_s2	Here , we demonstrated that DHEA and EPEA were able to reduce cell viability in MCF-7 breast cancer cells whereas they did not elicit any effects in MCF-10A non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells .	
23168911_s3	Since DHA and EPA are ligands of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor ( PPAR ) Î³ , we sought to determine whether PPARÎ³ may also mediate DHEA and EPEA actions .	
23168911_s4	In MCF-7 cells , both compounds enhanced PPARÎ³ expression , stimulated a PPAR response element-dependent transcription as confirmed by the increased expression of its target gene PTEN , resulting in the inhibition of AKT-mTOR pathways .	
23168911_s5	Besides , DHEA and EPEA treatment induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 promoting its dissociation from beclin-1 which resulted in autophagy induction .	resisting cell death
23168911_s6	We also observed an increase of beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 expression along with an enhanced autophagosomes formation as revealed by mono-dansyl-cadaverine staining .	resisting cell death
23168911_s7	Finally , we demonstrated the involvement of PPARÎ³ in DHEA- and EPEA-induced autophagy by using siRNA technology and a selective inhibitor .	resisting cell death
23168911_s8	In summary , our data show that the two omega-3 ethanolamines exert antiproliferative effects by inducing autophagy in breast cancer cells highlighting their potential use as breast cancer preventive and/or therapeutic agents .	resisting cell death

23170250_s0	Necrotic cells are known to activate the innate immune system and trigger inflammation by releasing damage associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) .	
23170250_s1	However , how necrotic cells influence the induction of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell-mediated adaptive immune responses under sterile conditions , in the absence of pathogen associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) , remains poorly understood .	
23170250_s2	Here , we examined antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to primary sterile necrotic tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo .	
23170250_s3	We found that primary necrotic cells alone fail to generate CD8(+) T cell-dependent immune responses toward cell-associated antigens .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23170250_s4	We show that necrotic cells trigger CD8(+) T-cell immunity only in the presence of PAMPs or analogs , such as p(dI-dC) and/or unmethylated CpG DNA .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23170250_s5	The electroporation of tumor cells with these PAMPs prior to necrosis induction triggered antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses through a TLR9/MyD88-dependent pathway .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23170250_s6	In addition , we found that necrotic cells contain factors that can block the cross-priming of CD8(+) T cells even under non-sterile conditions and can serve as a possible mechanism of immunosuppression .	avoiding immune destruction,resisting cell death
23170250_s7	These results suggest that antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to primary necrotic tumor cells can be induced in the presence of PAMPs and thus have a substantial impact on the development of antitumor vaccination strategies .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23174717_s0	PURPOSE We did this retrospective study to explore the association between epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation and clinical features in postoperative recurrent female non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .	
23174717_s1	MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed clinical data on 86 female patients who had postoperative recurrent disease between December 1992 and July 2007 .	
23174717_s2	The start of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was treated as a censoring event .	
23174717_s3	Corresponding surgical specimens of primary tumors were used to test for EGFR mutations .	
23174717_s4	RESULTS Thirty patients presented with local recurrence and distant recurrence was identified in 56 .	
23174717_s5	Thirty-four of the 86 patients ( 40% ) harbored EGFR mutations .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
23174717_s6	Patients with distant recurrence were more likely to have EGFR mutations than patients with local recurrence ( 48% versus 23% ; P = 0.024 ) .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
23174717_s7	On multivariate analysis , distant recurrence was associated with a high frequency of EGFR mutations ( OR , 3.3 ; P = 0.028 ) .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
23174717_s8	Survival analysis showed poor survival of patients with mutated EGFR ( HR , 2.3 ; P = 0.017 ) or with non-adenocarcinoma histology ( HR , 3.3 ; P = 0.001 ) .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
23174717_s9	CONCLUSION The association between recurrence pattern and EGFR mutation status was suggested in recurrent female NSCLC patients .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
23174717_s10	In addition , our data indicate unfavorable disease process of EGFR mutated tumors .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
23174717_s11	Further studies need to be conducted to validate these findings .	
23178880_s0	Pyruvate kinase M2 ( PKM2 ) is upregulated in multiple cancer types and contributes to the Warburg effect by unclear mechanisms .	
23178880_s1	Here we demonstrate that EGFR-activated ERK2 binds directly to PKM2 Ile429/Leu431 through the ERK2 docking groove and phosphorylates PKM2 at Ser37 , but does not phosphorylate PKM1 .	
23178880_s2	Phosphorylated PKM2 Ser37 recruits PIN1 for cis-trans isomerization of PKM2 , which promotes PKM2 binding to importin α5 and translocating to the nucleus .	
23178880_s3	Nuclear PKM2 acts as a coactivator of β-catenin to induce c-Myc expression , resulting in the upregulation of GLUT1 , LDHA and , in a positive feedback loop , PTB-dependent PKM2 expression .	
23178880_s4	Replacement of wild-type PKM2 with a nuclear translocation-deficient mutant ( S37A ) blocks the EGFR-promoted Warburg effect and brain tumour development in mice .	cellular energetics,sustaining proliferative signaling
23178880_s5	In addition , levels of PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation correlate with EGFR and ERK1/2 activity in human glioblastoma specimens .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23178880_s6	Our findings highlight the importance of nuclear functions of PKM2 in the Warburg effect and tumorigenesis .	cellular energetics
23178942_s0	Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein consisting of a catalytic subunit , the telomerase reverse transcriptase , TERT , and an integrally associated RNA , TR , which contains a template for the synthesis of short repetitive G-rich DNA sequences at the ends of telomeres .	
23178942_s1	Telomerase can repetitively reverse transcribe its short RNA template , acting processively to add multiple telomeric repeats onto the same DNA substrate .	
23178942_s2	The contribution of enzyme processivity to telomere length regulation in human cells is not well characterized .	
23178942_s3	In cancer cells , under homeostatic telomere length-maintenance conditions , telomerase acts processively , while under nonequilibrium conditions , telomerase acts distributively on the shortest telomeres .	
23178942_s4	To investigate the role of increased telomerase processivity on telomere length regulation in human cells with limited lifespan that are dependent on human TERT ( hTERT ) for lifespan extension and immortalization , we mutated the leucine at position 866 in the reverse transcriptase C motif of hTERT to a tyrosine ( L866Y ) , which is the amino acid found at a similar position in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase .	
23178942_s5	We report that , similar to the previously reported ' gain of function ' Tetrahymena telomerase mutant ( L813Y ) , the human telomerase variant displays increased processivity. hTERT-L866Y , like wild-type hTERT can immortalize and extend the lifespan of limited lifespan cells .	enabling replicative immortality
23178942_s6	Moreover , hTERT-L866Y expressing cells display heterogenous telomere lengths , telomere elongation , multiple telomeric signals indicative of fragile sites and replicative stress , and an increase in short telomeres , which is accompanied by telomere trimming events .	
23178942_s7	Our results suggest that telomere length and homeostasis in human cells may be regulated by telomerase enzyme processivity .	
23180966_s0	BACKGROUND Phosphorylation of the H2AX histone is an early indicator of DNA double-strand breaks and of the resulting DNA damage response .	
23180966_s1	In the present study , we assessed the expression and prognostic significance of γ-H2AX in a cohort of 96 patients with operable non-small cell lung carcinoma .	
23180966_s2	METHODS Ninety-six paraffin-embedded specimens of non-small cell lung cancer patients were examined .	
23180966_s3	All patients underwent radical thoracic surgery of primary tumor ( lobectomy or pneumonectomy ) and regional lymph node dissection. γ-H2AX expression was assessed by standard immunohistochemistry .	
23180966_s4	Follow-up was available for all patients ; mean duration of follow-up was 27.50 ± 14.07 months ( range 0.2-57 months , median 24 months ) .	
23180966_s5	RESULTS Sixty-three patients ( 65.2% ) died during the follow-up period .	
23180966_s6	The mean survival time was 32.2 ± 1.9 months ( 95% confidence interval [ CI ] : 28.5-35.8 months ; median 30.0 months ) ; 1- , 2- and 3-year survival rates were 86.5% ± 3.5% , 57.3% ± 5.1% , and 37.1% ± 5.4% , respectively .	
23180966_s7	Low γ-H2AX expression was associated with a significantly better survival as compared with those having high γ-H2AX expression ( 35.3 months for low γ-H2AX expression versus 23.2 months for high γ-H2AX expression , P = 0.009 ; hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.95 , 95% CI : 1.15-3.30 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23180966_s8	Further investigation with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that high expression of γ-H2AX remained an independent prognostic factor of shorter overall survival ( HR 2.15 , 95% CI : 1.22-3.79 , P = 0.026 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23180966_s9	A combined p53/γ-H2AX analysis was performed , and we found that the p53 low/γ-H2AX low phenotype was associated with significantly better survival compared with all other phenotypes .	genomic instability and mutation
23180966_s10	CONCLUSION Our study is the first to demonstrate that expression of γ-H2AX detected by immunohistochemistry may represent an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer .	genomic instability and mutation
23180966_s11	Further studies are needed to confirm our results .	
23182879_s0	Endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress induces both autophagy and apoptosis yet the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying the regulation of these two cellular processes in cells undergoing ER stress remain less clear .	
23182879_s1	We report here that eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase ( EEF2K ) is a critical controller of the ER stress-induced autophagy and apoptosis in tumor cells .	resisting cell death
23182879_s2	DDIT4 , a stress-induced protein , was required for transducing the signal for activation of EEF2K under ER stress .	
23182879_s3	We further showed that phosphorylation of EEF2K at Ser398 was essential for induction of autophagy , while phosphorylation of the kinase at Ser366 and Ser78 exerted an inhibitory effect on autophagy .	resisting cell death
23182879_s4	Suppression of the ER stress-activated autophagy via silencing of EEF2K aggravated ER stress and promoted apoptotic cell death in tumor cells .	resisting cell death
23182879_s5	Moreover , inhibiting EEF2K by either RNAi or NH125 , a small molecule inhibitor of the enzyme , rendered tumor cells more sensitive to curcumin and velcade , two anticancer agents that possess ER stress-inducing action .	
23182879_s6	Our study indicated that the DDIT4-EEF2K pathway was essential for inducing autophagy and for determining the fate of tumor cells under ER stress , and suggested that inhibiting the EEF2K-mediated autophagy can deteriorate ER stress and lead to a greater apoptotic response , thereby potentiating the efficacy of the ER stress-inducing agents against cancer .	resisting cell death
23183175_s0	That a knock-in mouse harboring a dominant-negative thyroid hormone receptor ( TR)-Î² ( Thrb ) mutation develops metastatic thyroid cancer strongly suggests the involvement of TRÎ² in carcinogenesis .	
23183175_s1	Epigenetic silencing of the THRB gene is common in human cancers .	
23183175_s2	The aim of the present study was to determine how DNA methylation affected the expression of the THRB gene in differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) and how reexpression of the THRB gene attenuated the cancer phenotypes .	
23183175_s3	We used methylation-specific PCR to examine the expression and promoter methylation of the THRB gene in DTC tissues .	
23183175_s4	Thyroid cancer cells with hypermethylated THRB were treated with the demethylating agents 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5'-aza-CdR ) and zebularine to evaluate their impact on the cancer cell phenotypes .	
23183175_s5	THRB mRNA expression in DTC was 90% lower than in normal controls , and this decrease was associated with a higher tumor/lymph node staging .	
23183175_s6	The promoter methylation level of the THRB gene had a significant negative correlation with the expression level of the THRB gene .	
23183175_s7	Treatment of FTC-236 cells with 5'-aza-CdR or zebularine induced reexpression of the THRB gene and inhibited cell proliferation and migration .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23183175_s8	FTC-236 cells stably expressing TRÎ² exhibited lower cell proliferation and migration through inhibition of Î²-catenin signaling pathways compared with FTC-236 without TRÎ². 5'-Aza-CdR also led to suppression of tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model using FTC-236 cells consistent with the cell-based studies .	
23183175_s9	These finding indicate that TRÎ² is a tumor suppressor and could be tested as a potential therapeutic target .	
23184390_s0	This study aimed to analyze the role of endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC)-derived angiogenic factors and chemokines in the multistep process driving angiogenesis with a focus on the recently discovered macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF)/chemokine receptor axis .	
23184390_s1	Primary murine and murine embryonic EPCs ( eEPCs ) were analyzed for the expression of angiogenic/chemokines and components of the MIF/CXC chemokine receptor axis , focusing on the influence of hypoxic versus normoxic stimulation .	
23184390_s2	Hypoxia induced an upregulation of CXCR2 and CXCR4 but not CD74 on EPCs and triggered the secretion of CXCL12 , CXCL1 , MIF , and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) .	inducing angiogenesis
23184390_s3	These factors stimulated the transmigration activity and adhesive capacity of EPCs , with MIF and VEGF exhibiting the strongest effects under hypoxia .	inducing angiogenesis
23184390_s4	MIF- , VEGF- , CXCL12- , and CXCL1-stimulated EPCs enhanced tube formation , with MIF and VEGF exhibiting again the strongest effect following hypoxia .	inducing angiogenesis
23184390_s5	Tube formation following in vivo implantation utilizing angiogenic factor-loaded Matrigel plugs was only promoted by VEGF .	inducing angiogenesis
23184390_s6	Coloading of plugs with eEPCs led to enhanced tube formation only by CXCL12 , whereas MIF was the only factor which induced differentiation towards an endothelial and smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) phenotype , indicating an angiogenic and differentiation capacity in vivo .	inducing angiogenesis
23184390_s7	Surprisingly , CXCL12 , a chemoattractant for smooth muscle progenitor cells , inhibited SMC differentiation .	
23184390_s8	We have identified a role for EPC-derived proangiogenic MIF , VEGF and MIF receptors in EPC recruitment following hypoxia , EPC differentiation and subsequent tube and vessel formation , whereas CXCL12 , a mediator of early EPC recruitment , does not contribute to the remodeling process .	inducing angiogenesis
23184390_s9	By discerning the contributions of key angiogenic chemokines and EPCs , these findings offer valuable mechanistic insight into mouse models of angiogenesis and help to define the intricate interplay between EPC-derived angiogenic cargo factors , EPCs , and the angiogenic target tissue .	inducing angiogenesis
23185620_s0	There are contradictory observations about the different radiosensitivities of cancer stem cells and cancer non-stem cells .	
23185620_s1	To resolve these contradictory observations , we studied radiosensitivities by employing breast cancer stem cell ( CSC)-like MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB453 cells as well as their corresponding non-stem cells .	
23185620_s2	CSC-like cells proliferate without differentiating and have characteristics of tumor-initiating cells [ 1 ] .	
23185620_s3	These cells were exposed to γ-rays ( 1.25-8.75 Gy ) and survival curves were determined by colony formation .	
23185620_s4	A final slope , D(0) , of the survival curve for each cell line was determined to measure radiosensitivity .	
23185620_s5	The D(0) of CSC-like and non-stem MDA-MB-453 cells were 1.16 Gy and 1.55 Gy , respectively .	
23185620_s6	Similar results were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells ( 0.94 Gy vs. 1.56 Gy ) .	
23185620_s7	After determination of radiosensitivity , we investigated intrinsic cellular determinants which influence radiosensitivity including cell cycle distribution , free-radical scavengers and DNA repair .	
23185620_s8	We observed that even though cell cycle status and antioxidant content may contribute to differential radiosensitivity , differential DNA repair capacity may be a greater determinant of radiosensitivity .	genomic instability and mutation
23185620_s9	Unlike non-stem cells , CSC-like cells have little/no sublethal damage repair , a low intracellular level of ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) and delay of γ-H2AX foci removal ( DNA strand break repair ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23185620_s10	These results suggest that low DNA repair capacity is responsible for the high radiosensitivity of these CSC-like cells .	genomic instability and mutation
23185784_s0	We have already shown that IL-10 plays an important role in immunosuppression and metastatic dissemination in the rat B-cell lymphoma L-TACB model .	
23185784_s1	It was suggested that the up-regulation of IL-10 production and IL-10 receptor ( IL-10R ) expression would be part of the transition from primary tumor to metastatic phenotype and that IL-10 , besides its immunosuppressive activity , may act as a growth factor for metastatic L-TACB cells .	
23185784_s2	The treatment of L-TACB-bearing rats with a single low-dose cyclophosphamide decreased IL-10 production , reverted immunosuppression and induced the immunologic rejection of tumor metastasis without any effect on primary tumor growth .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
23185784_s3	Our current aim was to investigate the effects of cyclophosphamide on the expression of IL-10 and IL-10R on primary and metastatic L-TACB cells .	
23185784_s4	Considering that cyclophosphamide is a prodrug , we used mafosfamide , a compound that yields in vitro the same active metabolites as cyclophosphamide does in vivo .	
23185784_s5	Mafosfamide induced down-regulation of IL-10 production and IL-10R expression on metastatic cells and , concomitantly , inhibited metastatic cell proliferation .	activating invasion and metastasis
23185784_s6	We suggest that mafosfamide would inhibit the regulatory loop mediated by the IL-10/IL-10R system and , as a consequence , metastatic cell proliferation .	activating invasion and metastasis
23185784_s7	These results may have a considerable impact on the design of new therapies for metastatic lymphomas .	activating invasion and metastasis
23187803_s0	When the cell cycle is arrested , even though growth-promoting pathways such as mTOR are still active , then cells senesce .	
23187803_s1	For example , induction of either p21 or p16 arrests the cell cycle without inhibiting mTOR , which , in turn , converts p21/p16-induced arrest into senescence ( geroconversion ) .	
23187803_s2	Here we show that geroconversion is accompanied by dramatic accumulation of cyclin D1 followed by cyclin E and replicative stress .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23187803_s3	When p21 was switched off , senescent cells ( despite their loss of proliferative potential ) progressed through S phase , and levels of cyclins D1 and E dropped .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
23187803_s4	Most cells entered mitosis and then died , either during mitotic arrest or after mitotic slippage , or underwent endoreduplication .	
23187803_s5	Next , we investigated whether inhibition of mTOR would prevent accumulation of cyclins and loss of mitotic competence in p21-arrested cells .	
23187803_s6	Both nutlin-3 , which inhibits mTOR in these cells , and rapamycin suppressed geroconversion during p21-induced arrest , decelerated accumulation of cyclins D1 and E and decreased replicative stress .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23187803_s7	When p21 was switched off , cells successfully progressed through both S phase and mitosis .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23187803_s8	Also , senescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) overexpressed cyclin D1 .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
23187803_s9	After release from cell cycle arrest , senescent MEFs entered S phase but could not undergo mitosis and did not proliferate .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
23187803_s10	We conclude that cellular senescence is characterized by futile hyper-mitogenic drive associated with mTOR-dependent mitotic incompetence .	enabling replicative immortality
23196876_s0	Gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) is a prototype of mutant KIT oncogene-driven tumor .	
23196876_s1	Prolonged tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) treatment may result in a resistant phenotype through acquired secondary KIT mutation .	
23196876_s2	Heat shock protein 90 ( HSP90AA1 ) is a chaperone protein responsible for protein maturation and stability , and KIT is a known client protein of HSP90AA1 .	
23196876_s3	Inhibition of HSP90AA1 has been shown to destabilize KIT protein by enhancing its degradation via the proteasome-dependent pathway .	
23196876_s4	In this study , we demonstrated that NVP-AUY922 ( AUY922 ) , a new class of HSP90AA1 inhibitor , is effective in inhibiting the growth of GIST cells expressing mutant KIT protein , the imatinib-sensitive GIST882 and imatinib-resistant GIST48 cells .	
23196876_s5	The growth inhibition was accompanied with a sustained reduction of both total and phosphorylated KIT proteins and the induction of apoptosis in both cell lines .	resisting cell death
23196876_s6	Surprisingly , AUY922-induced KIT reduction could be partially reversed by pharmacological inhibition of either autophagy or proteasome degradation pathway .	resisting cell death
23196876_s7	The blockade of autophagy alone led to the accumulation of the KIT protein , highlighting the role of autophagy in endogenous KIT turnover .	resisting cell death
23196876_s8	The involvement of autophagy in endogenous and AUY922-induced KIT protein turnover was further confirmed by the colocalization of KIT with MAP1LC3B- , acridine orange- or SQSTM1-labeled autophagosome , and by the accumulation of KIT in GIST cells by silencing either BECN1 or ATG5 to disrupt autophagosome activity .	resisting cell death
23196876_s9	Therefore , the results not only highlight the potential application of AUY922 for the treatment of KIT-expressing GISTs , but also provide the first evidence for the involvement of autophagy in endogenous and HSP90AA1 inhibitor-induced KIT degradation .	resisting cell death
23197380_s0	Prohibiting angiogenesis is an important therapeutic approach for fighting cancer and other angiogenic related diseases .	
23197380_s1	Research focused on proteins that regulate abnormal angiogenesis has attracted intense interest in both academia and industry .	
23197380_s2	Such proteins are able to target several angiogenic factors concurrently , thereby increasing the possibility of therapeutic success .	
23197380_s3	Aquaporin-1 ( AQP1 ) is a water channel membrane protein that promotes tumour angiogenesis by allowing faster endothelial cell migration .	
23197380_s4	In this study we test the hypothesis that AQP1 inhibition impairs tumour growth in a mouse model of melanoma .	
23197380_s5	After validating the inhibitor efficacy of two different AQP1 specific siRNAs in cell cultures , RNA interference experiments were performed by intratumoural injections of AQP1 siRNAs in mice .	
23197380_s6	After 6 days of treatment , AQP1 siRNA treated tumours showed a 75 % reduction in volume when compared to controls .	
23197380_s7	AQP1 protein level , in AQP1 knockdown tumours , was around 75 % that of the controls and was associated with a significant 40 % reduced expression of the endothelial marker , Factor VIII .	
23197380_s8	Immunofluorescence analysis of AQP1 siRNA treated tumours showed a significantly lower microvessel density .	inducing angiogenesis
23197380_s9	Time course experiments demonstrated that repeated injections of AQP1 siRNA over time are effective in sustaining the inhibition of tumour growth .	
23197380_s10	Finally , we have confirmed the role of AQP1 in sustaining an active endothelium during angiogenesis and we have shown that AQP1 reduction causes an increase in VEGF levels .	inducing angiogenesis
23197380_s11	In conclusion , this study validates AQP1 as a pro-angiogenic protein , relevant for the therapy of cancer and other angiogenic-related diseases such as psoriasis , endometriosis , arthritis and atherosclerosis .	inducing angiogenesis
23198967_s0	Bisphenol A is a monomer used in the production of polycarbonate plastics , epoxy resins , and flame retardants .	
23198967_s1	It is an endocrine disruptor with a variety of other effects , including genotoxicity .	
23198967_s2	Oxidative metabolism of bisphenol A yields electophilic bisphenol A-3,4-quinone ( BPAQ ) , which may cause genotoxicity .	
23198967_s3	To determine the genotoxic potential of bisphenol A , the mechanism of the reaction between the BPAQ and deoxyadenosine ( dA ) was studied in detail .	
23198967_s4	The most probable reaction pathway was determined using quantum chemical methods .	
23198967_s5	Our results demonstrate that the rate limiting step is Michael addition between BPAQ and dA , the main product being the unstable N7-modified adduct that rapidly undergoes depurination .	genomic instability and mutation
23198967_s6	In addition , our calculations provide strong evidence for protonation of the adducts prior to depurination , which indicates pH dependence of the reaction .	
23198967_s7	The calculated activation barrier for Michael addition is 28.7 kcal/mol , indicating that the reaction with dA is very slow .	
23198967_s8	Comparison with the activation energy of 23.1 kcal/mol for the corresponding deoxyguanosine reaction indicates that most of the DNA damage by BPAQ will occur at the guanine site .	genomic instability and mutation
23198967_s9	The detoxification reactions with glutathione compete with reactions between BPAQ and DNA .	
23198967_s10	The calculated free energy of activation for the reaction with glutathione is significantly lower than that for the corresponding reaction with dA .	
23198967_s11	This indicates that BPAQ will preferably react with glutathione and will only react with DNA when the level of glutathione in the cell is low .	
23199656_s0	BACKGROUND Cellular and clinical sensitivity to ionizing radiation ( IR ) is determined by DNA double-strand breaks ( DSB ) repair .	
23199656_s1	Here , we investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the extreme response of a head and neck tumor case ( SKX ) to standard radiotherapy .	
23199656_s2	METHODS Immunofluorescence ( IF ) was used for the assessment of DSB repair , Western blot and real-time PCR for protein and mRNA expression , respectively .	
23199656_s3	RESULTS SKX cells exhibited a pronounced radiosensitivity associated with numerous residual γ-H2AX foci after IR .	genomic instability and mutation
23199656_s4	This was not associated with lacking canonical repair proteins .	genomic instability and mutation
23199656_s5	SKX cells did not express any ATM protein .	
23199656_s6	Accordingly , immunoblotting revealed no ATM kinase activity toward substrates such as p-SMC1 , p-CHK2 and p-KAP1 .	
23199656_s7	Sequencing of all 66 exons of ATM showed no mutation .	genomic instability and mutation
23199656_s8	ATM mRNA level was moderately reduced , which could be reverted by 5'-Aza-C treatment but without restoring protein levels .	
23199656_s9	Importantly , we demonstrated a post-transcriptional regulation in SKX cells via 6-fold enhanced levels of miR-421 , which targets the 3'-UTR of ATM mRNA .	
23199656_s10	Transfection of SKX cells with either anti-miR-421 inhibitor or a microRNA-insensitive ATM vector recovered ATM expression and abrogated the hyper-radiosensitivity .	
23199656_s11	CONCLUSION This is the first report describing microRNA-mediated down-regulation of ATM leading to clinically manifest tumor radiosensitivity .	
23200933_s0	Autophagy , or autophagocytosis , is a selective intracellular degradative process involving the cell's own lysosomal apparatus .	
23200933_s1	An essential component in cell development , homeostasis , repair and resistance to stress , autophagy may result in either cell death or survival .	
23200933_s2	The targeted region of the cell is sequestered within a membrane structure , the autophagosome , for regulation of the catabolic process .	
23200933_s3	A key factor in both autophagosome formation and autophagosome maturation is a protein encoded by the ultraviolet irradiation resistance-associated gene ( UVRAG ) .	
23200933_s4	Conversely , the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase B ( PKB , also known as Akt ) , which regulates survival in various cancers , inhibits autophagy through mTOR activation .	
23200933_s5	We found that Akt1 may also directly inhibit autophagy by down-regulating UVRAG both in a 293T transient transfection system and breast cancer cells stably expressing Akt1 .	
23200933_s6	The UVRAG with mutations at putative Akt1-phosphorylation sites were still inhibited by Akt1 , and dominant-negative Akt1 also inhibited UVRAG expression , suggesting that Akt1 down-regulates UVRAG by a kinase activity-independent mechanism .	
23200933_s7	We showed that Akt1 overexpression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells down-regulated UVRAG transcription .	
23200933_s8	Cells over-expressing Akt1 were more resistant than control cells to ultraviolet light-induced autophagy and exhibited the associated reduction in cell viability .	resisting cell death
23200933_s9	Levels of the autophagosome indicator protein LC3B-II and mRFP-GFP-LC3 were reduced in cells that over-expressing Akt1 .	
23200933_s10	Inhibiting Akt1 by siRNA or reintroducing UVRAG gene rescued the level of LC3B-II in UV-irradiation .	
23200933_s11	Altogether , these data suggest that Akt1 may inhibit autophagy by decreasing UVRAG expression , which also sensitizes cancer cells to UV irradiation .	resisting cell death
23203444_s0	Von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the production of angiogenic factors .	
23203444_s1	Mutations in the VHL gene cause VHL syndrome , which is characterized by highly vascularized tumors .	
23203444_s2	Here we report a c.464T&gt;A mutation of the VHL gene in three patients with hemangioblastoma from a Chinese family .	genomic instability and mutation
23203444_s3	This mutation was not reported previously and was absent in the unaffected family members .	
23203444_s4	The mutation is predicted to cause Val to Glu substitution at VHL protein residue 155 in a conserved region .	
23203444_s5	Previous biochemical studies demonstrated that residue Val-155 was critical for VHL protein binding to chaperonin TRiC/CCT , an essential step for proper VHL protein folding .	
23203444_s6	Our finding of naturally occurring VHL V155E mutation in patients with VHL syndrome supports the functional importance of Val-155 residue in VHL protein and illustrates the diversity of VHL gene defects underlying VHL syndrome .	genomic instability and mutation
23205094_s0	The Î²2-adrenergic receptor ( Î²2AR ) mediates the effects of chronic stress in several neoplasms , however , Î²2AR signaling is impaired by hypoxia in various tissues .	
23205094_s1	While hypoxia is a common feature significant in the progression of solid tumors , little is known about the effect of hypoxia on Î²2AR signaling in the tumor microenvironment .	
23205094_s2	Previously , it has been reported that the systemic administration of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) increased the engraftment and metastatic colonization of rat osteosarcoma ( OS ) cells .	
23205094_s3	In the current study , the effect of MSCs on the hypoxia-induced desensitization of the Î²2AR in OS cells was investigated .	
23205094_s4	Epinephrine , norepinephrine and isoproterenol increased the cellular proliferation of the rat OS cell line COS1NR and rat MSCs in a dose-dependent and Î²2AR antagonist-sensitive manner .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23205094_s5	While isoproterenol had significant proliferative effects on MSCs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions , COS1NR cells did not respond under hypoxic conditions .	
23205094_s6	A sensitivity assay for the Î²2AR revealed that hypoxia impaired the sensitivity of COS1NR cells , whereas hypoxia did not affect MSCs .	
23205094_s7	An immunoassay revealed no significant change in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± ( HIF1Î± ) in COS1NR cells , whilst an immunoassay demonstrated a 15% increase in MSCs following isoproterenol stimulation .	
23205094_s8	In COS1NR cells co-cultured with MSCs under hypoxic conditions , isoproterenol caused a significant increase in proliferation and this effect was inhibited by an anti-interleukin ( IL)-6 antibody .	
23205094_s9	A tumor formation assay in syngeneic rats revealed that the systemic administration of MSCs enhances the growth of OS and the effect of MSCs was inhibited by IL-6 neutralization .	
23205094_s10	In conclusion , MSCs are resistant to the hypoxia-induced desensitization to Î²2AR .	
23205094_s11	Hypoxia caused a siginificant desensitization of the Î²2AR in COS1NR cells alone , whereas MSCs may support tumor progression through cellular interactions .	
23209436_s0	Genomic instability drives tumorigenesis , but how it is initiated in sporadic neoplasias is unknown .	
23209436_s1	In early preneoplasias , alterations at chromosome fragile sites arise due to DNA replication stress .	
23209436_s2	A frequent , perhaps earliest , genetic alteration in preneoplasias is deletion within the fragile FRA3B/FHIT locus , leading to loss of Fhit protein expression .	
23209436_s3	Because common chromosome fragile sites are exquisitely sensitive to replication stress , it has been proposed that their clonal alterations in cancer cells are due to stress sensitivity rather than to a selective advantage imparted by loss of expression of fragile gene products .	
23209436_s4	Here , we show in normal , transformed , and cancer-derived cell lines that Fhit-depletion causes replication stress-induced DNA double-strand breaks .	genomic instability and mutation
23209436_s5	Using DNA combing , we observed a defect in replication fork progression in Fhit-deficient cells that stemmed primarily from fork stalling and collapse .	
23209436_s6	The likely mechanism for the role of Fhit in replication fork progression is through regulation of Thymidine kinase 1 expression and thymidine triphosphate pool levels ; notably , restoration of nucleotide balance rescued DNA replication defects and suppressed DNA breakage in Fhit-deficient cells .	
23209436_s7	Depletion of Fhit did not activate the DNA damage response nor cause cell cycle arrest , allowing continued cell proliferation and ongoing chromosomal instability .	genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
23209436_s8	This finding was in accord with in vivo studies , as Fhit knockout mouse tissue showed no evidence of cell cycle arrest or senescence yet exhibited numerous somatic DNA copy number aberrations at replication stress-sensitive loci .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
23209436_s9	Furthermore , cells established from Fhit knockout tissue showed rapid immortalization and selection of DNA deletions and amplifications , including amplification of the Mdm2 gene , suggesting that Fhit loss-induced genome instability facilitates transformation .	
23209436_s10	We propose that loss of Fhit expression in precancerous lesions is the first step in the initiation of genomic instability , linking alterations at common fragile sites to the origin of genome instability .	genomic instability and mutation
23212913_s0	MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are considered to be regulators of various biological processes in cancers , including the epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which is a key factor in cancer metastasis .	
23212913_s1	In this study , we aimed to clarify the potential roles of miR-490-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells .	
23212913_s2	Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR , we discovered that miR-490-3p was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cells compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues and normal cells .	
23212913_s3	We also found that overexpression of miR-490-3p led to an increase in cell proliferation , migration , and invasion abilities and that it contributed to EMT .	activating invasion and metastasis
23212913_s4	The inhibition of miR-490-3p had the opposite effect on the cells .	
23212913_s5	We identified ERGIC3 ( endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment protein 3 ) as a direct target gene for miR-490-3p .	
23212913_s6	Unlike most miRNA-mRNA interactions , miR-490-3p increased ERGIC3 mRNA and protein levels as well as the intensity of expression of the EGFP reporter gene controlled by the 3'-UTR of ERGIC3 mRNA .	
23212913_s7	The up-regulation by miR-490-3p also required the participation of Ago2 .	
23212913_s8	The inhibition of miR-490-3p reduced the expression of ERGIC3 .	
23212913_s9	Overexpression of ERGIC3 led to the same effect on HCC cells as miR-490-3p overexpression , including EMT .	
23212913_s10	Importantly , silencing ERGIC3 reversed the cellular responses mediated by miR-490-3p overexpression .	
23212913_s11	In conclusion , our study indicated for the first time that miR-490-3p functioned like an oncogenic miRNA in HCC cells and that the inhibition of miR-490-3p might provide an potential treatment approach for HCC patients .	
23213352_s0	Group VIB Phospholipase A(2) ( iPLA(2)Î³ ) is distributed in membranous organelles in which Î²-oxidation occurs , that is , mitochondria and peroxisomes , and is expressed by insulin-secreting pancreatic islet Î²-cells and INS-1 insulinoma cells , which can be injured by inflammatory cytokines , for example , IL-1Î² and IFN-Î³ , and by oxidants , for example , streptozotocin ( STZ ) or t-butyl-hydroperoxide ( TBHP ) , via processes pertinent to mechanisms of Î²-cell loss in types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus .	
23213352_s1	We find that incubating INS-1 cells with IL-1Î² and IFN-Î³ , with STZ , or with TBHP causes increased expression of iPLA(2)Î³ mRNA and protein .	
23213352_s2	We prepared INS-1 knockdown ( KD ) cell lines with reduced iPLA(2)Î³ expression , and they proliferate more slowly than control INS-1 cells and undergo increased membrane peroxidation in response to cytokines or oxidants .	
23213352_s3	Accumulation of oxidized phospholipid molecular species in STZ-treated INS-1 cells was demonstrated by LC/MS/MS scanning , and the levels in iPLA(2)Î³-KD cells exceeded those in control cells. iPLA(2)Î³-KD INS-1 cells also exhibited higher levels of apoptosis than control cells when incubated with STZ or with IL-1Î² and IFN-Î³ .	
23213352_s4	These findings suggest that iPLA(2)Î³ promotes Î²-cell proliferation and that its expression is increased during inflammation or oxidative stress as a mechanism to mitigate membrane injury that may enhance Î²-cell survival .	tumor promoting inflammation
23219753_s0	The functions of Rap-1A in oral carcinogenesis are largely unexplored .	
23219753_s1	In this study , we examined the expression of Rap-1A at different malignant stages of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma ( OCSCC ) .	
23219753_s2	Semiquantitative RT-PCR , quantitative RT-PCR , and Western blotting were used to evaluate Rap-1A mRNA and protein expressions , respectively , in paired OCSCC patient specimens .	
23219753_s3	To determine the possible correlation between Rap-1A expression and various clinical characteristics , 256 samples from patients with OCSCC were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining .	
23219753_s4	Strong Rap-1A expression was a significant prognostic marker and predictor of aggressive OCSCC .	
23219753_s5	The overall and disease-specific 5-year survival rates were significantly correlated with strong expression of Rap-1A ( P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
23219753_s6	Functionally , overexpressed Rap-1A could promote oral cancer cell migration and invasion by Transwell chambers and wound healing assay .	activating invasion and metastasis
23219753_s7	Conversely , the suppression of Rap-1A expression using Rap-1A-mediated siRNA was sufficient to decrease cell motility .	
23219753_s8	Furthermore , our data also illustrated that Aurora-A could not only induce mRNA and protein expressions of Rap-1A for enhancing cancer cell motility but also co-localize and form a complex with Rap-1A in the oral cancer cell line .	
23219753_s9	Finally , immunohistochemical staining , indirect immunofluorescence , and Western blotting analysis of human aggressive OCSCC specimens revealed a significantly positive correlation between Rap-1A and Aurora-A expression .	
23219753_s10	Taken together , our results suggest that the Aurora-A/Rap-1A pathway is associated with survival , tumor progression , and metastasis of OCSCC patients .	activating invasion and metastasis
23220513_s0	Methyleugenol ( MEG ) , a constituent of plants used in the human diet , is hepatocarcinogenic in rodents .	
23220513_s1	In an experiment to elucidate its mode of action in rat liver , male F344 rats were administered MEG intragastrically at 3 doses per week for up to 16 weeks in an initiation phase , after which half the rats were fed 500 ppm phenobarbital ( PB ) in the diet to promote liver neoplasia and the other half were maintained on control diet for 24 weeks .	
23220513_s2	At 8 and 16 week interim terminations , ( 32)P-nucleotide postlabeling assay revealed 3 adducts in livers of all MEG groups .	genomic instability and mutation
23220513_s3	The hepatocellular replicating fractions , measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry , were doubled or more in all MEG groups .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23220513_s4	Hepatocellular altered foci , detected by glutathione S-transferase-placental type ( π ) immunohistochemistry , were present beginning with the high dose group at 8 weeks and extending to all MEG groups at 16 weeks .	
23220513_s5	At the end of maintenance/promotion phase , the incidences , multiplicity and size of foci was similar between control and low dose groups , while those of mid and high dose groups were increased .	
23220513_s6	Hepatocellular adenomas occurred in the mid and high dose groups , attaining higher multiplicity and size with PB .	
23220513_s7	Thus , MEG had rapid initiating activity , reflecting the formation of DNA adducts and possibly cell proliferation .	genomic instability and mutation
23221036_s0	The potential of cytologically reconstructed barley line D-2946 to cope with the major lesions that hamper genome integrity , namely DNA single- and double-strand breaks was investigated .	
23221036_s1	Strand breaks induced by γ-rays and Li ions were assessed by neutral and alkaline comet assay .	
23221036_s2	Repair capacity after bleomycin treatment was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis under neutral and alkaline conditions .	
23221036_s3	Frequencies of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations were also determined .	
23221036_s4	Results indicate that radiation-mediated constitutive rearrangement of the chromosome complement has led to a substantial modulation of the sensitivity of barley genome towards DNA strand breaks , produced by ionising radiation , Li ion implantation and bleomycin in an agent-specific manner , as well as of the clastogenic response to γ-rays .	genomic instability and mutation
23221036_s5	Based on these findings , reconstructed barley karyotype D-2946 can be considered a candidate radio-sensitive line with reduced ability to maintain genome integrity with respect to both DNA and chromosomal damage .	genomic instability and mutation
23221383_s0	Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can promote chemoresistance and metastatic spread in aggressive tumors .	
23221383_s1	Consequently , the type and quality of immune responses present in the neoplastic stroma are highly predictive of patient outcome in several cancer types .	
23221383_s2	In addition to host immune responses , intrinsic tumor cell activities that mimic stem cell properties have been linked to chemoresistance , metastatic dissemination and the induction of immune suppression .	
23221383_s3	Cancer stem cells are far from a static cell population ; rather , their presence appears to be controlled by highly dynamic processes that are dependent on cues from the tumor stroma .	
23221383_s4	However , the impact immune responses have on tumor stem cell differentiation or expansion is not well understood .	
23221383_s5	In this study , we demonstrate that targeting tumor-infiltrating macrophages and inflammatory monocytes by inhibiting either the myeloid cell receptors CSF1R or CCR2 decreases the number of tumor-initiating cells in pancreatic tumors .	tumor promoting inflammation
23221383_s6	Targeting CCR2 or CSF1R improves chemotherapeutic efficacy , inhibits metastasis and increases antitumor T-cell responses .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
23221383_s7	Tumor-educated macrophages also directly enhanced the tumor-initiating capacity of pancreatic tumor cells by activating the transcription factor STAT3 , thereby facilitating macrophage-mediated suppression of CD8+ T lymphocytes .	avoiding immune destruction
23221383_s8	Together , our findings show how targeting tumor-infiltrating macrophages can effectively overcome therapeutic resistance mediated by tumor-initiating cells .	
23221387_s0	The glutathione peroxidases , a family of selenocysteine-containing redox enzymes , play pivotal roles in balancing the signaling , immunomodulatory , and deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .	
23221387_s1	The glutathione peroxidase GPX3 is the only extracellular member of this family , suggesting it may defend cells against ROS in the extracellular environment .	
23221387_s2	Notably , GPX3 hypermethylation and underexpression occur commonly in prostate , gastric , cervical , thyroid , and colon cancers .	
23221387_s3	We took a reverse genetics approach to investigate whether GPX3 would augment inflammatory colonic tumorigenesis , a process characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation , comparing Gpx3(-/-) mice in an established two-stage model of inflammatory colon carcinogenesis .	
23221387_s4	Gpx3-deficient mice exhibited an increased tumor number , though not size , along with a higher degree of dysplasia .	
23221387_s5	In addition , they exhibited increased inflammation with redistribution toward protumorigenic M2 macrophage subsets , increased proliferation , hyperactive WNT signaling , and increased DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
23221387_s6	To determine the impact of acute gene loss in an established colon cancer line , we silenced GPX3 in human Caco2 cells , resulting in increased ROS production , DNA damage and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress , combined with decreased contact-independent growth .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23221387_s7	Taken together , our results suggested an immunomodulatory role for GPX3 that limits the development of colitis-associated carcinoma .	
23223128_s0	Low-dose cyclophosphamide ( CP ) therapy induces immunogenic tumor cell death and decreases regulatory T cell ( Treg ) numbers in mice with transplantable tumors .	
23223128_s1	Using the ret transgenic murine melanoma model that resembles human melanoma , we detected no beneficial antitumor effects with such treatment , despite a decrease in Tregs .	
23223128_s2	On the contrary , low-dose CP enhanced the production of chronic inflammatory mediators in melanoma lesions associated with increased accumulation of Gr1(+)CD11b(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) , which exhibit elevated suppressive activity and nitric oxide ( NO ) production as well as inhibition of T-cell proliferation .	tumor promoting inflammation
23223128_s3	Moreover , the frequencies of CD8(+) T cells in the tumors and their ability to produce perforin were decreased .	
23223128_s4	To study whether the observed CP-induced MDSC expansion and activation also occurs under chronic inflammatory tumor-free conditions , mice exhibiting chronic inflammation were treated with CP .	
23223128_s5	Similar to tumor-bearing mice , CP-treated inflamed mice displayed elevated levels of MDSCs with enhanced production of NO , reactive oxygen species , and a suppressed in vivo natural killer ( NK ) cell cytotoxic activity indicating CP effects on the host immune system independent of the tumor .	tumor promoting inflammation
23223128_s6	We suggest that melanoma therapy with low-dose CP could be efficient only when combined with the neutralization of MDSC immunosuppressive function and chronic inflammatory microenvironment.Journal of Investigative Dermatology advance online publication , 6 December 2012 ; doi:10.1038/jid.2012.444 .	
23223340_s0	BACKGROUND Young age is a favorable prognostic factor for patients with glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) .	
23223340_s1	We reviewed the outcomes and molecular tumor characteristics of adolescent and young adult patients with GBM treated in 2 Austrian centers .	
23223340_s2	PATIENTS AND METHODS Data on patients with histologically proven primary GBM diagnosed from 18 through 40 years of age were retrospectively analyzed .	
23223340_s3	All patients were treated with standard first-line therapy .	
23223340_s4	The primary end points were overall survival ( OS ) and time to progression ( TTP ) .	
23223340_s5	IDH1-R132H mutation status was analyzed using immunohistochemistry , and MGMT promoter methylation was assessed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction .	
23223340_s6	RESULTS We included 70 patients ( 36 men and 34 women ) with a median age of 33 years .	
23223340_s7	IDH1-R132H mutations were detected in 22 ( 39.3% ) of 56 cases and MGMT promoter methylation in 33 ( 61.1% ) of 54 cases with available tissue samples .	genomic instability and mutation
23223340_s8	In patients with wild-type IDH , median TTP was 8.2 months and median OS was 24 months , compared with 18 months and 44 months , respectively , observed in patients with mutated IDH .	genomic instability and mutation
23223340_s9	Neither IDH1 nor MGMT status showed a statistically significant association with TTP or OS .	
23223340_s10	Of note , the social and economical situation of the young patients with GBM was alarming , because only 17% succeeded in staying employed after receiving the diagnosis .	
23223340_s11	CONCLUSIONS We found a high frequency of IDH1 mutations and MGMT promoter methylation among young adult patients with primary GBM that may contribute to the generally favorable outcome associated with young age .	genomic instability and mutation
23223340_s12	The social and economic coverage of patients with glioma remains an unsolved socio-ethical problem .	
23224295_s0	Kinins and their receptors have been recently implicated in cancer .	
23224295_s1	Using functional and molecular approaches , we investigated the relevance of kinin B(1) and B(2) receptors in bladder cancer .	
23224295_s2	Functional studies were conducted using bladder cancer cell lines , and human biopsies were employed for molecular studies .	
23224295_s3	Both B(1) des-Arg(9)-BK and B(2) BK receptor agonists stimulated the proliferation of grade 3-derived T24 bladder cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23224295_s4	Furthermore , treatment with B(1) and B(2) receptor antagonists ( SSR240612 and HOE140 ) markedly inhibited the proliferation of T24 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23224295_s5	Only higher concentrations of BK increased the proliferation of the grade 1 bladder cancer cell line RT4 , while des-Arg(9)-BK completely failed to induce its proliferation .	
23224295_s6	Real-time PCR revealed that the mRNA expression of kinin receptors , particularly B(1) receptors , was increased in T24 cells relative to RT4 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23224295_s7	Data from bladder cancer human biopsies revealed that B(1) receptor expression was increased in all tumor samples and under conditions of chronic inflammation .	sustaining proliferative signaling,tumor promoting inflammation
23224295_s8	We also show novel evidence demonstrating that the pharmacological inhibition of PI3KÎ³ ( phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ) with AS252424 , concentration-dependently reduced T24 cell proliferation induced by BK or des-Arg(9)-BK .	
23224295_s9	Finally , the incubation of T24 cells with kinin agonists led to a marked activation of the PI3K/AKT and ERK 1/2 signaling pathways , whereas p38 MAP kinase remained unaffected .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23224295_s10	Kinin receptors , especially B(1) receptors , appear to be implicated in bladder cancer progression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23224295_s11	It is tempting to suggest that selective kinin antagonists might represent potential alternative therapies for bladder cancer .	
23226335_s0	Osteosarcoma is a high-grade malignant bone tumor that manifests ingravescent clinical behavior .	
23226335_s1	The intrinsic events that confer malignant properties on osteosarcoma cells have remained unclear , however .	
23226335_s2	We previously established two lines of mouse osteosarcoma cells : AX cells , which are able to form tumors in syngeneic mice , and AXT cells , which were derived from such tumors and acquired an increased tumorigenic capacity during tumor development .	
23226335_s3	We have now identified Igf2 mRNA-binding protein3 ( Imp3 ) as a key molecule responsible for this increased tumorigenicity of AXT cells in vivo .	
23226335_s4	Imp3 is consistently up-regulated in tumors formed by AX cells , and its expression in these cells was found to confer malignant properties such as anchorage-independent growth , loss of contact inhibition , and escape from anoikis in vitro .	evading growth suppressors
23226335_s5	The expression level of Imp3 also appeared directly related to tumorigenic ability in vivo which is the critical determination for tumor-initiating cells .	
23226335_s6	The effect of Imp3 on tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cells did not appear to be mediated through Igf2-dependent mechanism .	
23226335_s7	Our results implicate Imp3 as a key regulator of stem-like tumorigenic characteristics in osteosarcoma cells and as a potential therapeutic target for this malignancy .	
23226467_s0	Oxaliplatin is included in a number of effective combination regimens used as first and subsequent lines of therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer .	
23226467_s1	Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy plays a significant role in response to cancer therapy .	
23226467_s2	However , the role of autophagy in oxaliplatin-induced cell death remains to be clarified .	
23226467_s3	In this study , we showed that oxaliplatin induced cell death and autophagy in Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23226467_s4	The suppression of autophagy using either pharmacologic inhibitors ( 3-methyladenine , bafilomycin A1 ) or RNA interference in essential autophagy genes ( ATG5 or Beclin1 ) enhanced the cell death and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production induced by oxaliplatin in Caco-2 cells .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23226467_s5	Blocking oxaliplatin-induced ROS production by using ROS scavengers ( NAC or Tiron ) decreased autophagy .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23226467_s6	Furthermore , numerous dilated endoplasmic reticula ( ER ) were present in oxaliplatin-treated Caco-2 cells , and blocking ER stress by RNA interference against candidate of metastasis-1 ( P8 ) and C/EBP-homologous protein ( CHOP ) decreased autophagy and ROS production .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23226467_s7	Taken together , these data indicate that oxaliplatin activates autophagy as a cytoprotective response via ER stress and ROS in human colorectal cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23226513_s0	Lymphocytes are a key component of the immune system and their differentiation and function are directly influenced by cancer .	
23226513_s1	We examined peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) gene expression as a biomarker of illness and treatment effect using the Affymetrix Human Gene ST1 platform in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) who received combined treatment with IL-2 , interferon-?-2a and dendritic cell vaccine .	
23226513_s2	We examined gene expression , cytokine levels in patient serum and lymphocyte subsets as determined by flow cytometry ( FCM ) .	
23226513_s3	Pre-treatment PBLs from patients with mRCC exhibit a gene expression profile and serum cytokine profile consistent with inflammation and proliferation not found in healthy donors ( HD ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
23226513_s4	PBL gene expression from patients with mRCC showed increased mRNA of genes involved with T-cell and T(REG)-cell activation pathways , which was also reflected in lymphocyte subset distribution .	
23226513_s5	Overall , PBL gene expression post-treatment ( POST ) was not significantly different than pre-treatment ( PRE ) .	
23226513_s6	Nevertheless , treatment related changes in gene expression ( post-treatment minus pre-treatment ) revealed an increased expression of T-cell and B-cell receptor signaling pathways in responding ( R ) patients compared to non-responding ( NR ) patients .	
23226513_s7	In addition , we observed down-regulation of T(REG)-cell pathways post-treatment in R vs. NR patients .	
23226513_s8	While exploratory in nature , this study supports the hypothesis that enhanced inflammatory cytotoxic pathways coupled with blunting of the regulatory pathways is necessary for effective anti-cancer activity associated with immune therapy .	tumor promoting inflammation
23226513_s9	This type of analysis can potentially identify additional immune therapeutic targets in patients with mRCC .	tumor promoting inflammation
23226724_s0	Metastasis , commonly to the lung , is the major cause of mortality from testicular cancer .	
23226724_s1	The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a novel nutrient mixture ( NM ) containing ascorbic acid , amino acids and green tea extract on the inhibition of melanoma growth and metastasis using a model of intratesticular inoculation of B16FO cells into nude mice .	
23226724_s2	Male athymic mice ( n=12 ) , 10-12 weeks of age , were inoculated with 5ï¿½10(5) B16FO melanoma cells in 100 Î¼l of PBS into the right testis , while the left testis was left untreated .	
23226724_s3	Following inoculation , the mice were randomly divided into two groups .	
23226724_s4	The control group ( n=6 ) was fed a regular mouse chow diet and the NM 1% group ( n=6 ) the same diet , but supplemented with 1% NM .	
23226724_s5	Four weeks later the mice were sacrificed and the abdominal cavity was opened .	
23226724_s6	Mice in the control group exhibited extensive metastasis in the peritoneal cavity and severely enlarged right testes and necrotic seminiferous tubules .	activating invasion and metastasis
23226724_s7	By contrast , in the NM 1% fed group there was no evidence of peritoneal metastasis in 50% of the animals and mild metastasis in the remaining 50% .	activating invasion and metastasis
23226724_s8	The right testes were enlarged and seminiferous tubules in the area of invasion showed evidence of degeneration .	activating invasion and metastasis
23226724_s9	No metastasis to the liver , kidney or spleen were evident in either group .	activating invasion and metastasis
23226724_s10	However , severe lung metastasis was observed in 2 of 6 mice in the control group and mild metastasis in 2 of 6 mice in the NM 1% group .	activating invasion and metastasis
23226724_s11	In conclusion , these results confirm earlier studies and verify the anti-metastatic potential of NM .	activating invasion and metastasis
23227181_s0	The prediction of tumor behavior for patients with oral carcinomas remains a challenge for clinicians .	
23227181_s1	The presence of lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor but it is limited in predicting local relapse or survival .	
23227181_s2	This highlights the need for identifying biomarkers that may effectively contribute to prediction of recurrence and tumor spread .	
23227181_s3	In this study , we used one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , mass spectrometry and immunodetection methods to analyze protein expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas .	
23227181_s4	Using a refinement for classifying oral carcinomas in regard to prognosis , we analyzed small but lymph node metastasis-positive versus large , lymph node metastasis-negative tumors in order to contribute to the molecular characterization of subgroups with risk of dissemination .	
23227181_s5	Specific protein patterns favoring metastasis were observed in the " more-aggressive " group defined by the present study .	
23227181_s6	This group displayed upregulation of proteins involved in migration , adhesion , angiogenesis , cell cycle regulation , anti-apoptosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition , whereas the " less-aggressive " group was engaged in keratinocyte differentiation , epidermis development , inflammation and immune response .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling,tumor promoting inflammation
23227181_s7	Besides the identification of several proteins not yet described as deregulated in oral carcinomas , the present study demonstrated for the first time the role of cofilin-1 in modulating cell invasion in oral carcinomas .	activating invasion and metastasis
23229313_s0	Topoisomerase 1 ( Top1)-DNA cleavage complexes induced by camptothecin ( CPT ) cause DNA strand breaks during DNA replication or transcription .	
23229313_s1	Although the cellular responses to replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks have been well studied , the responses to transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks have not .	
23229313_s2	Here , we show that poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) and cockayne syndrome group B protein ( CSB ) modulate the CPT-induced formation of discrete p53-binding protein 1 ( 53BP1 ) nuclear foci at sites of transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks .	genomic instability and mutation
23229313_s3	Inhibition of PARP activity enhanced the formation of these foci , while knockdown of essential components of the base excision repair ( BER ) pathway did not .	genomic instability and mutation
23229313_s4	These findings suggest that PARP suppresses transcription-mediated 53BP1 foci formation , but that this does not occur through the BER pathway .	genomic instability and mutation
23229313_s5	In addition , knockdown of CSB , one of the key factors of transcription-coupled repair , slowed the kinetics of 53BP1 foci formation .	
23229313_s6	These data suggest that PARP and CSB modulate the formation of 53BP1 foci during the processing of transcription-mediated DNA strand breaks .	genomic instability and mutation
23229340_s0	Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved , multi-step lysosomal degradation process in which a cell degrades its own long-lived proteins and damaged organelles .	
23229340_s1	Ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) has recently been shown to upregulate the process of autophagy .	
23229340_s2	Previous studies showed that certain microRNAs , including miR-18a , potentially regulate ATM in cancer cells .	
23229340_s3	However , the mechanisms behind the modulation of ATM by miR-18a remain to be elucidated in colon cancer cells .	
23229340_s4	In the present study , we explored the impact of miR-18a on the autophagy process and ATM expression in HCT116 colon cancer cells .	
23229340_s5	To determine whether a preliminary link exists between autophagy and miR-18a , HCT116 cells were irradiated and quantitative ( q ) PCR was performed to measure miR-18a expression .	
23229340_s6	HCT116 cells were transfected with an miR-18a mimic to study its impact on indicators of autophagy .	
23229340_s7	Western blotting and luciferase assays were implemented to explore the impact of miR-18a on ATM gene expression in HCT116 cells .	
23229340_s8	The results showed that miR-18a expression was strongly stimulated by radiation .	
23229340_s9	Ectopic overexpression of miR-18a in HCT116 cell lines potently enhanced autophagy and ionizing radiation-induced autophagy .	resisting cell death
23229340_s10	Moreover , miR-18a overexpression led to the upregulation of ATM expression and suppression of mTORC1 activity .	
23229340_s11	Results of the present study pertaining to the role of miR-18a in regulating autophagy and ATM gene expression in colon cancer cells revealed a novel function for miR-18a in a critical cellular event and on a crucial gene with significant impacts in cancer development , progression , treatment and in other diseases .	resisting cell death
23229497_s0	SCOPE Glyceollins are a novel class of soybean phytoalexins with potential cancer-preventive and antiestrogenic effects .	
23229497_s1	The angiogenic cascade during tumor development consists of the release of angiogenic factors and binding of angiogenic factors to receptors on endothelial cells to activate downstream signaling pathways .	
23229497_s2	However , the potential medicinal value of glyceollins , especially in antiangiogenesis , remains unexplored .	
23229497_s3	METHODS AND RESULTS Here , we investigated the antiangiogenic activity of glyceollins and their underlying mechanisms .	
23229497_s4	Glyceollins inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) or basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) induced in vitro angiogenic activity .	inducing angiogenesis
23229497_s5	Glyceollins inhibited VEGF receptor-2 or FGF receptor-1 activity and their downstream signaling pathways such as extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 , c-Jun N-terminal kinase , as well as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and focal adhesion kinase induced by VEGF or bFGF .	inducing angiogenesis
23229497_s6	Glyceollins significantly suppressed VEGF receptor-2 kinase activity assayed by the ELISA .	inducing angiogenesis
23229497_s7	Glyceollins significantly attenuated in vivo and ex vivo microvessel development in a dose-dependent manner and tumor growth by suppressing microvessel density in Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) mouse xenograft .	inducing angiogenesis
23229497_s8	CONCLUSION Thus , glyceollins , elicited ingredients of soy source , target the signaling pathways mediated by VEGF or bFGF , providing new perspectives into potential therapeutics for preventing and treating hypervascularized diseases including cancer .	inducing angiogenesis
23230145_s0	The tumor suppressors Lats1 and Lats2 are mediators of the Hippo pathway that regulates tissue growth and proliferation .	
23230145_s1	Their N-terminal non-kinase regions are distinct except for Lats conserved domains 1 and 2 ( LCD1 and LCD2 ) , which may be important for Lats1/2-specific functions .	
23230145_s2	Lats1 knockout mice were generated by disrupting the N-terminal region containing LCD1 ( Lats1(ΔN/ΔN) ) .	
23230145_s3	Some Lats1(ΔN/ΔN) mice were born safely and grew normally .	
23230145_s4	However , mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) from Lats1(ΔN/ΔN) mice displayed mitotic defects , centrosomal overduplication , chromosomal misalignment , multipolar spindle formation , chromosomal bridging and cytokinesis failure .	
23230145_s5	They also showed anchorage-independent growth and continued cell cycles and cell growth , bypassing cell-cell contact inhibition similar to tumor cells .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23230145_s6	Lats1(ΔN/ΔN) MEFs produced tumors in nude mice after subcutaneous injection , although the tumor growth rate was much slower than that of ordinary cancer cells .	
23230145_s7	Yap , a key transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway , was overexpressed and stably retained in Lats1(ΔN/ΔN) MEFs in a cell density independent manner , and Lats2 mRNA expression was downregulated .	
23230145_s8	In conclusion , N-terminally truncated Lats1 induced Lats2 downregulation and Yap protein accumulation , leading to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis .	genomic instability and mutation
23231968_s0	Bigelovin is a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the plant Inula helianthus-aquatica which was traditionally used in cancer treatment in Yunnan , China .	
23231968_s1	The potent apoptotic activities of bigelovin in human leukemia U937 cells were shown in our previous study .	
23231968_s2	The present study investigated the anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory effects of bigelovin using transgenic zebrafish Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 with fluorescent blood vessels and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) , respectively .	
23231968_s3	Furthermore , the inhibitory activities of bigelovin on the human endothelial cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) were also examined .	
23231968_s4	Our results showed that the growth of subintestinal vessels of the bigelovin-treated zebrafish embryos was significantly inhibited and the gene expressions in angiogenesis signaling pathways ( e.g .	inducing angiogenesis
23231968_s5	Ang2 and Tie2 ) of the zebrafish were down-regulated after bigelovin treatment .	inducing angiogenesis
23231968_s6	Besides , the proliferation and Th1 cytokines productions ( e.g .	
23231968_s7	IFN-Î³ , IL-2 and IL-12 ) were suppressed in bigelovin-treated PBMCs .	
23231968_s8	On the other hand , bigelovin was shown to significantly inhibit the human monocyte adhesion to human endothelial cells and the gene expressions of inflammation-related CAMs ( e.g .	tumor promoting inflammation
23231968_s9	ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 and E-selectin ) were significantly down-regulated in bigelovin-treated human endothelial cells .	tumor promoting inflammation
23231968_s10	In summary , our data provide the first evidence that bigelovin possesses anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory activities , suggesting bigelovin may exert multi-target functions against cancer in animal models .	inducing angiogenesis,tumor promoting inflammation
23232078_s0	Adipose tissue growth and development are thought to be associated with angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling .	
23232078_s1	Because ginseng has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) activity , we hypothesized that adipose tissue growth and obesity can be regulated by Korean ginseng ( Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer ) .	
23232078_s2	Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were fed for 8 weeks with a low fat diet , a high fat diet ( HFD ) , or HFD supplemented with 0.5% or 5% Korean red ginseng extract .	
23232078_s3	We measured body weight , adipose tissue mass , food intake , MMP activity , and the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and MMPs .	
23232078_s4	Administering ginseng to HFD-induced obese mice produced reductions in body weight and adipose tissue mass compared with untreated counterparts .	
23232078_s5	Ginseng treatment decreased blood vessel density and MMP activity in adipose tissues .	inducing angiogenesis
23232078_s6	Ginseng also reduced mRNA levels of angiogenic factors ( e.g. , VEGF-A and FGF-2 ) and MMPs ( e.g. , MMP-2 and MMP-9 ) , whereas it increased mRNA levels of angiogenic inhibitors ( e.g. , TSP-1 , TIMP-1 , and TIMP-2 ) in adipose tissues .	inducing angiogenesis
23232078_s7	These results demonstrate that ginseng effectively reduces adipose tissue mass and prevents obesity in diet-induced obese mice and that this process may be mediated in part through the anti-angiogenic actions of ginseng .	inducing angiogenesis
23232401_s0	It is well known that ErbB2 , a receptor tyrosine kinase , localizes to the plasma membrane .	
23232401_s1	Here we describe a novel observation that ErbB2 also localizes in mitochondria of cancer cells and patient samples .	
23232401_s2	We found that ErbB2 translocates into mitochondria through association with mtHSP70 .	
23232401_s3	Additionally , mitochondrial ErbB2 ( mtErbB2 ) negatively regulates mitochondrial respiratory functions .	
23232401_s4	Oxygen consumption and activities of complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain were decreased in mtErbB2-overexpressing cells .	
23232401_s5	Mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP levels were also decreased .	
23232401_s6	In contrast , mtErbB2 enhanced cellular glycolysis .	cellular energetics
23232401_s7	The translocation of ErbB2 and its impact on mitochondrial function are kinase dependent .	
23232401_s8	Interestingly , cancer cells with higher levels of mtErbB2 were more resistant to the ErbB2-targeting antibody trastuzumab .	
23232401_s9	Our study provides a novel perspective on the metabolic regulatory function of ErbB2 and reveals that mtErbB2 has an important role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and cancer cell resistance to therapeutics .	cellular energetics
23232625_s0	Vascular integrity is fundamental to the formation of mature blood vessels and depends on a functional , quiescent endothelial monolayer .	
23232625_s1	However , how endothelial cells enter and maintain quiescence in the presence of angiogenic factors is still poorly understood .	
23232625_s2	Here we identify the fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) antagonist Sprouty2 ( Spry2 ) as a key player in mediating endothelial quiescence and barrier integrity in mouse aortic endothelial cells ( MAECs ) : Spry2 knockout MAECs show spindle-like shapes and are incapable of forming a functional , impermeable endothelial monolayer in the presence of FGF2 .	
23232625_s3	Whereas dense wild type cells exhibit contact inhibition and stop to proliferate , Spry2 knockout MAECs remain responsive to FGF2 and continue to proliferate even at high cell densities .	
23232625_s4	Importantly , the anti-proliferative effect of Spry2 is absent in sparsely plated cells .	
23232625_s5	This cell density-dependent Spry2 function correlates with highly increased Spry2 expression in confluent wild type MAECs .	
23232625_s6	Spry2 protein expression is barely detectable in single cells but steadily increases in cells growing to high cell densities , with hypoxia being one contributing factor .	
23232625_s7	At confluence , Spry2 expression correlates with intact cell-cell contacts , whereas disruption of cell-cell contacts by EGTA , TNFÎ± and thrombin decreases Spry2 protein expression .	evading growth suppressors
23232625_s8	In confluent cells , high Spry2 levels correlate with decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( Erk1/2 ) phosphorylation .	
23232625_s9	In contrast , dense Spry2 knockout MAECs exhibit enhanced signaling by Erk1/2 .	
23232625_s10	Moreover , inhibiting Erk1/2 activity in Spry2 knockout cells restores wild type cobblestone monolayer morphology .	
23232625_s11	This study thus reveals a novel Spry2 function , which mediates endothelial contact inhibition and barrier integrity .	evading growth suppressors
23233419_s0	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) is one of the most aggressive human neoplasms with extremely poor prognosis and a low survival rate .	
23233419_s1	Immunosuppressive cell populations , e.g. regulatory T cells ( Treg ) , appear to be important in PDAC , contributing to patient's poor prognosis .	
23233419_s2	Therefore , we investigated the PDAC microenvironment with a focus on conventional and regulatory T cells in view of their potential therapeutic importance .	
23233419_s3	We found that tumors from the murine Panc02 orthotopic model of PDAC were infiltrated with high numbers of Treg .	
23233419_s4	Remarkably , these cells exhibited the effector/memory phenotype , suggesting their enhanced suppressive activity and higher proliferation capacity .	
23233419_s5	Although we observed a steady increase in transforming growth factor-Î² ( TGF-Î² ) levels in the tumors , treatment with a specific inhibitor of TGF-Î² receptor I kinase failed to abrogate Treg accumulation .	
23233419_s6	A CCR4 antagonist did not affect Treg percentage in the tumor either .	
23233419_s7	However , intense Treg cell division in the tumor microenvironment was demonstrated , suggesting local proliferation as a major mechanism of Treg accumulation in PDAC .	
23233419_s8	Notably , this accumulation was reduced by low-dose gemcitabine administration , resulting in a modestly increased survival of PDAC mice .	
23233419_s9	Our results provide an insight into mechanisms of immunosuppression in PDAC , suggesting an important role for proliferative expansion of effector/memory Treg .	avoiding immune destruction
23233419_s10	Low-dose gemcitabine therapy selectively depletes Treg , providing a basis for new modalities of PDAC therapy .	
23235164_s0	Liver resection is now widely accepted as a potentially curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis .	
23235164_s1	However , the efficacy of surgical resection for gastric cancer liver metastasis(GLM)remains unclear .	
23235164_s2	Based on our 18-year experience with 64 patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for GLM , we discuss the indication and efficacy of surgical resection for GLM .	
23235164_s3	From January 1993 to January 2011 , 73 patients underwent hepatectomy for GLM in the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery , Cancer Institute Ariake Hospital(Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research ) , Japan .	
23235164_s4	The actuarial1 - , 3- , and 5-year overall survival rates and 1- , 3- , and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates of those 64 patients who achieved curative resections were 84 , 50 , and 37% , and 42 , 27 , and 27% , respectively .	
23235164_s5	By multivariate analysis , serosal invasion of the primary gastric cancer and larger hepatic tumor(&gt;5 cm in diameter)were found to be independent indicators of poor prognosis .	activating invasion and metastasis
23235164_s6	Based on the multivariate analysis results , all patients were divided into three groups no poor prognostic factor(n=38) , one poor prognostic factor(n=24) , and two poor prognostic factors(n=2) .	
23235164_s7	The actuarial overall survival rates of each group were 63 , 36 , and 0% at 3 years , and 53 , 15 , and 0% at 5 years .	
23235164_s8	GLM patients having hepatic tumors with the maximum diameter of &lt;5 cm , and without serosalinvasion of the primary gastric cancer , are the best candidates for hepatectomy .	activating invasion and metastasis
23236487_s0	BACKGROUND Treatment of head and neck cancer with radiation often results in damage to surrounding normal tissues such as salivary glands .	
23236487_s1	Permanent loss of function in the salivary glands often leads patients to discontinue treatment due to incapacitating side effects .	
23236487_s2	It has previously been shown that IGF-1 suppresses radiation-induced apoptosis and enhances G2/M arrest leading to preservation of salivary gland function .	
23236487_s3	In an effort to recapitulate the effects of IGF-1 , as well as increase the likelihood of translating these findings to the clinic , the small molecule therapeutic Roscovitine , is being tested .	
23236487_s4	Roscovitine is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that acts to transiently inhibit cell cycle progression and allow for DNA repair in damaged tissues .	
23236487_s5	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Treatment with Roscovitine prior to irradiation induced a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G(2)/M phase , as demonstrated by flow cytometry .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23236487_s6	In contrast , mice treated with radiation exhibit no differences in the percentage of cells in G(2)/M when compared to unirradiated controls .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23236487_s7	Similar to previous studies utilizing IGF-1 , pretreatment with Roscovitine leads to a significant up-regulation of p21 expression and a significant decrease in the number of PCNA positive cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23236487_s8	Radiation treatment leads to a significant increase in activated caspase-3 positive salivary acinar cells , which is suppressed by pretreatment with Roscovitine .	
23236487_s9	Administration of Roscovitine prior to targeted head and neck irradiation preserves normal tissue function in mouse parotid salivary glands , both acutely and chronically , as measured by salivary output .	
23236487_s10	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These studies suggest that induction of transient G(2)/M cell cycle arrest by Roscovitine allows for suppression of apoptosis , thus preserving normal salivary function following targeted head and neck irradiation .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23236487_s11	This could have an important clinical impact by preventing the negative side effects of radiation therapy in surrounding normal tissues .	
23238993_s0	TP53 mutations compromising p53 transcriptional function occur in more than 50% of human cancers , including pancreatic adenocarcinoma , and render cancer cells more resistant to conventional therapy .	
23238993_s1	In the last few years , many efforts have been addressed to identify p53-reactivating molecules able to restore the wild-type transcriptionally competent conformation of the mutated proteins .	
23238993_s2	Here , we show that two of these compounds , CP-31398 and RITA , induce cell growth inhibition , apoptosis , and autophagy by activating p53/DNA binding and p53 phosphorylation ( Ser15 ) , without affecting the total p53 amount .	resisting cell death
23238993_s3	These effects occur in both wild-type and mutant p53 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines , whereas they are much less pronounced in normal human primary fibroblasts .	
23238993_s4	Furthermore , CP-31398 and RITA regulate the axis SESN1-2/AMPK/mTOR by inducing AMPK phosphorylation on Thr172 , which has a crucial role in the autophagic response .	resisting cell death
23238993_s5	The protective role of autophagy in cell growth inhibition by CP-31398 and RITA is supported by the finding that the AMPK inhibitor compound C or the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine or 3-methyladenine sensitize both pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines to the apoptotic response induced by p53-reactivating molecules .	resisting cell death
23238993_s6	Our results demonstrate for the first time a survival role for autophagy induced by p53-reactivating molecules , supporting the development of an anti-cancer therapy based on autophagy inhibition associated to p53 activation .	resisting cell death
23241438_s0	Heparanase is a mammalian endoglycosidase that degrades heparan sulfate at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix .	
23241438_s1	The expression of heparanase was detected in a wide variety of human malignant tumors and closely associated with tumor invasion , metastasis , and angiogenesis .	
23241438_s2	However , the specific roles of heparanase and its mechanisms of regulating the malignant potential of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells still remain unclear .	
23241438_s3	In the present study , the expression of heparanase was down-regulated in NSCLC cell line by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide .	
23241438_s4	Results showed that down-regulation of heparanase led to significant inhibition of invasive and proliferative potentials of A549 cells in vitro and in vivo .	activating invasion and metastasis
23241438_s5	Further research demonstrated that down-regulation of heparanase significantly inhibited the angiogenic potential of A549 cells , which might be the mechanism responsible for the inhibition of A549 cell proliferation in BALB/c nude mice in vivo .	inducing angiogenesis
23241438_s6	These findings demonstrate that heparanase plays essential roles in regulating the invasion , proliferation , and angiogenesis of A549 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23241743_s0	The role of regulatory T cells ( T(regs) ) in human colon cancer ( CC ) remains controversial : high densities of tumor-infiltrating T(regs) can correlate with better or worse clinical outcomes depending on the study .	
23241743_s1	In mouse models of cancer , T(regs) have been reported to suppress inflammation and protect the host , suppress T cells and protect the tumor , or even have direct cancer-promoting attributes .	
23241743_s2	These different effects may result from the presence of different T(reg) subsets .	
23241743_s3	We report the preferential expansion of a T(reg) subset in human CC with potent T cell-suppressive , but compromised anti-inflammatory , properties ; these cells are distinguished from T(regs) present in healthy donors by their coexpression of Foxp3 and RORÎ³t .	
23241743_s4	T(regs) with similar attributes were found to be expanded in mouse models of hereditary polyposis .	
23241743_s5	Indeed , ablation of the RORÎ³t gene in Foxp3(+) cells in polyp-prone mice stabilized T(reg) anti-inflammatory functions , suppressed inflammation , improved polyp-specific immune surveillance , and severely attenuated polyposis .	tumor promoting inflammation
23241743_s6	Ablation of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , IL-23 , IL-17 , or tumor necrosis factor-Î± in polyp-prone mice reduced polyp number but not to the same extent as loss of RORÎ³t .	
23241743_s7	Surprisingly , loss of IL-17A had a dual effect : IL-17A-deficient mice had fewer polyps but continued to have RORÎ³t(+) T(regs) and developed invasive cancer .	
23241743_s8	Thus , we conclude that RORÎ³t has a central role in determining the balance between protective and pathogenic T(regs) in CC and that T(reg) subtype regulates inflammation , potency of immune surveillance , and severity of disease outcome .	tumor promoting inflammation
23242121_s0	Îuclear factor-ÎºB ( NF-ÎºB ) and activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) are major transcription factors that have been associated with breast cancer metastasis by inducing matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) expression .	
23242121_s1	In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effects of guggulsterone isomers ( cis or trans ) on 12-O-tetradecanoylpho-bol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression .	
23242121_s2	Cis-guggulsterone inhibited TPA-induced MMP expression by blocking IÎºB kinase ( IKK)/NF-ÎºB signaling , whereas trans-guggulsterone blocked mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK)/AP-1 signaling .	
23242121_s3	Cis-guggulsterone was more potent than trans-guggulsterone in the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion of MCF-7 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23242121_s4	Furthermore , we found that the combination of these isomers exerted an additive effect on the inhibition of MCF-7 cell invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
23242121_s5	These results suggest that guggulsterone isomers downregulate MMP-9 expression and tumor cell invasion through the isomer-specific suppression of IKK/NF-ÎºB and MAPK/AP-1 activation .	activating invasion and metastasis
23242121_s6	In addition , the suppression of MMP-9 expression correlated well with the inhibition of cell invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
23242420_s0	Calcium ( Ca(2+) ) signals are involved in important checkpoints in cell death pathways and promote both apoptosis and autophagy .	
23242420_s1	However , the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in response to Ca(2+) level elevation is poorly understood .	
23242420_s2	Here , we provided evidence that the influx of extracellular Ca(2+) triggered by Trichokonin VI ( TK VI ) , an antimicrobial peptide , induced calpain-dependent apoptosis and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells .	resisting cell death
23242420_s3	Remarkably , TK VI preferentially induced apoptosis that was associated with calpain-mediated Bax and Atg5 cleavage , which resulted in the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release .	resisting cell death
23242420_s4	Interestingly , truncated , but not full-length Atg5 , associated with Bcl-xL and promoted the intrinsic pathway .	
23242420_s5	Moreover , TK VI treatment induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) accumulation , an effect in which Bak might play a major role .	tumor promoting inflammation
23242420_s6	This accumulation of ROS resulted in the subsequent disposal of damaged mitochondria within autophagosomes via Atg5-mediated and mitochondria-selective autophagy .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23242420_s7	Both the inhibition of calpain activity and Bax deficiency activated a switch that promoted an enhancement of autophagy .	resisting cell death
23242420_s8	The inhibition of both apoptosis and autophagy significantly attenuated the TK VI cytotoxicity , indicating that the two processes had stimulatory effects during TK VI-meditated cell death .	resisting cell death
23242420_s9	These results suggested that calpain , Bak and Atg5 were molecular links between autophagy and apoptosis and revealed novel aspects of the crosstalk between these two processes .	resisting cell death
23242420_s10	The potential of TK VI is proposed as a promising anticancer agent for its well-characterized activity of Ca(2+) agonist and as a possible novel therapeutic strategy that acts on cancer cell mitochondria .	
23243309_s0	Integrin αvβ3 plays a role in insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1 ) signaling ( integrin-IGF1 receptor ( IGF1R ) cross-talk ) in non-transformed cells in anchorage-dependent conditions .	
23243309_s1	We reported previously that IGF1 directly binds to αvβ3 and induces αvβ3-IGF1-IGF1R ternary complex formation in these conditions .	
23243309_s2	The integrin-binding defective IGF1 mutant ( R36E/R37E ) is defective in inducing ternary complex formation and IGF signaling , whereas it still binds to IGF1R .	
23243309_s3	We studied if IGF1 can induce signaling in anchorage-independent conditions in transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells that express αvβ3 ( β3-CHO ) cells .	
23243309_s4	Here we describe that IGF1 signals were more clearly detectable in anchorage-independent conditions ( polyHEMA-coated plates ) than in anchorage-dependent conditions .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23243309_s5	This suggests that IGF signaling is masked by signals from cell-matrix interaction in anchorage-dependent conditions .	
23243309_s6	IGF signaling required αvβ3 expression , and R36E/R37E was defective in inducing signals in polyHEMA-coated plates .	
23243309_s7	These results suggest that αvβ3-IGF1 interaction , not αvβ3-extracellular matrix interaction , is essential for IGF signaling .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23243309_s8	Inhibitors of IGF1R , Src , AKT , and ERK1/2 did not suppress αvβ3-IGF-IGF1R ternary complex formation , suggesting that activation of these kinases are not required for ternary complex formation .	
23243309_s9	Also , mutations of the β3 cytoplasmic tail ( Y747F and Y759F ) that block β3 tyrosine phosphorylation did not affect IGF1R phosphorylation or AKT activation .	genomic instability and mutation
23243309_s10	We propose a model in which IGF1 binding to IGF1R induces recruitment of integrin αvβ3 to the IGF-IGF1R complex and then β3 and IGF1R are phosphorylated .	
23243309_s11	It is likely that αvβ3 should be together with the IGF1-IGF1R complex for triggering IGF signaling .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23243586_s0	The ARF locus is frequently inactivated in human cancer .	
23243586_s1	The oncosuppressor ARF has indeed been described as a general sensor for different situation of cellular stress .	
23243586_s2	We have previously demonstrated that ARF deficiency severely impairs inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo , establishing a role for ARF in the regulation of innate immunity .	
23243586_s3	The aim of the present work was to get further insights into the immune functions of ARF and to evaluate its possible contribution to the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 or M2 phenotype .	
23243586_s4	Our results demonstrate that resting Arf(-/-) macrophages express high levels of Ym1 and Fizz-1 , two typical markers of alternatively-activated macrophages ( M2 ) .	
23243586_s5	Additionally , Arf(-/-) peritoneal macrophages showed an impaired response to lipopolysaccharide ( a classical inducer of M1 polaryzation ) and a reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines .	tumor promoting inflammation
23243586_s6	Moreover , upon stimulation with interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) , an inducer of the M2 phenotype , well established M2 markers such as Fizz-1 , Ym1 and arginase-1 were upregulated in Arf(-/-) as compared with wild type macrophages .	
23243586_s7	Accordingly , the cytokine and chemokine profile associated with the M2 phenotype was significantly overexpressed in Arf(-/-) macrophages responding to IL-4 .	
23243586_s8	In addition , multiple pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF and MMP-9 were also increased .	inducing angiogenesis
23243586_s9	In summary , these results indicate that ARF contributes to the polarization and functional plasticity of macrophages .	
23244773_s0	ABSTRACT : PurposeAutophagy has attracted attentions as a novel mechanism for tumor development .	
23244773_s1	In this study Human ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3 and multidrug-resistant phenotype SKVCR cells were used and the roles of autophagy in radiation-induced cell death were analyzed.Methods and materialsCell viability was examined by colony formation and cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) assay , 3MA and ZVAD were used to block autophagy and apoptosis , respectively .	
23244773_s2	Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect mRNA level and Western blot was used to detect protein expression , monodansylcadaverine ( MDC ) staining and flow cytometery were used for autophagy , apoptosis and cell cycle dynamics , respectively .	
23244773_s3	RESULTS : ( 1 ) The radiosensitivity exhibited differently in SKOV3 and SKVCR cells ( SKOV3 : D0=3.37 , SKVCR : D0= 4.18 ) ; compared with SKOV3 the constitutive expression of MAPLC3 in SKVCR was higher , but no change of Caspase-3 and cleaved Caspase-3 .	
23244773_s4	( 2 ) The ionizing radiation ( IR)- induced apoptosis and autophagy were significant in both cells ( P&lt;0.05 ) ; inhibition of apoptosis with ZVAD showed no impact on survival of SKOV3 and SKVCR cells after radiation , while inhibition of autophagy significantly decreased viability in SKVCR cells , for SKVO3 cells only low level of radiation ( 2 Gy and 4 Gy ) could decrease the viability(P&lt;0.05) .	resisting cell death
23244773_s5	( 3 ) ZVAD inhibited apoptosis and autophagy in both cells , 3MA inhibit apoptosis in SKOV3 , and promote apoptosis in SKVCR , together with inhibition of autophagy .	resisting cell death
23244773_s6	( 4 ) G2/M arrest was induced by radiation in both cells ; the accumulation of G2/M was more significant in SKOV3 , 3MA attenuated the radiation-induced S phase delay in SKVCR .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23244773_s7	CONCLUSION : IR-induced autophagy provides a self-protective mechanism against radiotherapy in SKVCR cells , the use of autophagy inhibitor , 3MA , increases the killing effects of radiation by inhibiting autophagy and radiation- induced S phase delay , also by the increase of apoptosis , which suggests a better therapeutic strategy in drug- resistant SKVCR ovarian cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23245831_s0	In normal human cells , oncogene-induced senescence ( OIS ) depends on induction of DNA damage response .	
23245831_s1	Oxidative stress and hyperreplication of genomic DNA have been proposed as major causes of DNA damage in OIS cells .	
23245831_s2	Here , we report that down-regulation of deoxyribonucleoside pools is another endogenous source of DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts ( NHFs ) undergoing HRAS(G12V)-induced senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
23245831_s3	NHF-HRAS(G12V) cells underexpressed thymidylate synthase ( TS ) and ribonucleotide reductase ( RR ) , two enzymes required for the entire de novo deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis , and possessed low dNTP levels .	
23245831_s4	Chromatin at the promoters of the genes encoding TS and RR was enriched with retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein and histone H3 tri-methylated at lysine 9 .	
23245831_s5	Importantly , ectopic coexpression of TS and RR or addition of deoxyribonucleosides substantially suppressed DNA damage , senescence-associated phenotypes , and proliferation arrest in two types of NHF-expressing HRAS(G12V) .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
23245831_s6	Reciprocally , short hairpin RNA-mediated suppression of TS and RR caused DNA damage and senescence in NHFs , although less efficiently than HRAS(G12V) .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
23245831_s7	However , overexpression of TS and RR in quiescent NHFs did not overcome proliferation arrest , suggesting that unlike quiescence , OIS requires depletion of dNTP pools and activated DNA replication .	
23245831_s8	Our data identify a previously unknown role of deoxyribonucleotides in regulation of OIS .	
23247530_s0	In this study , laboratory experiments were carried out in order to come to a better understanding of the fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) in the marine environment and especially on their bioaccumulation , biotransformation and genotoxic effects in fish .	
23247530_s1	Juveniles of turbot ( Scophthalmus maximus ) were exposed to PAHs through different routes via ( 1 ) a mixture of dissolved PAHs , ( 2 ) a PAH-polluted sediment and ( 3 ) an oil fuel elutriate .	
23247530_s2	Fish were exposed 4 days followed by a 6-day depuration period .	
23247530_s3	In each experiment , PAH concentrations in the seawater of the tanks were analysed regularly by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry .	
23247530_s4	Muscle and liver samples were also analysed for parent PAH levels and PAH bioconcentration factors were calculated .	
23247530_s5	Biotransformation was evaluated by measuring the levels of PAH metabolites in fish bile .	
23247530_s6	Genotoxicity was assessed by the alkaline comet assay .	
23247530_s7	Regardless of exposure route , the parent PAH concentrations in the liver and muscle showed a peak level 1 day after the beginning of the exposure , followed by a decrease up to the background level towards the end of the experiment , except for the exposure to dissolved PAHs for which levels were relatively low throughout the study .	
23247530_s8	As a consequence , no bioaccumulation was observed in fish tissues at the end of the experiment .	
23247530_s9	In contrast , regardless of exposure routes , a rapid production of biliary metabolites was observed throughout the whole exposure experiment .	
23247530_s10	This was especially true for 1-hydroxypyrene , the major metabolite of pyrene .	
23247530_s11	After 6 days of recovery in clean water , a significant decrease in the total metabolite concentrations occurred in bile .	
23247530_s12	Fish exposed through either route displayed a significant increase in DNA strand breaks after 4 days of exposure , and significant correlations were observed between the level of biliary PAH metabolites and the level of DNA lesions in fish erythrocytes .	genomic instability and mutation
23247530_s13	Overall results indicate that exposure to either a mixture of dissolved PAHs , a PAH-contaminated sediment or a dispersed oil fuel elutriate leads to biotransformation and increase in DNA damage in fish .	genomic instability and mutation
23247530_s14	The quantification of PAH metabolites in bile and DNA damage in erythrocytes appear to be suitable for environmental monitoring of marine pollution either in the case of accidental oil spills or sediment contamination .	genomic instability and mutation
23248097_s0	Cancer vaccines based on human tumor-associated antigens ( TAA ) have been tested in patients with advanced or recurrent cancer , in combination with or following standard therapy .	
23248097_s1	Their immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy has been difficult to properly evaluate in that setting characterized by multiple highly suppressive effects of the tumor and the standard therapy on the patient's immune system .	
23248097_s2	In animal models of human cancer , vaccines administered in the prophylactic setting are most immunogenic and effectively prevent cancer development and progression .	
23248097_s3	We report results of a clinical study that show that in patients without cancer but with a history of premalignant lesions ( advanced colonic adenomas , precursors to colon cancer ) , a vaccine based on the TAA MUC1 was highly immunogenic in 17 of 39 ( 43.6% ) of vaccinated individuals , eliciting high levels of anti-MUC1 immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) and long-lasting immune memory .	avoiding immune destruction
23248097_s4	Lack of response in 22 of 39 individuals was correlated with high levels of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSC ) prevaccination .	
23248097_s5	Vaccine-elicited MUC1-specific immune response and immune memory were not associated with significant toxicity .	avoiding immune destruction
23248097_s6	Our study shows that vaccines based on human TAAs are immunogenic and safe and capable of eliciting long-term memory that is important for cancer prevention .	avoiding immune destruction
23248097_s7	We also show that in the premalignant setting , immunosuppressive environment ( e.g. , high levels of MDSC ) might already exist in some individuals , suggesting an even earlier premalignant stage or preselection of nonimmunosuppressed patients for prophylactic vaccination .	avoiding immune destruction

23248265_s0	Evaluation of immune dysfunction during the tumor-bearing state is a critical issue in combating cancer .	
23248265_s1	In this study , we initially found that IL-6 , one of the cachectic factors , suppressed CD4(+) T cell-mediated immunity through downregulation of MHC class II by enhanced arginase activity of dendritic cells ( DC ) in tumor-bearing mice .	avoiding immune destruction
23248265_s2	We demonstrated that administration of Ab against IL-6R ( anti-IL-6R mAb ) greatly enhanced T cell responses and inhibited the growth of tumor in vivo .	
23248265_s3	We also found that IL-6 upregulated the expression of arginase-1 and arginase activity of DC in vitro .	
23248265_s4	Tumor-infiltrating CD11c(+) DC exhibited upregulated mRNA expression of arginase-1 but reduced expression of MHC class II in parallel with the increase in serum IL-6 levels at the late stage in tumor-bearing hosts .	
23248265_s5	However , the administration of anti-IL-6R mAb into tumor-bearing mice inhibited both the downmodulation of MHC class II and the upregulation of arginase-1 mRNA levels in DC .	
23248265_s6	Furthermore , we noted that N(Ï)-hydroxy-L-arginine or L-arginine , an arginase-1 inhibitor , blocked the reduction in MHC class II levels on CD11c(+) DC during the tumor-bearing state .	
23248265_s7	Finally , we demonstrated that the administration of N(Ï)-hydroxy-L-arginine at the peritumor site significantly enhanced CD4(+) T cell responses and inhibited tumor growth .	
23248265_s8	Thus , IL-6-mediated arginase activation and the subsequent reduction in MHC class II expression on DC appeared to be critical mechanisms for inducing dysfunction of the immune system in the tumor-bearing state .	avoiding immune destruction
23248265_s9	Blockade of the IL-6-arginase cascade is a promising tool to overcome the dysfunction of antitumor immunity in tumor-bearing hosts .	avoiding immune destruction
23248303_s0	The ASPP2 ( also known as 53BP2L ) tumor suppressor is a proapoptotic member of a family of p53 binding proteins that functions in part by enhancing p53-dependent apoptosis via its C-terminal p53-binding domain .	
23248303_s1	Mounting evidence also suggests that ASPP2 harbors important nonapoptotic p53-independent functions .	
23248303_s2	Structural studies identify a small G protein Ras-association domain in the ASPP2 N terminus .	
23248303_s3	Because Ras-induced senescence is a barrier to tumor formation in normal cells , we investigated whether ASPP2 could bind Ras and stimulate the protein kinase Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade .	
23248303_s4	We now show that ASPP2 binds to Ras-GTP at the plasma membrane and stimulates Ras-induced signaling and pERK1/2 levels via promoting Ras-GTP loading , B-Raf/C-Raf dimerization , and C-Raf phosphorylation .	
23248303_s5	These functions require the ASPP2 N terminus because BBP ( also known as 53BP2S ) , an alternatively spliced ASPP2 isoform lacking the N terminus , was defective in binding Ras-GTP and stimulating Raf/MEK/ERK signaling .	
23248303_s6	Decreased ASPP2 levels attenuated H-RasV12-induced senescence in normal human fibroblasts and neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes .	enabling replicative immortality
23248303_s7	Together , our results reveal a mechanism for ASPP2 tumor suppressor function via direct interaction with Ras-GTP to stimulate Ras-induced senescence in nontransformed human cells .	enabling replicative immortality
23249693_s0	ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : Chemokine receptor CXCR4 , together with its ligand CXCL12 , plays critical roles in cancer progression , including growth , metastasis and angiogenesis .	
23249693_s1	Ewing sarcoma is a sarcoma with poor prognosis despite current therapies , particularly for patients with advanced-stage disease .	
23249693_s2	Lungs and bone ( marrow ) , organs of predilection for ( primary/metastatic ) Ewing sarcoma , represent predominant CXCL12 sources .	
23249693_s3	METHODS : To gain insight into the role of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in Ewing sarcoma , CXCR4 , CXCL12 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha protein expression was studied in therapy-naive and metastatic tumors by immunohistochemistry .	
23249693_s4	CXCR4 function was assessed in vitro , by flow cytometry and proliferation/ cell viability assays , in the presence of recombinant CXCL12 and/or CXCR4-antagonist AMD3100 or under hypoxic conditions .	
23249693_s5	RESULTS : Whereas CXCR4 was predominantly expressed by tumor cells , CXCL12 was observed in both tumor and stromal areas .	
23249693_s6	Survival analysis revealed an ( expression level-dependent ) negative impact of CXCR4 expression ( p &lt ; 0.04 ) .	
23249693_s7	A role for the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in Ewing sarcoma growth was suggested by our observations that i ) CXCR4 expression correlated positively with tumor volume at diagnosis ( p = 0.013 ) , ii ) CXCL12 was present within the microenvironment of virtually all cases , iii ) CXCL12 induced proliferation of CXCR4-positive Ewing sarcoma cell lines , which could be abrogated by AMD3100 .	
23249693_s8	CXCR4 expression was not correlated with occurrence of metastatic disease .	activating invasion and metastasis
23249693_s9	Also , therapy-naive tumors demonstrated higher CXCR4 expression as compared to metastases ( p = 0.027 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23249693_s10	Evaluation of in vivo hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression and culture of cells under hypoxic conditions revealed no role for hypoxia in CXCR4 expression .	
23249693_s11	CONCLUSIONS : Together , our results imply a crucial role for the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in auto- and/or paracrine growth stimulation .	
23249693_s12	Integration of CXCR4-targeting strategies into first- and/or second-line treatment regimens may represent a promising treatment option for Ewing sarcoma .	
23249808_s0	The down-regulation of dominant oncogenes , including C-MYC , in tumor cells often leads to the induction of senescence via mechanisms that are not completely identified .	
23249808_s1	In the current study , we demonstrate that MYC-depleted melanoma cells undergo extensive DNA damage that is caused by the underexpression of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) and ribonucleotide reductase ( RR ) and subsequent depletion of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools .	genomic instability and mutation
23249808_s2	Simultaneous genetic inhibition of TS and RR in melanoma cells induced DNA damage and senescence phenotypes very similar to the ones caused by MYC-depletion .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
23249808_s3	Reciprocally , overexpression of TS and RR in melanoma cells or addition of deoxyribo-nucleosides to culture media substantially inhibited DNA damage and senescence-associated phenotypes caused by C-MYC depletion .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
23249808_s4	Our data demonstrate the essential role of TS and RR in C-MYC-dependent suppression of senescence in melanoma cells .	enabling replicative immortality
23250485_s0	Androgens regulate both the physiological development of the prostate and the pathology of prostatic diseases .	
23250485_s1	However , the mechanisms by which androgens exert their regulatory activities on these processes are poorly understood .	
23250485_s2	In this study , we have determined that androgens regulate overall cell metabolism and cell growth , in part , by increasing autophagy in prostate cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23250485_s3	Importantly , inhibition of autophagy using either pharmacological or molecular inhibitors significantly abrogated androgen-induced prostate cancer cell growth .	
23250485_s4	Mechanistically , androgen-mediated autophagy appears to promote cell growth by augmenting intracellular lipid accumulation , an effect previously demonstrated to be necessary for prostate cancer cell growth .	
23250485_s5	Further , autophagy and subsequent cell growth is potentiated , in part , by androgen-mediated increases in reactive oxygen species .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23250485_s6	These findings demonstrate a role for increased fat metabolism and autophagy in prostatic neoplasias and highlight the potential of targeting underexplored metabolic pathways for the development of novel therapeutics .	resisting cell death
23251575_s0	Testicular Germ Cell Tumors ( TGCT ) and patient-derived cell lines are extremely sensitive to cisplatin and other interstrand cross-link ( ICL ) inducing agents .	
23251575_s1	Nevertheless , a subset of TGCTs are either innately resistant or acquire resistance to cisplatin during treatment .	
23251575_s2	Understanding the mechanisms underlying TGCT sensitivity/resistance to cisplatin as well as the identification of novel strategies to target cisplatin-resistant TGCTs have major clinical implications .	
23251575_s3	Herein , we have examined the proficiency of five embryonal carcinoma ( EC ) cell lines to repair cisplatin-induced ICLs .	
23251575_s4	Using γH2AX staining as a marker of double strand break formation , we found that EC cell lines were either incapable of or had a reduced ability to repair ICL-induced damage .	genomic instability and mutation
23251575_s5	The defect correlated with reduced Homologous Recombination ( HR ) repair , as demonstrated by the reduction of RAD51 foci formation and by direct evaluation of HR efficiency using a GFP-reporter substrate .	genomic instability and mutation
23251575_s6	HR-defective tumors cells are known to be sensitive to the treatment with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor .	
23251575_s7	In line with this observation , we found that EC cell lines were also sensitive to PARP inhibitor monotherapy .	
23251575_s8	The magnitude of sensitivity correlated with HR-repair reduced proficiency and with the expression levels and activity of PARP1 protein .	
23251575_s9	In addition , we found that PARP inhibition strongly enhanced the response of the most resistant EC cells to cisplatin , by reducing their ability to overcome the damage .	
23251575_s10	These results point to a reduced proficiency of HR repair as a source of sensitivity of ECs to ICL-inducing agents and PARP inhibitor monotherapy , and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PARP can be exploited to target the stem cell component of the TGCTs ( namely ECs ) and to enhance the sensitivity of cisplatin-resistant TGCTs to standard treatments .	
23251664_s0	Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF ) is a member of the epidermal growth factor family and has a variety of physiological and pathological functions .	
23251664_s1	Modulation of HB-EGF activity might have a therapeutic potential in the oncology area .	
23251664_s2	We explored the therapeutic possibilities by characterizing the in vitro biological activity of anti-HB-EGF monoclonal antibody Y-142 .	
23251664_s3	EGF receptor ( EGFR ) ligand and species specificities of Y-142 were tested .	
23251664_s4	Neutralizing activities of Y-142 against HB-EGF were evaluated in EGFR and ERBB4 signaling .	
23251664_s5	Biological activities of Y-142 were assessed in cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis assays and compared with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab , the HB-EGF inhibitor CRM197 , and the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) antibody bevacizumab .	
23251664_s6	The binding epitope was determined with alanine scanning .	
23251664_s7	Y-142 recognized HB-EGF as well as the EGFR ligand amphiregulin , and bound specifically to human HB-EGF , but not to rodent HB-EGF .	
23251664_s8	In addition , Y-142 neutralized HB-EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and ERBB4 , and blocked their downstream ERK1/2 and AKT signaling .	
23251664_s9	We also found that Y-142 inhibited HB-EGF-induced cancer cell proliferation , endothelial cell proliferation , tube formation , and VEGF production more effectively than cetuximab and CRM197 and that Y-142 was superior to bevacizumab in the inhibition of HB-EGF-induced tube formation .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23251664_s10	Six amino acids in the EGF-like domain were identified as the Y-142 binding epitope .	
23251664_s11	Among the six amino acids , the combination of F115 and Y123 determined the amphiregulin cross-reactivity and that F115 accounted for the species selectivity .	
23251664_s12	Furthermore , it was suggested that the potent neutralizing activity of Y-142 was derived from its recognition of R142 and Y123 and its high affinity to HB-EGF .	
23251664_s13	Y-142 has a potent HB-EGF neutralizing activity that modulates multiple biological activities of HB-EGF including cancer cell proliferation and angiogenic activities .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23251664_s14	Y-142 may have a potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent for the treatment of HB-EGF-dependent cancers .	
23254198_s0	Breast cancer incidence is increased in women receiving menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin but not with estrogen alone .	
23254198_s1	The use of a tissue-selective estrogen complex ( TSEC ) has been proposed as a novel menopausal hormone therapy strategy to eliminate the requirement for a progestogen .	
23254198_s2	Combination of bazedoxifene ( BZA ) with conjugated estrogens ( CEs ) , the first TSEC , has shown beneficial effects .	
23254198_s3	Whether it would exert antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer is not clear .	
23254198_s4	To address this issue , we compared estradiol ( E(2) ) and CE alone on proliferation and apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells .	
23254198_s5	CE stimulated growth of MCF-7 cells at a peak concentration 10-fold higher than required for E(2) .	
23254198_s6	Both CE and E(2) alone increased DNA synthesis and reduced apoptosis with activation of MAPK , Akt , and p70S6K and up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors survivin , Bcl-2 , and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein , These effects could be completely blocked by BZA .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23254198_s7	Gene expression studies demonstrated that CE and E(2) were equally potent on expression of cMyc , pS2 , and WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2 , whereas the stimulatory effects of CE on progesterone receptor and amphiregulin expression were weaker than E(2) .	
23254198_s8	BZA effectively blocked each of these effects and showed no estrogen agonistic effects when used alone .	
23254198_s9	Our results indicate that the stimulatory effects of E(2) or CE on breast cancer cells could be completely abrogated by BZA .	
23254198_s10	These studies imply that the CE/BZA , TSEC , exerts antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer cells and might block the growth of occult breast neoplasms in postmenopausal women , resulting in an overall reduction in tumor incidence .	
23254288_s0	Gliomas display anoikis resistance , enhanced invasion in to the adjacent brain parenchyma and eventually recur despite using the standard therapies .	
23254288_s1	Our studies on increased anoikis sensitization in matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2)-knockdown 4910 and 5310 human glioma xenograft cells were interestingly correlated with p21-activated kinase 4 ( PAK4 ) inhibition , prompting us to further investigate the role of PAK4 in glioma .	
23254288_s2	Here , we report the PAK4 upregulation in positive correlation with increasing glioma pathological grades .	
23254288_s3	The siRNA-mediated PAK4 knockdown elevated anoikis , and inhibited invasion and migration by downregulating MMP-2 , Î±vÎ²3-integrin and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor ( phospho-EGFR ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23254288_s4	The cDNA-PCR arrays revealed a transcriptional suppression of essential proteins involved in cell proliferation and adhesion in PAK4-knockdown cells .	
23254288_s5	Most importantly , glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated the MMP-2 as a new PAK4-interacting protein which binds to PAK4 kinase domain .	
23254288_s6	Individual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor and Î±vÎ²3 antibody treatments in PAK4si-treated cells indicated the regulation of Î±vÎ²3/EGFR survival signaling by PAK4 .	
23254288_s7	Overexpression of PAK4 significantly reversed the MMP2si-induced cell death in both cell lines .	resisting cell death
23254288_s8	Codepletion of PAK4 and MMP-2 resulted in robust anoikis-mediated cell death , and severely inhibited invasive and migratory properties in these cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23254288_s9	PAK4si inhibited in vivo tumor growth in nude mice by inhibiting MMP-2 , Î²3-integrin and phospho-EGFR levels in tumors .	
23254288_s10	Our findings indicate a physical association between PAK4 and MMP-2 , and suggest the future therapeutic potential of PAK4/MMP-2 dual targeting in glioma treatment .	
23254306_s0	Lowering the threshold of cellular senescence , the process employed by cells to thwart abnormal cell proliferation , though inhibition of CDK2 or Skp2 ( regulator of CDK inhibitors ) has been recently suggested as a potential avenue for cancer treatment .	
23254306_s1	In this study , we employ a published mathematical model of G1/S transition involving the DNA-damage signal transduction pathway to conduct carefully constructed computational experiments to highlight the effectiveness of manipulating cellular senescence in inhibiting damaged cell proliferation .	
23254306_s2	We first demonstrate the suitability of the mathematical model to explore senescence by highlighting the overlap between senescence pathways and those involved in G1/S transition and DNA damage signal transduction .	
23254306_s3	We then investigate the effect of CDK2 deficiency on senescence in healthy cells , followed by effectiveness of CDK2 deficiency in triggering senescence in DNA damaged cells .	
23254306_s4	For this , we focus on the behaviour of CycE , whose peak response indicates G1/S transition , for several reduced CDK2 levels in healthy as well as two DNA-damage conditions to calculate the probability ( β ) or the percentage of CDK2 deficient cells passing G1/S checkpoint ( (1-β) indicates level of senescence ) .	
23254306_s5	Results show that 50% CDK2 deficiency can cause senescence in all healthy cells in a fairly uniform cell population ; whereas , most healthy cells ( ≈67% ) in a heterogeneous population escape senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
23254306_s6	This finding is novel to our study .	
23254306_s7	Under both low- and high-DNA damaged conditions , 50% CDK deficiency can cause 65% increase in senescence in a heterogeneous cell population .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
23254306_s8	Furthermore , the model analyses the relationship between CDK2 and its CKIs ( p21 , p27 ) to help search for other effective ways to bring forward cellular senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors
23254306_s9	Results show that the degradation rate of p21 and initial concentration of p27 are effective in lowering CDK2 levels to lower the senescence threshold .	enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors
23254306_s10	Specifically , CDK2 and p27 are the most effective in triggering senescence while p21 having a smaller influence .	
23254306_s11	While receiving experimental support , these findings specify in detail the inhibitory effects of CKIs .	
23254306_s12	However , simultaneous variation of CDK2 and CKIs produces a dramatic reduction of damage cells passing the G1/S with CDK2&amp;p27 combination causing senescence in almost all damaged cells .	
23254306_s13	This combined effect of CDK2&amp;CKIs on senescence is a novel contribution in this study .	
23254306_s14	A review of the crucial protein complexes revealed that the concentration of active CycE/CDK2-p that controls cell cycle arrest provides support for the above findings with CycE/CDK2-p undergoing the largest reduction ( over 100% ) under the combined CDK2&amp;CKI conditions leading to the arrest of most of the damaged cells .	
23254306_s15	Our study thus provides quantitative assessments for the previously published qualitative findings on senescence and highlights new avenues for bringing forward senescence bar .	
23255113_s0	Aurora A kinase has drawn considerable attention as a therapeutic target for cancer therapy .	
23255113_s1	However , the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of the anticancer effects of Aurora A kinase inhibition are still not fully understood .	
23255113_s2	Herein , we show that depletion of Aurora A kinase by RNA interference ( RNAi ) in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells upregulated FoxO1 in a p53-dependent manner , which induces cell cycle arrest .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23255113_s3	Introduction of an RNAi-resistant Aurora A kinase into Aurora A-knockdown cells resulted in downregulation of FoxO1 expression and rescued proliferation .	
23255113_s4	In addition , silencing of FoxO1 in Aurora A-knockdown cells allowed the cells to exit cytostatic arrest , which , in turn , led to massive cell death .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
23255113_s5	Our results suggest that FoxO1 is responsible for growth arrest at the G 2/M phase that is induced by Aurora A kinase inhibition .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23255470_s0	Environmental or occupational exposure to low doses of arsenic induces a series of health problems including cancer .	
23255470_s1	The molecular events in arsenic-induced carcinogenicity remain to be defined .	
23255470_s2	In the NuLi-1 immortalized human lung epithelial cell line with p53 and pRb deficiency , exposure to low doses of arsenic trioxide for 72âh promoted cell proliferation and upregulated the gene transcription levels of FOXM1 , CDC6 , CDC25A , and cyclin D1 , which are both critical cell cycle regulatory genes and proto-oncogenes .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23255470_s3	Continuous in vitro exposure to 1âï¿½M arsenic trioxide for 34 wks induced malignant cell transformation , as evidenced by enhanced anchorage-independent cell growth .	
23255470_s4	The expression of FOXM1 , CDC6 , CDC25A , and Cyclin D1 was dynamically elevated at the gene transcription and protein levels in the process of cell transformation .	
23255470_s5	The carcinogenic ability of transformed cell colonies coincides with the expression levels of FOXM1 in in vitro anchorage-independent growth assays and in vivo tumor xenograft formation assays .	
23255470_s6	In reverse , the knockdown of FOXM1 in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells or arsenic-transformed NuLi-1 cells significantly decreased anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor xenograft formation .	
23255470_s7	The transformed NuLi-1 cells showed genomic instability in the form of copy number variation ( CNV ) at chromosome 1 , 5 , 6 , 18 , and 20 , but not loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) .	
23255470_s8	These results showed for the first time that chronic exposure to low doses of arsenic trioxide promoted lung carcinogenicity , in part by aberrantly upregulating FOXM1 and its associated oncogenes , when the tumor suppressor genes p53 and pRb were inactivated. ï¿½ 2012 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .	
23255891_s0	Capsaicin , one of the major pungent ingredients found in red peppers , has been recently demonstrated to induce apoptosis in various malignant cell lines through an unclear mechanism .	
23255891_s1	In this study , the effect of capsaicin on proliferation and apoptosis in the human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 and its possible mechanism(s) of action were investigated .	
23255891_s2	The results of a Cell Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) assay revealed that capsaicin significantly decreased the viability of PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner .	
23255891_s3	Capsaicin induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PANC-1 cells as demonstrated by a flow cytometric assessment .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23255891_s4	Caspase-3 expression at both the protein and mRNA level was promoted following capsaicin treatment .	
23255891_s5	Furthermore , we revealed that phospho-PI3 Kinase p85 ( Tyr458 ) and phospho-Akt ( Ser473 ) in PANC-1 cells were downregulated in response to capsaicin .	
23255891_s6	Moreover , capsaicin gavage significantly inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cell xenografts in athymic nude mice .	
23255891_s7	An increased number of TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3 were observed in capsaicin-treated mice .	resisting cell death
23255891_s8	In vivo , capsaicin downregulated the expression of phospho-PI3 Kinase p85 ( Tyr458 ) and phospho-Akt ( Ser473 ) .	
23255891_s9	In conclusion , we have demonstrated that capsaicin is an inhibitor of growth of PANC-1 cells , and downregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway may be involved in capsaicin-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo .	resisting cell death
23255896_s0	Sorafenib is a multi-targeted agent and has been reported to have potent antitumor effects against various types of tumors , including human non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .	
23255896_s1	In this study , we explored in vitro the antitumor effects of sorafenib alone and in combination with gemcitabine in epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI)-resistant human lung cancer cell lines and the related molecular mechanisms .	
23255896_s2	The NSCLC cell lines A549 ( mutant KRAS ) , H1666 ( mutant BRAF ) and H1975 ( mutant EGFR-T790M ) were treated with sorafenib and gemcitabine alone and in combination .	
23255896_s3	The cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay , cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry , and alterations in signaling pathways were analyzed by western blotting .	
23255896_s4	We found that sorafenib exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibition in all three EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines .	
23255896_s5	When sorafenib was combined with gemcitabine , synergistic activity was observed in the A549 and H1666 cells and antagonistic activity was observed in the H1975 cells .	
23255896_s6	Sorafenib arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase , whereas gemcitabine arrested the cell cycle at the S phase .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23255896_s7	Sorafenib inhibited C-RAF and p-ERK in the A549 cells and B-RAF and p-ERK in the H1666 and H1975 cells .	
23255896_s8	The molecular mechanism of this synergism is that RAF/MEK/ERK which are activated by gemcitabine are efficiently suppressed by simultaneously administered sorafenib .	
23255896_s9	By contrast , the mechanism of antagonism may be due to mutual interference with the cell cycle in the H1975 cells .	
23255896_s10	In conclusion , we found that sorafenib exhibits antiproliferative effects in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines and when combined with gemcitabine demonstrates synergistic activity in A549 and H1666 cells but antagonistic activity in H1975 cells .	
23255939_s0	Radix of Asiasarum heterotropoides var. mandshuricum F. Maekawa ( A. radix ) has been prescribed for treating pain , allergies and inflammatory disorders in traditional oriental medicine .	
23255939_s1	However , only limited information on the anticancer effects of A. radix is currently available .	
23255939_s2	The aim of this study was to determine the anticancer effect of the ethanol extract of A. radix ( EEAR ) on HCT-116 human colon cancer cells and to investigate its underlying mechanisms of action .	
23255939_s3	EEAR significantly induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HCT-116 cells .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23255939_s4	EEAR-induced apoptosis was observed in parallel with activation of caspases and an increased ratio of Bax ( pro-apoptotic)/Bcl2 ( anti-apoptotic ) .	resisting cell death
23255939_s5	Western blot analyses revealed that EEAR elevated the expression of p53 and p21(Waf/Cip1) and decreased the expression of the regulator proteins of G2/M phase progression , such as cdc2 and cyclin B. The upregulation of p53 by EEAR was due to the increased levels of p53 mRNA without a similar increase in proteasome-mediated p53 degradation .	
23255939_s6	EEAR-induced apoptosis in HCT-116 cells was dependent on p53 expression , as determined by siRNA-mediated p53 knockdown .	resisting cell death
23255939_s7	Taken together , these results suggest that EEAR inhibits the growth of the HCT-116 cells through induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , which are mediated by p53 expression .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23255946_s0	Piceatannol has potent anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory , anticancer and antiproliferative effects .	
23255946_s1	However , little is known about the mechanism by which piceatannol inhibits invasion and metastasis .	
23255946_s2	The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of piceatannol on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in DU145 human prostate cancer cells .	
23255946_s3	The results revealed that MMP-9 activity was significantly increased in response to tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) .	
23255946_s4	However , treatment with piceatannol reversed TNF-α- and MMP-9-induced gelatin zymography and its gene expression .	
23255946_s5	In addition , a Matrigel invasion assay determined that piceatannol reduces the TNF-α-induced invasion of DU145 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23255946_s6	Nuclear factor-κ B ( NF-κB ) is a significant transcription factor that regulates numerous genes involved in tumor cell invasion and metastasis .	
23255946_s7	Therefore , whether piceatannol acts on NF-κB to regulate MMP-9 gene expression was analyzed .	
23255946_s8	The results revealed that piceatannol attenuates MMP-9 gene expression via the suppression of NF-κB activity .	
23255946_s9	Using a specific NF-κB inhibitor , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , it was confirmed that TNF-α-induced MMP-9 gene expression is primarily regulated by NF-κB activation .	
23255946_s10	Piceatannol inhibited NF-κB activity by suppressing nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 and p50 subunits .	
23255946_s11	Furthermore , TNF-α-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly downregulated in the presence of piceatannol .	
23255946_s12	The Akt inhibitor LY294002 caused a significant decrease in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activity and MMP-9 gene expression .	
23255946_s13	Overall , these data suggest that piceatannol inhibits TNF-α-induced invasion by suppression of MMP-9 activation via the Akt-mediated NF-κB pathway in DU145 prostate cancer cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23255952_s0	Gefitinib , the specific inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , may cause growth delay in cancer cell lines .	
23255952_s1	Thorough understanding of the downstream cellular signaling of gefitinib will facilitate the discovery of biomarkers for predicting outcomes and monitoring anti-EGFR therapies , and provide information for key targets for therapeutic intervention .	
23255952_s2	In this study , we investigated the role of transducer of erbB2.1 ( TOB1 ) in gefitinib therapy .	
23255952_s3	Using the lung carcinoma cell lines A549 and NCI-H1975 , the results suggested that gefitinib might mediate cell cycle arrest in lung cancer cells at least by targeting TOB1 expression .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23255952_s4	Gefitinib treatment caused cell cycle arrest predominantly at the G1 phase , which is associated with TOB1 nuclear translocation and its interaction with cyclin D1 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23255952_s5	We also showed that knockdown of TOB1 expression by RNAi rescued lung cancer cells from gefitinib-induced cell-proliferative arrest .	
23255952_s6	These results suggest that TOB1 interaction with cyclin D1 and nuclear translocation is directly involved in the gefitinib-induced anti-proliferative cell cycle arrest .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23257665_s0	Acute leukemia is a disorder of the hematopoietic system characterized by the expansion of a clonal population of cells blocked from differentiating into mature cells .	
23257665_s1	Recent studies have shown that chalcones and their derivatives induce apoptosis in different cell lines .	
23257665_s2	Since new compounds with biological activity are needed , the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of three synthetic chalcones , derived from 1-naphthaldehyde and 2-naphthaldehyde , on human acute myeloid leukemia K562 cells and on human acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells .	
23257665_s3	Based on the results , the most cytotoxic compound ( A1 ) was chosen for further analysis in six human acute leukemia cells and in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line ( HT-29 ) .	
23257665_s4	Chalcone A1 significantly reduced the cell viability of K562 , Jurkat , Kasumi , U937 , CEM and NB4 cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner when compared with the control group ( IC(50) values between â¼1.5Î¼M and 40Î¼M ) .	
23257665_s5	It was also cytotoxic to HL-29 cells .	
23257665_s6	To further examine its effect on normal cells , peripheral blood lymphocytes collected from healthy volunteers were incubated with the compound .	
23257665_s7	It has also been incubated with human fibroblasts cultured from bone marrow ( JMA ) .	
23257665_s8	Chalcone A1 is non-cytotoxic to PBL cells and to JMA cells .	
23257665_s9	A1 caused significant cell cycle arrest in all phases according to the cell line , and increased the proportion of cells in the sub G0/G1 phase .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23257665_s10	To evaluate whether this chalcone induced cell death via an apoptotic or necrotic pathway , cell morphology was examined using fluorescence microscopy .	
23257665_s11	Cells treated with A1 at IC(50) demonstrated the morphological characteristic of apoptosis , such as chromatin condensation and formation of apoptotic bodies .	resisting cell death
23257665_s12	Apoptosis was confirmed by externalization of phosphatidylserine , which was detected by the Annexin V-FITC method , and by DNA fragmentation .	resisting cell death
23257665_s13	The results suggest that chalcone A1 has potential as a new lead compound for cancer therapy .	
23257779_s0	Metformin is a well-established diabetes drug that prevents the onset of most types of human cancers in diabetic patients , especially by targeting cancer stem cells .	
23257779_s1	Metformin exerts its protective effects by functioning as a weak " mitochondrial poison, " as it acts as a complex I inhibitor and prevents oxidative mitochondrial metabolism ( OXPHOS ) .	
23257779_s2	Thus , mitochondrial metabolism must play an essential role in promoting tumor growth .	
23257779_s3	To determine the functional role of " mitochondrial health " in breast cancer pathogenesis , here we used mitochondrial uncoupling proteins ( UCPs ) to genetically induce mitochondrial dysfunction in either human breast cancer cells ( MDA-MB-231 ) or cancer-associated fibroblasts ( hTERT-BJ1 cells ) .	
23257779_s4	Our results directly show that all three UCP family members ( UCP-1/2/3 ) induce autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in human breast cancer cells , which results in significant reductions in tumor growth .	resisting cell death
23257779_s5	Conversely , induction of mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer-associated fibroblasts has just the opposite effect .	
23257779_s6	More specifically , overexpression of UCP-1 in stromal fibroblasts increases Î²-oxidation , ketone body production and the release of ATP-rich vesicles , which " fuels " tumor growth by providing high-energy nutrients in a paracrine fashion to epithelial cancer cells .	
23257779_s7	Hence , the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction are truly compartment-specific .	
23257779_s8	Thus , we conclude that the beneficial anticancer effects of mitochondrial inhibitors ( such as metformin ) may be attributed to the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction in the epithelial cancer cell compartment .	
23257779_s9	Our studies identify cancer cell mitochondria as a clear target for drug discovery and for novel therapeutic interventions .	
23257894_s0	Background:Sorafenib is the only drug approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) .	
23257894_s1	The bioenergetic propensity of cancer cells has been correlated to anticancer drug resistance , but such correlation is unclear in sorafenib resistance of HCC.Methods:Six sorafenib-naive HCC cell lines and one sorafenib-resistant HCC cell line ( Huh-7R ; derived from sorafenib-sensitive Huh-7 ) were used .	
23257894_s2	The bioenergetic propensity was calculated by measurement of lactate in the presence or absence of oligomycin .	
23257894_s3	Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) , a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase ( PDK ) inhibitor , and siRNA of hexokinase 2 ( HK2 ) were used to target relevant pathways of cancer metabolism .	
23257894_s4	Cell viability , mitochondrial membrane potential , and sub-G1 fraction were measured for in vitro efficacy .	
23257894_s5	Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and glucose uptake were also measured .	
23257894_s6	A subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was used for in vivo efficacy.Results:The bioenergetic propensity for using glycolysis correlated with decreased sorafenib sensitivity ( R(2)=0.9067 , among sorafenib-naive cell lines ; P=0.003 , compared between Huh-7 and Huh-7âR ) .	
23257894_s7	DCA reduced lactate production and increased ROS and ATP , indicating activation of oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) .	cellular energetics,tumor promoting inflammation
23257894_s8	DCA markedly sensitised sorafenib-resistant HCC cells to sorafenib-induced apoptosis ( sub-G1 ( combination vs sorafenib ) : Hep3B , 65.4Â±8.4% vs 13Â±2.9% ; Huh-7âR , 25.3Â± 5.7% vs 4.3Â±1.5% ; each P&lt;0.0001 ) , whereas siRNA of HK2 did not .	resisting cell death
23257894_s9	Sorafenib ( 10âmgâkg(-1) per day ) plus DCA ( 100âmgâkg(-1) per day ) also resulted in superior tumour regression than sorafenib alone in mice ( tumour size : -87% vs -36% , P&lt;0.001).Conclusion:The bioenergetic propensity is a potentially useful predictive biomarker of sorafenib sensitivity , and activation of OXPHOS by PDK inhibitors may overcome sorafenib resistance of HCC.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication , 20 December 2012 ; doi:10.1038/bjc.2012.559 www.bjcancer.com .	
23258707_s0	Trinucleotide repeat ( TNR ) expansions and deletions are associated with human neurodegenerative diseases and prostate cancer .	
23258707_s1	Recent studies have pointed to a linkage between oxidative DNA damage , base excision repair ( BER ) and TNR expansion , which is demonstrated by the observation that DNA polymerase β ( pol β ) gap-filling synthesis acts in concert with alternate flap cleavage by flap endonuclease 1 ( FEN1 ) to mediate CAG repeat expansions .	
23258707_s2	In this study , we provide the first evidence that the repair of a DNA base lesion can also contribute to CAG repeat deletions that were initiated by the formation of hairpins on both the template and the damaged strand of a continuous run of ( CAG)(20 ) or ( CAG)(25 ) repeats .	genomic instability and mutation
23258707_s3	Most important , we found that pol β not only bypassed one part of the large template hairpin but also managed to pass through almost the entire length of small hairpin .	
23258707_s4	The unique hairpin bypass of pol β resulted in large and small deletions in coordination with FEN1 alternate flap cleavage .	
23258707_s5	Our results provide new insight into the role of BER in modulating genome stability that is associated with human diseases .	genomic instability and mutation
23258740_s0	PURPOSE : Prostate cancer ( PCa ) development is often associated with deletion or silencing of tumor suppressor PTEN , a negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway , leading to resistance to various therapies .	
23258740_s1	Therefore , the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a central role in various cellular processes leading to malignant phenotype , and , consequently is an attractive target .	
23258740_s2	However , the efficacy of AKT inhibitors is limited by resistance mechanisms that result in minimal tumor cell death .	
23258740_s3	Methods:Effects of Akt inhibitor AZD5363 were investigated on cell proliferation , apoptosis , Akt pathway and survival mechanisms .	
23258740_s4	We then examined the impacts of inhibition of autophagy combined with AZD5363 on cell proliferation and apoptosis .	
23258740_s5	Furthermore , the anti-cancer activity of combination treatment of the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy ( chloroquine ) with Akt inhibitor AZD5363 was evaluated in PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts .	
23258740_s6	RESULTS : we show that AZD5363 affected Akt downstream pathway by reducing p-mTOR , p-P70S6K and p-S6K .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23258740_s7	While AZD5363 monotherapy induced G2 growth arrest and autophagy , it failed to induce significant apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 PCa cells .	resisting cell death
23258740_s8	Blocking autophagy using pharmacological inhibitors or genetic inhibitors enhanced cell death induced by AZD5363 in these PCa cells .	resisting cell death
23258740_s9	Importantly , the combination of AZD5363 with chloroquine significantly reduced tumor volume by 84.9% compared with the control group and by 77.5% compared with either drug alone in PC3 xenografts .	
23258740_s10	CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate that Akt inhibitor AZD5363 , synergizes with the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy , chloroquine , to induce apoptosis and delay tumor progression in PCa models that are resistant to monotherapy AZD5363 , providing a new therapeutic approach potentially translatable to patients .	resisting cell death
23259597_s0	BACKGROUND : Although quiescence ( reversible cell cycle arrest ) is a key part in the life history and fate of many mammalian cell types , the mechanisms of gene regulation in quiescent cells are poorly understood .	
23259597_s1	We sought to clarify the role of microRNAs as regulators of the cellular functions of quiescent human fibroblasts .	
23259597_s2	RESULTS : Using microarrays , we discovered that the expression of the majority of profiled microRNAs differed between proliferating and quiescent fibroblasts .	
23259597_s3	Fibroblasts induced into quiescence by contact inhibition or serum starvation had similar microRNA profiles , indicating common changes induced by distinct quiescence signals .	evading growth suppressors
23259597_s4	By analyzing the gene expression patterns of microRNA target genes with quiescence , we discovered a strong regulatory function for miR-29 , which is downregulated with quiescence .	
23259597_s5	Using microarrays and immunoblotting , we confirmed that miR-29 targets genes encoding collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins and that those target genes are induced in quiescence .	
23259597_s6	In addition , overexpression of miR-29 resulted in more rapid cell cycle re-entry from quiescence .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23259597_s7	We also found that let-7 and miR-125 were upregulated in quiescent cells .	
23259597_s8	Overexpression of either one alone resulted in slower cell cycle re-entry from quiescence , while the combination of both together slowed cell cycle re-entry even further .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23259597_s9	CONCLUSIONS : microRNAs regulate key aspects of fibroblast quiescence including the proliferative state of the cells as well as their gene expression profiles , in particular , the induction of extracellular matrix proteins in quiescent fibroblasts .	
23261429_s0	High-grade prostate cancers express high levels of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , major enzymes involved in tumor invasion and metastasis .	
23261429_s1	However , the tumor cell lines commonly employed for prostate cancer research express only small amounts of MMPs when cultivated as monolayer cultures , in common culture media .	
23261429_s2	The present study was conducted to ascertain whether culture conditions that include fibronectin can alter MMP2 and MMP9 expression by the human prostatic epithelial cell lines RWPE-1 , LNCaP and PC-3 .	
23261429_s3	These cells were individually seeded at 2×10(4) cells/cm(2) , cultivated until they reached 80% confluence , and then exposed for 4h to fibronectin , after which the conditioned medium was analyzed by gelatin zymography .	
23261429_s4	Untreated cells were given common medium .	
23261429_s5	Only RWPE-1 cells express detectable amounts of MMP9 when cultivated in common medium , whereas the addition of fibronectin induced high expression levels of pro and active forms of MMP2 in all tested cell lines .	
23261429_s6	Our findings demonstrate that normal and tumor prostate cell lines express MMP2 activity when in contact with extracellular matrix components or blood plasma proteins such as fibronectin .	activating invasion and metastasis
23261429_s7	Future studies of transcriptomes and proteomes in prostate cancer research using these cell lines should not neglect these important conclusions .	
23261524_s0	p53 plays an important role in regulating a wide variety of cellular processes , such as cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis .	
23261524_s1	Dysfunction of p53 is frequently associated with several pathologies , such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases .	
23261524_s2	In recent years substantial progress has been made in developing novel p53-activating molecules .	
23261524_s3	Importantly , modulation of p53 interaction with its main inhibitor , Mdm2 , has been highlighted as a promising therapy target .	
23261524_s4	In this regard , bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( BiFC ) analysis , by providing direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells , offers a straightforward method to identify potential modulators of protein interactions .	
23261524_s5	In this study , we developed a simple and robust Venus-based BiFC system to screen for modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions in live mammalian cells .	
23261524_s6	We used nutlin-3 , a well-known disruptor of p53-Mdm2 interaction , to validate the specificity of the assay .	
23261524_s7	The reduction of BiFC signal mediated by nutlin-3 was correlated with an increase in Puma transactivation , PARP cleavage , and cell death .	resisting cell death
23261524_s8	Finally , this novel BiFC approach was exploited to identify potential modulators of p53-Mdm2 complex formation among a commercially available chemical library of 33 protein phosphatase inhibitors .	
23261524_s9	Our results constitute " proof-of-concept " that this model has strong potential as an alternative to traditional target-based drug discovery strategies .	
23261524_s10	Identification of new modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions will be useful to achieve synergistic drug efficacy with currently used anti-tumor therapies .	
23261678_s0	Breast cancer constitutes a major health problem for women worldwide .	
23261678_s1	However , its incidence varies between populations and geographical locations .	
23261678_s2	These variations could be diet-related , since there are several carcinogenic compounds in the modern diet , while natural products contain various anti-cancer elements .	
23261678_s3	Several lines of evidence indicate that , in addition to their clear preventive effect , these compounds could also be used as therapeutic agents .	
23261678_s4	In the present report we have shown that oleuropein , a pharmacologically safe natural product of olive leaf , has potent anti-breast cancer properties .	
23261678_s5	Indeed , oleuropein exhibits specific cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells , with higher effect on the basal-like MDA-MB-231 cells than on the luminal MCF-7 cells .	
23261678_s6	This effect is mediated through the induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway .	resisting cell death
23261678_s7	Moreover , oleuropein inhibits cell proliferation by delaying the cell cycle at S phase and up-regulated the cyclin-dependent inhibitor p21 .	evading growth suppressors
23261678_s8	Furthermore , oleuropein inhibited the anti-apoptosis and pro-proliferation protein NF-ÎºB and its main oncogenic target cyclin D1 .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23261678_s9	This inhibition could explain the great effect of oleuropein on cell proliferation and cell death of breast cancer cells .	
23261678_s10	Therefore , oleuropein warrants further investigations to prove its utility in preventing/treating breast cancer , especially the less-responsive basal-like type .	
23263160_s0	PURPOSE : Acid ceramidase ( AC ) occupies an important place in the control of cancer cell proliferation .	
23263160_s1	We tested the influence of AC inhibition on the effects of PSC 833 , a P-glycoprotein antagonist with potent ceramide-generating capacity , to determine whether AC could be a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer .	
23263160_s2	METHODS : Ceramide metabolism was followed using ( 3)H-palmitate , and molecular species were determined by mass spectroscopy .	
23263160_s3	Apoptosis was measured by DNA fragmentation , autophagy by acridine orange staining , and cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry and RB phosphorylation .	
23263160_s4	AC was measured in intact cells using fluorescent substrate .	
23263160_s5	RESULTS : Exposure of human PANC-1 or MIA-PaCa-2 cells to PSC 833 promoted increases in de novo ( dihydro)ceramides , ( dihydro)glucosylceramides , and ( dihydro)sphingomyelins , demarking ceramide generation and robust metabolism .	
23263160_s6	Despite the multifold increases in ( dihydro)ceramide levels , cells were refractory to PSC 833 .	
23263160_s7	However , PSC 833 produced a dose-dependent decrease in DNA synthesis and dose- and time-dependent decreases in RB phosphorylation , consistent with cell cycle arrest as demonstrated at G1 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23263160_s8	Cytostatic effects of PSC 833 were converted to cytotoxic end-point by acid ceramidase inhibition .	
23263160_s9	Cytotoxicity was accompanied by formation of acridine orange-stained acidic vesicles and an increase in LC3 expression , indicative of autophagic response .	resisting cell death
23263160_s10	Cell death was not reversed by preexposure to myriocin , which blocks PSC 833-induced ceramide generation .	
23263160_s11	CONCLUSION : Although the role of ceramide in end-point cytotoxicity is unclear , our results suggest that acid ceramidase is a viable target in pancreatic cancer .	
23263160_s12	We propose that AC inhibition will be effective in concert with other anticancer therapies .	
23263186_s0	Epirubicin was developed as a semi-synthetic anthracycline derivative to circumvent the cardiotoxic limitations associated with the use of doxorubicin in the clinic .	
23263186_s1	Anthracycline compounds have been demonstrated to form covalent drug-DNA adducts utilising endogenous and exogenous sources of formaldehyde ; however , previous investigations of the formation of epirubicin-DNA adducts provide conflicting evidence for adduct formation .	
23263186_s2	This work provides evidence that epirubicin acts to form drug-DNA adducts at physiologically relevant concentrations and demonstrates that the rate of formation of epirubicin-DNA adducts is slower than that observed for other anthracycline compounds , explaining why they are only detectable under defined experimental conditions .	genomic instability and mutation
23263186_s3	Formation of covalent epirubicin-DNA adducts improves the apoptotic profile of epirubicin and provides opportunities to overcome drug resistance and cardiotoxic limitations .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
23263278_s0	The mechanisms by which tumour cells metastasize and the role that cell polarity proteins play in this process are not well understood .	
23263278_s1	We report that partitioning defective protein 3 ( Par3 ) is dysregulated in metastasis in human breast cancer , and is associated with a higher tumour grade and ErbB2-positive status .	activating invasion and metastasis
23263278_s2	Downregulation of Par3 cooperated with ErbB2 to induce cell invasion and metastasis in vivo .	activating invasion and metastasis
23263278_s3	Interestingly , the metastatic behaviour was not associated with an overt mesenchymal phenotype .	activating invasion and metastasis
23263278_s4	However , loss of Par3 inhibited E-cadherin junction stability , disrupted membrane and actin dynamics at cell-cell junctions and decreased cell-cell cohesion in a manner dependent on the Tiam1/Rac-GTP pathway .	
23263278_s5	Inhibition of this pathway restored E-cadherin junction stability and blocked invasive behaviour of cells lacking Par3 , suggesting that loss of Par3 promotes metastatic behaviour of ErbB2-induced tumour epithelial cells by decreasing cell-cell cohesion .	activating invasion and metastasis
23264205_s0	BACKGROUND : CD81 is a transmembrane protein that serves as a putative receptor for hepatitis C virus .	
23264205_s1	In addition , CD81 has been suggested to be involved in a broad range of other cellular functions .	
23264205_s2	Its putative implication in tumorigenesis has so far , however , remained largely unexplored .	
23264205_s3	To assess the candidacy of CD81 as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer development , we investigated its expression and function in a series of primary gastric tumors and gastric tumor-derived cell lines .	
23264205_s4	METHODS : The expression and concomitant methylation status of the CD81 gene and its effect on tumor development and cellular signaling were evaluated .	
23264205_s5	RESULTS : CD81 mRNA levels were found to be low in 16 of 40 ( 40% ) primary tumors and 9 of 14 ( 64.2% ) cell lines , and these low expression levels were found to correlate with the stage and grade of the tumors .	
23264205_s6	Genomic alterations of CD81 were not encountered , whereas its expression could be re-activated in low expressing cells upon 5-aza-dC treatment .	
23264205_s7	Bisulfite DNA sequencing analysis of 10 CpG sites within the 5 ' proximal region of the CD81 gene promoter revealed that the observed transcriptional silencing was tightly associated with aberrant hypermethylation .	
23264205_s8	Subsequent restoration of CD81 expression induced a G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , whereas siRNA-mediated CD81 down-regulation promoted cell proliferation and attenuated cellular responses to various apoptotic stress stimuli .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23264205_s9	Also the colony-forming ability of the tumor cells could be inhibited and enhanced through CD81 up- and down-regulation , respectively .	
23264205_s10	CD81 was found to inhibit p38 ( but not ERK , JNK and AKT ) phosphorylation and its growth suppressive effect could be abolished through p38 up- and down-regulation .	
23264205_s11	CONCLUSION : From our data we conclude that epigenetic inactivation of CD81 is a common feature of gastric tumors and that this inactivation may render growth and survival advantages to the tumor cells , at least partially through p38 signaling .	
23264221_s0	Pterostilbene , a polyphenolic compound present in grapes and other fruits , has been demonstrated to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis and autophagy in some cancer cell types .	
23264221_s1	We found that pterostilbene at the IC90 concentration of 44 ï¿½M inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in MOLT4 human leukemia cells .	resisting cell death
23264221_s2	Treatment with pterostilbene resulted in a transient accumulation of cells in the G0/G1-cell cycle phase followed by the S-phase arrest .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23264221_s3	Pterostilbene-induced apoptotic death of MOLT4 cells was mediated by caspase-3 activation and was accompanied by the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential , phosphatidylserine externalization and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation .	resisting cell death
23264221_s4	Our results suggest that pterostilbene could serve as a potential additional chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemia .	
23264393_s0	Context:The ubiquitin-proteasome system and macroautophagy are two major pathways for intracellular protein degradation .	
23264393_s1	Emerging lines of evidence have shown that blockade of ubiquitin-proteasome system by proteasome inhibitors activates macroautophagy.Objective:The purpose of this study was to determine the involvement of autophagy essential gene Beclin 1 in cytotoxicity of thyroid cancer cells mediated by proteasome inhibitors.Design:Autophagy was measured by acidic-trophic dye staining and EGF-LC3 distribution using fluorescence microscopy , as well as LC3-II transition using Western blot .	
23264393_s2	To ascertain the effect of Beclin 1 , cells were transfected with Beclin 1 plasmid or shRNA against Beclin 1 .	
23264393_s3	Cell viability and apoptotic cells were measured using MTT assay and flow cytometry , respectively.Results:Proteasome inhibitors decreased Beclin 1 expression .	
23264393_s4	In addition , treatment with PI3K inhibitors 3-MA or wortmannin , as well as knockdown of Beclin 1 expression , was unable to affect autophagic responses mediated by proteasome inhibitors .	resisting cell death
23264393_s5	Overexpression of Beclin 1 enhanced proteasome inhibitor-mediated cytotoxicity of thyroid cancer cells via suppression of survivin.Conclusions:Proteasome inhibitors cause Beclin 1-independent macroautophagic responses of thyroid cancer cells in a Beclin 1-independent manner .	
23264393_s6	Beclin 1 possesses autophagy-independent antitumoral effects upon exposure of thyroid cancer cells to proteasome inhibitors .	resisting cell death
23264851_s0	Kaposi sarcoma is the most common neoplasm caused by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) .	
23264851_s1	It is prevalent among the elderly in the Mediterranean , inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa , and immunocompromised individuals such as organ transplant recipients and AIDS patients .	
23264851_s2	Current treatments for Kaposi sarcoma can inhibit tumor growth but are not able to eliminate KSHV from the host .	
23264851_s3	When the host's immune system weakens , KSHV begins to replicate again , and active tumor growth ensues .	
23264851_s4	New therapeutic approaches are needed .	
23264851_s5	Cannabidiol ( CBD ) , a plant-derived cannabinoid , exhibits promising antitumor effects without inducing psychoactive side effects .	
23264851_s6	CBD is emerging as a novel therapeutic for various disorders , including cancer .	
23264851_s7	In this study , we investigated the effects of CBD both on the infection of endothelial cells ( ECs ) by KSHV and on the growth and apoptosis of KSHV-infected ECs , an in vitro model for the transformation of normal endothelium to Kaposi sarcoma .	
23264851_s8	While CBD did not affect the efficiency with which KSHV infected ECs , it reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in those infected by the virus .	resisting cell death
23264851_s9	CBD inhibited the expression of KSHV viral G protein-coupled receptor ( vGPCR ) , its agonist , the chemokine growth-regulated protein Î± ( GRO-Î± ) , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 ( VEGFR-3 ) , and the VEGFR-3 ligand , vascular endothelial growth factor C ( VEGF-C ) .	inducing angiogenesis
23264851_s10	This suggests a potential mechanism by which CBD exerts its effects on KSHV-infected endothelium and supports the further examination of CBD as a novel targeted agent for the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma .	
23266715_s0	A predictive mathematical model of the transition from the G2 phase in the cell cycle to mitosis ( M ) was constructed from the known interactions of the proteins that are thought to play significant roles in the G2 to M transition as well as the DNA damage- induced G2 checkpoint .	
23266715_s1	The model simulates the accumulation of active cyclin B1/Cdk1 ( MPF ) complexes in the nucleus to activate mitosis , the inhibition of this process by DNA damage , and transport of component proteins between cytoplasm and nucleus .	
23266715_s2	Interactions in the model are based on activities of individual phospho-epitopes and binding sites of proteins involved in G2/M .	
23266715_s3	Because tracking phosphoforms leads to combinatorial explosion , we employ a rule-based approach using the BioNetGen software .	
23266715_s4	The model was used to determine the effects of depletion or over-expression of selected proteins involved in the regulation of the G2 to M transition in the presence and absence of DNA damage .	
23266715_s5	Depletion of Plk1 delayed mitotic entry and recovery from the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest and over-expression of MPF attenuated the DNA damage-induced G2 delay .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
23266715_s6	The model recapitulates the G2 delay observed in the biological response to varying levels of a DNA damage signal .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
23266715_s7	The model produced the novel prediction that depletion of pkMyt1 results in an abnormal biological state in which G2 cells with DNA damage accumulate inactive nuclear MPF .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
23266715_s8	Such a detailed model may prove useful for predicting DNA damage G2 checkpoint function in cancer and , therefore , sensitivity to cancer therapy .	evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
23266736_s0	Î³-Tocotrienol and sesamin are phytochemicals that display potent anticancer activity .	
23266736_s1	Since sesamin inhibits the metabolic degradation of tocotrienols , studies were conducted to determine if combined treatment with sesamin potentiates the antiproliferative effects of Î³-tocotrienol on neoplastic mouse ( +SA ) and human ( MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 ) mammary cancer cells .	
23266736_s2	Results showed that treatment with Î³-tocotrienol or sesamin alone induced a significant dose-responsive growth inhibition , whereas combination treatment with these agents synergistically inhibited the growth of +SA , MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 mammary cancer cells , while similar treatment doses were found to have little or no effect on normal ( mouse CL-S1 and human MCF-10A ) mammary epithelial cell growth or viability .	
23266736_s3	However , sesamin synergistic enhancement of Î³-tocotrienol-induced anticancer effects was not found to be mediated from a reduction in Î³-tocotrienol metabolism .	
23266736_s4	Rather , combined treatment with subeffective doses of Î³-tocotrienol and sesamin was found to induce G1 cell cycle arrest , and a corresponding decrease in cyclin D1 , CDK2 , CDK4 , CDK6 , phospho-Rb , and E2F1 levels , and increase in p27 and p16 levels .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23266736_s5	Additional studies showed that the antiproliferative effect of combination treatment did not initiate apoptosis or result in a decrease in mammary cancer cell viability .	resisting cell death
23266736_s6	Taken together , these findings indicate that the synergistic antiproliferative action of combined Î³-tocotrienol and sesamin treatment in mouse and human mammary cancer cells is cytostatic , not cytotoxic , and results from G1 cell cycle arrest .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23266739_s0	Bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) , used to treat severe hematological malignancies , often leads to potentially fatal acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , despite attempts for better matching and/or use of immune suppressive agents .	
23266739_s1	We reported that embryo-derived PreImplantation-Factor plays a determining role in developing maternal/host tolerance towards the semi/allogenic embryo and regulating systemic immune response .	
23266739_s2	Synthetic PIF ( PIF ) treatment is effective preventing immune attack in non-pregnant models of autoimmunity .	
23266739_s3	Herein , we test PIF ability to prevent acute GVHD development in semi or totally allogenic murine models .	
23266739_s4	We examine PIF's regulatory effect in vivo and in vitro , to control deleterious GVHD while maintaining its ability to preserve beneficial graft vs. leukemia ( GVL effect ) .	
23266739_s5	Bone marrow and spleen cells from C57BL/6 donors were transplanted to semi-allogenic ( C57BL/6ï¿½BALB/c ) F1 or allogenic ( BALB/c ) recipients , and then treated with PIF1mg/kg/day/2weeks .	
23266739_s6	Short-term PIF administration reduced acute GVHD in both models and increased survival for up to four months after semi-(or totally ) allogenic BMT .	
23266739_s7	The obtained effect was coupled with lessened skin ( semi-allogenic ) and decreased liver inflammation ( both models ) as well as reduced colon ulceration ( allogenic ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
23266739_s8	Both GVHD associated cytokines and chemokines gene expression were decreased in the liver .	
23266739_s9	PIF further lowered circulating interleukin-17 , but not interferon-Î³ levels .	
23266739_s10	PIF treatment was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro to lead to decreased iNOS expression and in LPS-activated macrophages to lower nitric oxide secretion .	
23266739_s11	Significantly , PIF did not impair the beneficial GVL effect in the B-cell leukemia model .	
23266739_s12	PIF primarily acts by inducing regulatory phenotype on monocytes/APC , which controls T-cell proliferation .	
23266739_s13	Overall our data demonstrates that PIF protects against semi/allogenic GVHD long-term by reducing both target organ and systemic inflammation and by lowering oxidative stress , all while preserving the beneficial GVL effect .	tumor promoting inflammation
23266941_s0	There are many growth factors influencing the expansion of multiple myeloma ( MM ) .	
23266941_s1	Angiogenesis is a process that may enhance MM growth , in various manners .	
23266941_s2	Among them , insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) is a major factor , acting in many levels .	
23266941_s3	The aim of the study was to measure serum levels of IGF-1 in newly diagnosed MM patients and to correlate them with clinical stage of the disease and with markers of angiogenesis , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , and interleukin-6 and 15 ( IL-6 and IL-15 ) .	
23266941_s4	Serum levels of the above factors were measured , by ELISA , in 57 newly diagnosed MM patients and in 20 healthy controls .	
23266941_s5	There was no difference in serum levels of IGF-1 in MM patients and in controls , contrary to angiogenic factors , which were higher in MM patients ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
23266941_s6	Similarly , IGF-1 did not correlate with clinical stage of the disease nor the other angiogenic factors , which also correlated with each other ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
23266941_s7	Serum IGF-1 concentrations are not influenced in MM patients .	
23266941_s8	Therefore , although it is a proliferation cytokine , it cannot be used as marker of disease activity .	
23266955_s0	DNA damage signaling and repair take place in a chromatin context .	
23266955_s1	Consequently , chromatin-modifying enzymes , including adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes , play an important role in the management of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) .	
23266955_s2	Here , we show that the p400 ATPase is required for DNA repair by homologous recombination ( HR ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23266955_s3	Indeed , although p400 is not required for DNA damage signaling , DNA DSB repair is defective in the absence of p400 .	genomic instability and mutation
23266955_s4	We demonstrate that p400 is important for HR-dependent processes , such as recruitment of Rad51 to DSB ( a key component of HR ) , homology-directed repair , and survival after DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
23266955_s5	Strikingly , p400 and Rad51 are present in the same complex and both favor chromatin remodeling around DSBs .	genomic instability and mutation
23266955_s6	Altogether , our data provide a direct molecular link between Rad51 and a chromatin remodeling enzyme involved in chromatin decompaction around DNA DSBs .	genomic instability and mutation
23267699_s0	ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : Survivin , a member of the family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins , functions as a key regulator of mitosis and programmed cell death .	
23267699_s1	YM155 , a novel molecular targeted agent , suppresses survivin , which is overexpressed in many tumor types .	
23267699_s2	The aim of this study was to determine the antitumor activity of YM155 in SK-NEP-1 cells .	
23267699_s3	METHODS : SK-NEP-1 cell growth in vitro and in vivo was assessed by MTT and nude mice experiments .	
23267699_s4	Annexin V/propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometric analysis was used to detect apoptosis in cell culture .	
23267699_s5	Then gene expression profile of tumor cells treated with YM155 was analyzed with real-time PCR arrays .	
23267699_s6	We then analyzed the expression data with MEV ( Multi Experiment View ) cluster software .	
23267699_s7	Datasets representing genes with altered expression profile derived from cluster analyses were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool .	
23267699_s8	RESULTS : YM155 treatment resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1cells in a dose-dependent manner .	
23267699_s9	Annexin V assay , cell cycle , and activation of caspase-3 demonstrates that YM155 induced apoptosis in SK-NEP-1 cells .	resisting cell death
23267699_s10	YM155 significantly inhibited growth of SK-NEP-1 xenografts ( YM155 5 mg/kg : 1.45 +/- 0.77 cm3 ; YM155 10 mg/kg : 0.95 +/- 0.55 cm3 ) compared to DMSO group ( DMSO : 3.70 +/- 2.4 cm3 ) or PBS group cells ( PBS : 3.78 +/- 2.20 cm3 , ANOVA P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	
23267699_s11	YM155 treatment decreased weight of tumors ( YM155 5 mg/kg : 1.05 +/- 0.24 g ; YM155 10 mg/kg : 0.72 +/- 0.17 g ) compared to DMSO group ( DMSO : 2.06 +/- 0.38 g ) or PBS group cells ( PBS : 2.36 +/- 0.43 g , ANOVA P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	
23267699_s12	Real-time PCR array analysis showed between Test group and control group there are 32 genes significantly up-regulated and 54 genes were significantly down-regulated after YM155 treatment .	
23267699_s13	Ingenuity pathway analysis ( IPA ) showed cell death was the highest rated network with 65 focus molecules and the significance score of 44 .	
23267699_s14	The IPA analysis also groups the differentially expressed genes into biological mechanisms that are related to cell death , cellular function maintenance , cell morphology , carbohydrate metabolism and cellular growth and proliferation .	
23267699_s15	Death receptor signaling ( 3.87E-19 ) , TNFR1 signaling , induction of apoptosis by HIV1 , apoptosis signaling and molecular mechanisms of cancer came out to be the top four most significant pathways .	resisting cell death
23267699_s16	IPA analysis also showed top molecules up-regulated were BBC3 , BIRC3 , BIRC8 , BNIP1 , CASP7 , CASP9 , CD5 , CDKN1A , CEBPG and COL4A3 , top molecules down-regulated were ZNF443 , UTP11L , TP73 , TNFSF10 , TNFRSF1B , TNFRSF25 , TIAF1 , STK17A , SST and SPP1 , upstream regulator were NR3C1 , TP53 , dexamethasone , TNF and Akt .	
23267699_s17	CONCLUSIONS : The present study demonstrates that YM155 treatment resulted in apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation of SK-NEP-1cells .	resisting cell death
23267699_s18	YM155 had significant role and little side effect in the treatment of SK-NEP-1 xenograft tumors .	
23267699_s19	Real-time PCR array analysis firstly showed expression profile of genes dyes-regulated after YM155 treatment .	
23267699_s20	IPA analysis also represents new molecule mechanism of YM155 treatment , such as NR3C1 and dexamethasone may be new target of YM155 .	
23267699_s21	And our results may provide new clues of molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by YM155 .	resisting cell death
23268075_s0	We report a case of recurrent gastric cancer successfully treated by a combination of CPT-11 and CDDP as the third- line chemotherapy .	
23268075_s1	A 78-year-old man with advanced gastric cancer underwent a curative distal gastrectomy .	
23268075_s2	Three years later , the tumor marker level began to rise and computed tomography ( CT ) revealed lymph node metastasis invading the pancreas resulting in pancreatic duct dilatation .	activating invasion and metastasis
23268075_s3	S-1 treatment was initiated but was discontinued because of a systemic exanthem .	
23268075_s4	Paclitaxel was administrated as secondary chemotherapy .	
23268075_s5	But , after 2 courses , a further increase in the tumor marker level and portal vein invasion were observed .	
23268075_s6	Combination therapy of CPT-11 and CDDP was administered as the third-line chemotherapy .	
23268075_s7	After 3 courses , the tumor marker level normalized , tumor size decreased , and the invasion was eliminated .	activating invasion and metastasis
23268075_s8	Third-line chemotherapy against recurrent gastric cancer should be considered if patient performance status ( PS ) is maintained .	
23268564_s0	Vaccination is , in theory , a safe and effective approach for controlling disseminated or metastatic cancer due to the specificity of the mammalian immune system , yet its success in the clinic has been hampered thus far by the problem of immune tolerance to tumor self-antigen .	
23268564_s1	Here we describe a DNA vaccination strategy that is able to control cancer by overcoming immune tolerance to tumor self-antigen .	
23268564_s2	We engineered a DNA construct encoding a dimeric form of a secreted single chain trimer of major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain , Î²2-microglobulin , and peptide antigen linked to immunoglobulin G ( SCT-Ag/IgG ) .	
23268564_s3	The chimeric protein was able to bind to antigen-specific CD8+ T cells with nearly 100% efficiency and strongly induce their activation and proliferation .	avoiding immune destruction
23268564_s4	In addition , the chimeric protein was able to coat professional antigen-presenting cells through the Fc receptor to activate antigen-specific CD8+ T cells .	
23268564_s5	Furthermore , intradermal vaccination with DNA encoding SCT-Ag/IgG could generate significant numbers of cytotoxic effector T cells against tumor self-antigen and leads to successful therapeutic outcomes in a preclinical model of metastatic melanoma .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
23268564_s6	Our data suggest that the DNA vaccine strategy described in the current study is able to break immune tolerance against endogenous antigen and result in potent therapeutic antitumor effects .	
23268564_s7	Such strategy may be used in other antigenic systems for the control of infections and/or cancers .	
23268708_s0	Abstract Purpose : Cell death is one of the most important endpoints of radiosensitivity .	
23268708_s1	The tumor suppressor p53 participates not only in regulation of apoptosis , but also in autophagy mechanism .	
23268708_s2	In this study , H1299-P53 ( with wild-type p53 ) and H1299-175H ( with mutant 175H ) were used , and the effects of p53 on radiosensitivity were analyzed .	
23268708_s3	Methods : Cell models with different p53 status were established by gene engineering , and cell viability was examined by colony formation assay , and cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8 ) , 3-Methyladenine , and Z-VAD were used to block autophagy and apoptosis , respectively .	
23268708_s4	Western blot was used to detect protein expression ; monodansylcadaverine ( MDC ) staining was used to analyze autophagy rate ; DAPI/Propidium Iodide ( PI ) staining and flow cytometry were used to assess apoptosis and necrosis .	
23268708_s5	Results : In parental H1299 , H1299-P53 , and H1299-175H cells , radiosensitivity exhibited different by colony formation and CCK-8 assay ( D0 : 1.764 Gy , 1.407 Gy and 1.695 Gy ; Dq : 2.977 Gy , 1.199 Gy and 2.312 Gy in turn ) .	
23268708_s6	The radiosensitization of p53 was associated with the increase of MDM2 and P21 expression .	
23268708_s7	The ionizing radiation ( IR)-induced apoptosis was significant in H1299-P53 compared with in H1299 and H199-175H ( p&lt;0.05 ) by flow cytometry , and the expression of cleaved-caspase3 was increased in H1299-P53 cells .	resisting cell death
23268708_s8	While the IR-induced autophagy was significant in H1299 cells ( p&lt;0.01 ) and decreased in H1299-P53 and H1299-175H cells ( p&lt;0.01 ) by MDC staining , the expression of MAPLC3II and Beclin-1 increased in H1299 , but not in H1299-p53 and H199-175H cells .	resisting cell death
23268708_s9	The IR-induced cell survival was significantly increased by Z-VAD-FMK and decreased by 3MA in H1299-P53 cells ; IR- induced autophagy was significantly increased by Z-VAD-FMK in H1299-P53 cells ( p&lt;0.01 ) , but not changed in H1299 cells .	resisting cell death
23268708_s10	Conclusion : p53 could regulate radiosensitivity by inhibiting autophagy and activating apoptosis ; autophagy provides a prosurvival mechanism , and p53 potently abrogated the IR-induced autophagy , while mutant 175H shown no effect on radiosensitivity , suggesting that individual treatment strategies should be based on p53 status in patients .	resisting cell death
23269235_s0	Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity that mainly targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors , and recently , it has been shown to be an active agent for the treatment of malignant pheochromocytomas .	
23269235_s1	Previously , we demonstrated that sunitinib directly inhibited mTORC1 signaling in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells .	
23269235_s2	Although autophagy is a highly regulated cellular process , its relevance to cancer seems to be complicated .	
23269235_s3	It is of note that inhibition of mTORC1 is a prerequisite for autophagy induction .	
23269235_s4	Indeed , direct mTORC1 inhibition initiates ULK1/2 autophosphorylation and subsequent Atg13 and FIP200 phosphorylation , inducing autophagy .	
23269235_s5	Here , we demonstrated that sunitinib significantly increased the levels of LC3-II , concomitant with a decrease of p62 in PC12 cells .	
23269235_s6	Following sunitinib treatment , immunofluorescent imaging revealed a marked increased punctate LC3-II distribution .	
23269235_s7	Furthermore , Atg13 knockdown significantly reduced its protein level , which in turn abolished sunitinib-induced autophagy .	resisting cell death
23269235_s8	Moreover , inhibition of autophagy by siRNAs targeting Atg13 or by pharmacological inhibition with ammonium chloride , enhanced both sunitinib-induced apoptosis and anti-proliferation .	resisting cell death
23269235_s9	Thus , sunitinib-induced autophagy is dependent on the suppression of mTORC1 signaling and the formation of ULK1/2-Atg13-FIP200 complexes .	resisting cell death
23269235_s10	Inhibition of autophagy may be a promising therapeutic option for improving the anti-tumor effect of sunitinib .	resisting cell death
23270461_s0	ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : The ubiquitin-proteasome system and macroautophagy ( hereafter referred to autophagy ) are two complementary pathways for protein degradation .	
23270461_s1	Emerging evidence suggests that proteasome inhibition might be a promising approach for tumor therapy .	
23270461_s2	Accumulating data suggest that autophagy is activated as a compensatory mechanism upon proteasome activity is impaired .	
23270461_s3	METHOD : Autophagy activation was measured using acridine orange staining and LC3 transition .	
23270461_s4	Cell viability and apoptosis were measured using MTT assay and flow cytometry , respectively .	
23270461_s5	Beclin 1 expression vectors or shRNA against Beclin 1 ( shBeclin 1 ) were transfected to investigate the role of Beclin 1 in autophagy activation and cytotoxicity of ovarian cancer cells induced by proteasome inhibitors .	
23270461_s6	RESULTS : Proteasome inhibitors suppressed proliferation and induced autophagy in ovarian cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23270461_s7	Neither phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitors nor shRNA against Beclin 1 could abolish the formation of acidic vacuoles and the processing of LC3 induced by proteasome inhibitors .	
23270461_s8	Moreover , Beclin 1 overexpression enhanced anti-proliferative effects of proteasome inhibitors in ovarian cancer cells .	
23270461_s9	CONCLUSIONS : For the first time , the current study demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors induced PI3K and Beclin 1-independent autophagy in ovarian cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23270461_s10	In addition , this study revealed autophagy-independent tumor suppressive effects of Beclin 1 in ovarian cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23270478_s0	Recently , our group reported the discovery of three new withanolides , physangulidines A-C , from Physalis angulata .	
23270478_s1	In this study , the biological effects of physangulidine A ( 1 ) , which was the most active and abundant of the three new constituents , are described .	
23270478_s2	It was found that 1 significantly reduces survival in clonogenic assays for two hormone-independent prostate cancer cell lines .	
23270478_s3	Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies in DU145 human prostate cancer cells indicated that 1 induces cell cycle arrest in the G(2)/M phase and causes defective mitosis .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23270478_s4	It was determined also that 1 produces programed cell death by apoptosis , as evidenced by biochemical markers and distinct changes in cell morphology .	resisting cell death
23270478_s5	These results imply that the antimitotic and proapoptotic effects of 1 may contribute significantly to the biological activities and potential medicinal properties of its plant of origin .	
23270728_s0	The evidence that androgen blockade-resistant prostate cancer , termed castration resistant , remains androgen receptor ( AR ) dependent is compelling .	
23270728_s1	AR is re-activated through multiple mechanisms including expression of constitutively active splice variants that lack hormone binding domains ( HBDs ) .	
23270728_s2	This highlights need to develop therapies that target regions other than the HBD .	
23270728_s3	Because the p160 coactivators interact most strongly with the amino-terminus of AR , we examined the consequences of disrupting this interaction .	
23270728_s4	We identified two overlapping SRC-1 peptides that interact with AR , but not with progesterone receptor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23270728_s5	These peptides reduce AR and AR variant AR-V7 dependent induction of an AR responsive reporter .	
23270728_s6	Using mammalian two hybrid assays , we found that the peptides interrupt the AR/SRC-1 , AR/SRC-2 and AR N/C interactions , but not SRC-1/CARM-1 interactions .	
23270728_s7	Consistent with the SRC-1 dependence of induced , but not repressed genes , in LNCaP cells , the peptides inhibited hormone dependent induction of endogenous target genes including PSA and TMPRSS2 , but did not block AR dependent repression of UGT2B17 or inhibit vitamin D receptor activity .	
23270728_s8	Simultaneous detection of SRC-1 peptides and PSA by double immunofluorescence in transfected LNCaP cells clearly demonstrated a strong reduction in PSA levels in cells expressing the peptides .	
23270728_s9	The peptides also inhibited the AR dependent expression of PSA in castration resistant C4-2 cells .	
23270728_s10	Moreover they inhibited androgen dependent proliferation of LNCaP cells and proliferation of C4-2 cells in androgen depleted medium without affecting AR negative PC-3 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23270728_s11	Thus , the p160 coactivator binding site is a novel potential therapeutic target to inhibit AR activity .	
23270833_s0	AIM : To explore the inhibitory effect of sulfated polysaccharide from Masson pine ( Pinus massoniana ) pollen ( SPPM60 ) on G(2)/M phase of human liver cancer HepG2 cells and its mechanism .	
23270833_s1	METHODS : The proliferation rate of HepG2 cells was evaluated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) colorimetric assay .	
23270833_s2	The cycles of HepG2 cells were measured by flow cytometry when 200Î¼g/ml concentration of SPPM60 was adopted , the expression of the genes related to cell cycle was detected by real-time PCR .	
23270833_s3	RESULTS : SPPM60 inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells and the inhibition rate was elevated with increase of SPPM60 concentration .	
23270833_s4	After treatment with 200Î¼g/ml of SPPM60 , the percentage of S phase cells was decreased , but that of G(2)/M phase was significantly increased ( 72h vs control : 32.96ï¿½0.33% vs 18.59ï¿½0.04% , 3.44ï¿½0.05% vs 18.30ï¿½0.08% , P&lt;0.01 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23270833_s5	The results of real-time PCR showed that SPPM60 could down-regulate the mRNA levels of CDK1 and CyclinB ( P&lt;0.01 ) , and up-regulate the expression of p53 and p21 ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	
23270833_s6	CONCLUSION : SPPM60 causes arrest of HepG2 cells at G(2)/M phase , and the mechanism is related to the down-regulation of CDK1 and CyclinB and up-regulation of p53 and p21 expression .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23270926_s0	MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are involved in cancer development and progression , acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes .	
23270926_s1	In this study , miRNA profiling was performed on 10 paired bladder cancer ( BC ) tissues using 20 GeneChipTM miRNA Array , and 10 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in BC and adjacent noncancerous tissues of any disease stage/grade .	
23270926_s2	After validated on expanded cohort of 67 paired BC tissues and 10 human BC cell lines by qRT-PCR , it was found that miR-100 was down-regulated most significantly in cancer tissues .	
23270926_s3	Ectopic restoration of miR-100 expression in BC cells suppressed cell proliferation and motility , induced cell-cycle arrest in vitro , and inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo both in subcutaneous and intravesical passage .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23270926_s4	Bioinformatic analysis showed that mTOR gene was a direct target of miR-100. siRNA-mediated mTOR knockdown phenocopied the effect of miR-100 in BC cell lines .	
23270926_s5	In addition , the cancerous metastatic nude mouse model established on the basis of primary BC cell lines suggested that miR-100/mTOR regulated cell motility and was associated with tumor metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
23270926_s6	Both mTOR and p70S6K ( downstream messenger ) presented higher expression levels in distant metastatic foci such as in liver and kidney metastases than in primary tumor .	activating invasion and metastasis
23270926_s7	Taken together , miR-100 may act as a tumor suppressor in BC , and reintroduction of this mature miRNA into tumor tissue may prove to be a therapeutic strategy by reducing the expression of target genes .	
23270927_s0	Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) is a fatal pediatric disease .	
23270927_s1	Thus far no therapeutic agent has proven beneficial in the treatment of this malignancy .	
23270927_s2	Hence , conventional DNA-damaging radiotherapy ( RT ) remains the standard treatment , providing transient neurological improvement without improving probability of overall survival .	
23270927_s3	During RT , WEE1 kinase controls the G2 cell cycle checkpoint allowing for repair of irradiation ( IR)-induced DNA damage .	
23270927_s4	Here we show that WEE1 kinase is one of the highest overexpressed kinases in primary DIPG tissues as compared to matching non-neoplastic brain tissues .	
23270927_s5	Inhibition of WEE1 by MK-1775 treatment of DIPG cells inhibited the IR-induced WEE1-mediated phosphorylation of CDC2 , resulting in reduced G2/M arrest and decreased cell viability .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23270927_s6	Finally , we demonstrate that MK-1775 enhances the radiation response of E98-Fluc-mCherry DIPG mouse xenografts .	
23270927_s7	Altogether , these results show that inhibition of WEE1 kinase in conjunction with RT holds potential as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of DIPG .	
23271397_s0	OBJECTIVES : Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for pancreatic cancer ( PaCa ) .	
23271397_s1	However , the mechanisms of smoking-induced PaCa remain unknown .	
23271397_s2	Here we investigated the effect of smoking compounds on cell death pathways in pancreatic ductal cells , precursors of PaCa .	
23271397_s3	METHODS : Human pancreatic ductal cells ( HPDE6-c7 ) were cultured with cigarette smoke extract ( CSE ) or smoking compound 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone ( NNK ) .	
23271397_s4	Apoptosis and autophagy were assessed by DNA fragmentation and immunofluorescence , respectively .	
23271397_s5	RESULTS : Exposure to CSE or NNK decreased DNA fragmentation and up-regulated BclXL .	
23271397_s6	Akt kinase was activated by smoking compounds through reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism .	tumor promoting inflammation
23271397_s7	Specifically , Akt activation was prevented by inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase .	
23271397_s8	Molecular or pharmacologic inhibitions of Akt prevented the antiapoptotic effect of smoking compounds .	resisting cell death
23271397_s9	Smoking compounds stimulated rapid ( 1 hour ) and transient activation of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and formation of autophagic vacuoles , indicating stimulation of autophagy .	resisting cell death
23271397_s10	Repeated exposure to CSE/NNK ( 48 hours or longer ) abolished the early activation of autophagic markers .	resisting cell death
23271397_s11	Inhibition of Akt prevented the antiautophagic effect of long exposure to smoking compounds , indicating that smoking-induced late activation of Akt prevents autophagy .	resisting cell death
23271397_s12	CONCLUSIONS : Long exposure of pancreatic ductal cells to smoking compounds inhibited apoptosis and autophagy .	resisting cell death
23271397_s13	The results revealed a central role for Akt kinase in mediating key procarcinogenic effects of smoking compounds .	
23271722_s0	Most hepatocellular carcinomas ( HCC ) develop in the context of severe liver fibrosis and cirrhosis caused by chronic liver inflammation , which also results in accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .	
23271722_s1	In this study , we examined whether the stress-activated protein kinase p38Î± ( Mapk14 ) controls ROS metabolism and development of fibrosis and cancer in mice given thioacetamide to induce chronic liver injury .	
23271722_s2	Liver-specific p38Î± ablation was found to enhance ROS accumulation , which appears to be exerted through the reduced expression of antioxidant protein HSP25 ( Hspb1 ) , a mouse homolog of HSP27 .	tumor promoting inflammation
23271722_s3	Its reexpression in p38Î±-deficient liver prevents ROS accumulation and thioacetamide-induced fibrosis. p38Î± deficiency increased expression of SOX2 , a marker for cancer stem cells and the liver oncoproteins c-Jun ( Jun ) and Gankyrin ( Psmd10 ) and led to enhanced thioacetamide-induced hepatocarcinogenesis .	
23271722_s4	The upregulation of SOX2 and c-Jun was prevented by administration of the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole .	
23271722_s5	Intriguingly , the risk of human HCC recurrence is positively correlated with ROS accumulation in liver .	tumor promoting inflammation
23271722_s6	Thus , p38Î± and its target HSP25/HSP27 appear to play a conserved and critical hepatoprotective function by curtailing ROS accumulation in liver parenchymal cells engaged in oxidative metabolism of exogenous chemicals .	tumor promoting inflammation
23271722_s7	Augmented oxidative stress of liver parenchymal cells may explain the close relationship between liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis .	tumor promoting inflammation
23271806_s0	Each year , more than 700,000 people undergo cancer surgery in the United States .	
23271806_s1	However , more than 40% of those patients develop recurrences and have a poor outcome .	
23271806_s2	Traditionally , the medical community has assumed that recurrent tumors arise from selected tumor clones that are refractory to therapy .	
23271806_s3	However , we found that tumor cells have few phenotypical differences after surgery .	
23271806_s4	Thus , we propose an alternative explanation for the resistance of recurrent tumors .	
23271806_s5	Surgery promotes inhibitory factors that allow lingering immunosuppressive cells to repopulate small pockets of residual disease quickly .	avoiding immune destruction
23271806_s6	Recurrent tumors and draining lymph nodes are infiltrated with M2 ( CD11b(+)F4/80(hi)CD206(hi) and CD11b(+)F4/80(hi)CD124(hi) ) macrophages and CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells .	
23271806_s7	This complex network of immunosuppression in the surrounding tumor microenvironment explains the resistance of tumor recurrences to conventional cancer vaccines despite small tumor size , an intact antitumor immune response , and unaltered cancer cells .	avoiding immune destruction
23271806_s8	Therapeutic strategies coupling antitumor agents with inhibition of immunosuppressive cells potentially could impact the outcomes of more than 250,000 people each year .	avoiding immune destruction
23271983_s0	Chromosomal DNA must be in single-strand form for important transactions such as replication , transcription , and recombination to occur .	
23271983_s1	The single-strand DNA ( ssDNA ) is more prone to damage than double-strand DNA ( dsDNA ) , due to greater exposure of chemically reactive moieties in the nitrogenous bases .	
23271983_s2	Thus , there can be agents that damage regions of ssDNA in vivo while being inert toward dsDNA .	
23271983_s3	To assess the potential hazard posed by such agents , we devised an ssDNA-specific mutagenesis reporter system in budding yeast .	
23271983_s4	The reporter strains bear the cdc13-1 temperature-sensitive mutation , such that shifting to 37°C results in telomere uncapping and ensuing 5 ' to 3 ' enzymatic resection .	
23271983_s5	This exposes the reporter region , containing three closely-spaced reporter genes , as a long 3 ' ssDNA overhang .	
23271983_s6	We validated the ability of the system to detect mutagenic damage within ssDNA by expressing a modified human single-strand specific cytosine deaminase , APOBEC3G .	
23271983_s7	APOBEC3G induced a high density of substitutions at cytosines in the ssDNA overhang strand , resulting in frequent , simultaneous inactivation of two reporter genes .	
23271983_s8	We then examined the mutagenicity of sulfites , a class of reactive sulfur oxides to which humans are exposed frequently via respiration and food intake .	
23271983_s9	Sulfites , at a concentration similar to that found in some foods , induced a high density of mutations , almost always as substitutions at cytosines in the ssDNA overhang strand , resulting in simultaneous inactivation of at least two reporter genes .	genomic instability and mutation
23271983_s10	Furthermore , sulfites formed a long-lived adducted 2'-deoxyuracil intermediate in DNA that was resistant to excision by uracil-DNA N-glycosylase .	genomic instability and mutation
23271983_s11	This intermediate was bypassed by error-prone translesion DNA synthesis , frequently involving Pol ζ , during repair synthesis .	genomic instability and mutation
23271983_s12	Our results suggest that sulfite-induced lesions in DNA can be particularly deleterious , since cells might not possess the means to repair or bypass such lesions accurately .	genomic instability and mutation
23272087_s0	The ATM/ATR DNA damage checkpoint functions in the maintenance of genetic stability and some missense variants of the ATM gene have been shown to confer a moderate increased risk of prostate cancer .	
23272087_s1	However , whether inactivation of this checkpoint contributes directly to prostate specific cancer predisposition is still unknown .	
23272087_s2	Here , we show that exposure of non-malignant prostate epithelial cells ( HPr-1AR ) to androgen led to activation of the ATM/ATR DNA damage response and induction of cellular senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
23272087_s3	Notably , knockdown of the ATM gene expression in HPr-1AR cells can promote androgen-induced TMPRSS2 : ERG rearrangement , a prostate-specific chromosome translocation frequently found in prostate cancer cells .	
23272087_s4	Intriguingly , unlike the non-malignant prostate epithelial cells , the ATM/ATR DNA damage checkpoint appears to be defective in prostate cancer cells , since androgen treatment only induced a partial activation of the DNA damage response .	
23272087_s5	This mechanism appears to preserve androgen induced autophosphorylation of ATM and phosphorylation of H2AX , lesion processing and repair pathway yet restrain ATM/CHK1/CHK2 and p53 signaling pathway .	genomic instability and mutation
23272087_s6	Our findings demonstrate that ATM/ATR inactivation is a crucial step in promoting androgen-induced genomic instability and prostate carcinogenesis .	
23272139_s0	Prostate cancer is the most frequent and second most lethal cancer in men in the United States .	
23272139_s1	Innate immunity and inflammation may increase the risk of prostate cancer .	
23272139_s2	To determine the role of innate immunity and inflammation in advanced prostate cancer , we investigated the association of 320 single nucleotide polymorphisms , located in 46 genes involved in this pathway , with disease risk using 494 cases with advanced disease and 536 controls from Cleveland , Ohio .	
23272139_s3	Taken together , the whole pathway was associated with advanced prostate cancer risk ( Pâ=â0.02 ) .	
23272139_s4	Two sub-pathways ( intracellular antiviral molecules and extracellular pattern recognition ) and four genes in these sub-pathways ( TLR1 , TLR6 , OAS1 , and OAS2 ) were nominally associated with advanced prostate cancer risk and harbor several SNPs nominally associated with advanced prostate cancer risk .	
23272139_s5	Our results suggest that the innate immunity and inflammation pathway may play a modest role in the etiology of advanced prostate cancer through multiple small effects .	tumor promoting inflammation
23272179_s0	Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is a major form of chronic inflammation that can frequently progress to colon cancer .	
23272179_s1	Several studies have demonstrated massive infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lamina propria and submucosa in the progression of UC-associated colon carcinogenesis .	
23272179_s2	Macrophages contribute to the development of colitis-associated colon cancer ( CAC ) .	
23272179_s3	However , the role of neutrophils is not well understood .	
23272179_s4	To better understand the involvement of tumor-associated neutrophils ( TANs ) in the regulation of CAC , we used a mouse CAC model produced by administering azoxymethane ( AOM ) , followed by repeated dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) ingestion .	
23272179_s5	This causes severe colonic inflammation and subsequent development of multiple tumors in mice colon .	
23272179_s6	We observed that colorectal mucosal inflammation became increasingly severe with AOM and DSS treatment .	tumor promoting inflammation
23272179_s7	Macrophages infiltrated the lamina propria and submucosa , together with a marked increase in neutrophil infiltration .	
23272179_s8	The chemokine CXCL2 increased in the lamina propria and submucosal regions of the colons of the treated mice , together with the infiltration of neutrophils expressing CXCR2 , a specific receptor for CXCL2 .	
23272179_s9	This process was followed by neoplastic transformation .	
23272179_s10	After AOM and DSS treatment , the mice showed enhanced production of metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 and neutrophil elastase ( NE ) , accompanied by excessive vessel generation and cell proliferation .	inducing angiogenesis
23272179_s11	Moreover , CXCL2 promoted neutrophil recruitment and induced neutrophils to express MMP-9 and NE in vitro .	
23272179_s12	Furthermore , administration of neutrophil-neutralizing antibodies after the last DSS cycle markedly reduced the number and size of tumors and decreased the expression of CXCR2 , CXCL2 , MMP-9 , and NE .	
23272179_s13	These observations indicate a crucial role for TANs in the initiation and progression of CAC and suggest that the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis might be useful in reducing the risk of UC-associated colon cancer .	
23272224_s0	Cellular senescence is considered as a tumor suppressive mechanism .	
23272224_s1	Recent evidence indicates however that senescent cells secrete various growth factors and cytokines , some of which may paradoxically promote cancer progression .	
23272224_s2	This phenomenon termed senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) must be inhibited in order for anti-proliferative agents to be effective .	
23272224_s3	The present study was designed to determine whether the Î²-catenin destruction complex ( BCDC ) , known to integrate the action of various growth factors and cytokines , would represent a suitable target to inhibit the activity of SASP components .	
23272224_s4	For this , we carried out experiments to determine the effect of drug-induced senescence on secretion of SASP , Î²-catenin transactivation , and the relationship between these processes .	enabling replicative immortality
23272224_s5	Moreover , genetic and pharmacological approaches were used to define the implication of BCDC in mediating the effects of SASP components on cell migration and resistance to drugs .	
23272224_s6	The findings indicate that drug-induced senescence was associated with expression of various Wnt ligands in addition to previously known SASP components .	enabling replicative immortality
23272224_s7	Beta catenin transactivation and expression of genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) also increased in response to drug-induced SASP .	activating invasion and metastasis
23272224_s8	These effects were prevented by Pyrvinium , a recently described activator of BCDC .	
23272224_s9	Pyrvinium also suppressed the effects of SASP on cell migration and resistance to doxorubicin .	activating invasion and metastasis
23272224_s10	Together , these findings provide insights on the potential role of BCDC in mediating the effects of drug-induced SASP on cancer cell invasion and resistance to therapy , and suggest that targeting this pathway may represent an effective approach to enhance the activity of current and prospective anti-cancer therapeutics .	activating invasion and metastasis
23273978_s0	Binding within or nearby target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival enables the p53 tumor suppressor gene to regulate their transcription and cell-cycle progression .	
23273978_s1	Using genome-wide chromatin-binding profiles , we describe binding of p53 also to regions located distantly from any known p53 target gene .	
23273978_s2	Interestingly , many of these regions possess conserved p53-binding sites and all known hallmarks of enhancer regions .	
23273978_s3	We demonstrate that these p53-bound enhancer regions ( p53BERs ) indeed contain enhancer activity and interact intrachromosomally with multiple neighboring genes to convey long-distance p53-dependent transcription regulation .	
23273978_s4	Furthermore , p53BERs produce , ina p53-dependent manner , enhancer RNAs ( eRNAs ) that are required for efficient transcriptional enhancement of interacting target genes and induction of a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest .	evading growth suppressors
23273978_s5	Thus , our results ascribe transcription enhancement activity to p53 with the capacity to regulate multiple genes from a single genomic binding site .	
23273978_s6	Moreover , eRNA production from p53BERs is required for efficient p53 transcription enhancement .	
23274058_s0	Jaceosidin , a flavonoid derived from Artemisia princeps ( Japanese mugwort ) , has been shown to inhibit the growth of several human cancer cells , However , the exact mechanism for the cytotoxic effect of jaceosidin is not completely understood .	
23274058_s1	In this study , we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the antiproliferative effect of jaceosidin in human endometrial cancer cells .	
23274058_s2	We demonstrated that jaceosidin is a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than cisplatin in human endometrial cancer cells .	
23274058_s3	In contrast , jaceosidin-induced cytotoxicity in normal endometrial cells was lower than that observed for cisplatin .	
23274058_s4	Jaceosidin induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and modulated the levels of cyclin B and p-Cdc2 in Hec1A cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23274058_s5	Knockdown of p21 using specific siRNAs partially abrogated jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition .	
23274058_s6	Additional mechanistic studies revealed that jaceosidin treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of Cdc25C and ATM-Chk1/2 .	
23274058_s7	Ku55933 , an ATM inhibitor , reversed jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition , in part .	
23274058_s8	Moreover , jaceosidin treatment resulted in phosphorylation of ERK , and pretreatment with the ERK inhibitor , PD98059 , attenuated cell growth inhibition by jaceosidin .	
23274058_s9	These data suggest that jaceosidin , isolated from Japanese mugwort , modulates the ERK/ATM/Chk1/2 pathway , leading to inactivation of the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex , followed by G2/M cell cycle arrest in endometrial cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23274086_s0	AMPK is a metabolic sensor that helps maintain cellular energy homeostasis .	
23274086_s1	Despite evidence linking AMPK with tumor suppressor functions , the role of AMPK in tumorigenesis and tumor metabolism isunknown .	
23274086_s2	Here we show that AMPK negatively regulates aerobic glycolysis ( the Warburg effect ) in cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth invivo .	cellular energetics
23274086_s3	Genetic ablation of the α1 catalytic subunit of AMPK accelerates Myc-induced lymphomagenesis .	
23274086_s4	Inactivation of AMPKα in both transformed and nontransformed cells promotes a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis , increased allocation of glucose carbon into lipids , and biomass accumulation .	cellular energetics
23274086_s5	These metabolic effects require normoxic stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α ) , as silencing HIF-1α reverses the shift to aerobic glycolysis and the biosynthetic and proliferative advantages conferred by reduced AMPKα signaling .	cellular energetics
23274086_s6	Together our findings suggest that AMPK activity opposes tumor development and that its loss fosters tumor progression in part by regulating cellular metabolic pathways that support cell growth and proliferation .	
23274302_s0	Indolylmaleimides display a broad spectrum of biological activity and offer great opportunity to influence several aspects of cell fate , as proliferation and differentiation .	
23274302_s1	In this study we describe the effect of PDA-66 , a newly synthesised indolylmaleimide , showing a strong dose dependent anti-proliferative effect on immortalised human progenitor and cancer cells .	
23274302_s2	We demonstrated a highly depolymerizing effect on in vitro tubulin assembly and conclude that PDA-66 acts as microtubule destabilising agent .	
23274302_s3	In addition we found that PDA-66 induces mitotic arrest of cells in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23274302_s4	Subsequently cells undergo apoptosis , indicating the major mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect .	resisting cell death
23274302_s5	To prove a potential anti-cancer activity of PDA-66 we examined the effect of PDA-66 on human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and A-459 lung cancer cells , showing a significant reduction in cancer cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner .	
23274302_s6	Thus PDA-66 is a new anti-mitotic compound with an indole-core with the potential to be used for cancer therapy .	
23274497_s0	In human epithelial cancers , the microRNA ( miRNA ) mir-30d is amplified with high frequency and serves as a critical oncomir by regulating metastasis , apoptosis , proliferation , and differentiation .	
23274497_s1	Autophagy , a degradation pathway for long-lived protein and organelles , regulates the survival and death of many cell types .	
23274497_s2	Increasing evidence suggests that autophagy plays an important function in epithelial tumor initiation and progression .	
23274497_s3	Using a combined bioinformatics approach , gene set enrichment analysis and miRNA target prediction , we found that mir-30d might regulate multiple genes in the autophagy pathway including BECN1 , BNIP3L , ATG12 , ATG5 , ATG2 .	resisting cell death
23274497_s4	Our further functional experiments demonstrated that the expression of these core proteins in the autophagy pathway was directly suppressed by mir-30d in cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23274497_s5	Finally , we showed that mir-30d regulated the autophagy process by inhibiting autophagosome formation and LC3B-I conversion to LC3B-II .	resisting cell death
23274497_s6	Taken together , our results provide evidence that the oncomir mir-30d impairs the autophagy process by targeting multiple genes in the autophagy pathway .	resisting cell death
23274497_s7	This result will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanism of mir-30d in tumorigenesis and developing novel cancer therapy strategy .	
23274516_s0	Compound C , a well-known inhibitor of the intracellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , has been reported to cause apoptotic cell death in myeloma , breast cancer cells and glioma cells .	
23274516_s1	In this study , we have demonstrated that compound C not only induced autophagy in all tested skin cancer cell lines but also caused more apoptosis in p53 wildtype skin cancer cells than in p53-mutant skin cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23274516_s2	Compound C can induce upregulation , phosphorylation and nuclear translocalization of the p53 protein and upregulate expression of p53 target genes in wildtype p53-expressing skin basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) cells .	
23274516_s3	The changes of p53 status were dependent on DNA damage which was caused by compound C induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation and associated with activated ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) protein .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
23274516_s4	Using the wildtype p53-expressing BCC cells versus stable p53-knockdown BCC sublines , we present evidence that p53-knockdown cancer cells were much less sensitive to compound C treatment with significant G2/M cell cycle arrest and attenuated the compound C-induced apoptosis but not autophagy .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23274516_s5	The compound C induced G2/M arrest in p53-knockdown BCC cells was associated with the sustained inactive Tyr15 phosphor-Cdc2 expression .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23274516_s6	Overall , our results established that compound C-induced apoptosis in skin cancer cells was dependent on the cell's p53 status .	resisting cell death
23274518_s0	Bisphenol A ( BPA ) is one of the most prevalent chemicals in daily-use materials , therefore , human exposure to BPA is ubiquitous .	
23274518_s1	We found that low concentrations of BPA stimulate the spermatogonial GC-1 cells proliferation by G protein-coupled receptor 30 ( GPR30)-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR)-extracellular regulated kinase ( ERK)-c-Fos pathway .	
23274518_s2	However , through the same pathway GPR30 expression has been shown to be induced by EGF , an EGFR ligand .	
23274518_s3	Thus , we want to know if low concentrations of BPA are able to induce the GPR30 expression and the possible mechanism(s) in GC-1 cells .	
23274518_s4	By transient transfection with expression plasmids , 10(-9)M BPA significantly transactivates the Gpr30-5'-flanking region through activating the GPR30 , cGMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKG ) , estrogen receptor-Î± ( ER-Î± ) , and EFGR-ERK pathways .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23274518_s5	Furthermore , an activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) site located within this region is found to be responsible for the transactivation of BPA .	
23274518_s6	Expectedly , through the same pathways , BPA significantly induces the gene and protein expression of GPR30. c-Fos is further observed to be strongly recruited to the AP-1 site in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and its dysfunction on the AP-1 site markedly suppresses the expression of GPR30 , p-ERK1/2 , p-Ser118-ER-Î± and cell proliferation by BPA .	
23274518_s7	Our results demonstrate that a low-concentration BPA induces GPR30 expression through the GPR30-EFGR-ERK-c-Fos , ER-Î± , and PKG pathways , presumably boosting the cells proliferation via a regulatory loop .	
23274518_s8	The present study provides a novel insight into the potential role of GPR30 in the initiation and progression of male germ cell cancer induced by environmentally relevant BPA .	
23274568_s0	Nitric oxide ( NO)-releasing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NO-NSAIDs ) which have been synthesized to reduce gastro-intestinal and cardiovascular toxicities of NSAIDs , possess anti-proliferative , pro-apoptotic and anti-cancer activities .	
23274568_s1	Here , we show that NO-sulindac inhibited UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis in SKH-1 hairless mice .	
23274568_s2	Topical application of NO-sulindac reduced tumor incidence , number ( p&lt;0.05 ) and volume ( p&lt;0.005 ) as compared to UVB ( alone)-irradiated vehicle-treated mice .	
23274568_s3	An increase in TUNEL-positive cells in skin lesions was accompanied by the enhanced Bax:Bcl-2 ratio .	resisting cell death
23274568_s4	The expression of pro-apoptotic Bax was increased whereas anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 reduced .	resisting cell death
23274568_s5	However , proliferation was identified as the major target of NO-sulindac in this study .	
23274568_s6	A reduced expression of PCNA and cyclin D1 associated with the dampening of cell cycle progression was observed .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23274568_s7	The mechanism of this inhibition was related to the reduction in UVB-induced Notch signaling pathway .	
23274568_s8	UVB-induced inflammatory responses were diminished by NO-sulindac as observed by a remarkable reduction in the levels of phosphorylated MAP Kinases Erk1/2 , p38 and JNK1/2 .	tumor promoting inflammation
23274568_s9	In this regard , NO-sulindac also inhibited NFÎºB by enhancing IÎºBÎ± as evidenced by the reduced expression of iNOS and COX-2 , the direct NFÎºB transcription target proteins .	
23274568_s10	NO-sulindac significantly diminished the progression of benign lesions to invasive carcinomas by suppressing the tumor aggressiveness and retarding epithelial-mesenchymal transition .	activating invasion and metastasis
23274568_s11	A marked decrease in the expression of mesenchymal markers such as Fibronectin , N-cadherin , SNAI , Slug and Twist and an increase in epithelial cell polarity marker E-cadherin were noted in NO-sulindac-treated tumors .	
23274568_s12	Our data suggest that NO-sulindac is a potent inhibitor of UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis and acts by targeting proliferation-regulatory pathways .	
23275006_s0	Cells undergoing malignant transformation often exhibit a shift in cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis .	
23275006_s1	This glycolytic shift , called the Warburg effect , provides a mechanistic basis for targeting glycolysis to suppress carcinogenesis through the use of dietary caloric restriction and energy restriction-mimetic agents ( ERMA ) .	
23275006_s2	We recently reported the development of a novel class of ERMAs that exhibits high potency in eliciting starvation-associated cellular responses and epigenetic changes in cancer cells though glucose uptake inhibition .	
23275006_s3	The lead ERMA in this class , OSU-CG5 , decreases the production of ATP and NADH in LNCaP prostate cancer cells .	
23275006_s4	In this study , we examined the effect of OSU-CG5 on the severity of preneoplastic lesions in male transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate ( TRAMP ) mice .	
23275006_s5	Daily oral treatment with OSU-CG5 at 100 mg/kg from 6 to 10 weeks of age resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the weight of urogenital tract and microdissected dorsal , lateral , and anterior prostatic lobes relative to vehicle controls .	
23275006_s6	The suppressive effect of OSU-CG5 was evidenced by marked decreases in Ki67 immunostaining and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) expression in the prostate .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23275006_s7	OSU-CG5 treatment was not associated with evidence of systemic toxicity .	
23275006_s8	Microarray analysis indicated a central role for Akt , and Western blot analysis showed reduced phosphorylation and/or expression levels of Akt , Src , androgen receptor , and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in prostate lobes .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23275006_s9	These findings support further investigation of OSU-CG5 as a potential chemopreventive agent .	
23275086_s0	It is well established that hyperplasia and decreased apoptosis of airway smooth muscle cells ( ASMCs ) play an important role in the asthmatic airway remodeling .	
23275086_s1	Tumor suppressor PTEN gene with phosphatase activity plays an important regulatory role in embryonic development , cell proliferation , and apoptosis , cell cycle regulation , migration ( invasion ) of the cytoskeleton .	
23275086_s2	We hypotheses that PTEN gene could affect the growth and viability of ASMCs through the regulation of PI3K/Akt , MAPK , and cell cycle-related gene expression .	
23275086_s3	We constructed a recombinant adenovirus to transfect ASMCs .	
23275086_s4	Cells were divided into the overexpression of PTEN gene group ( Ad-PTEN-GFP ) , negative control group ( Ad-GFP ) , and blank control group ( DMEM ) .	
23275086_s5	The cell apoptosis of ASMCs were evaluated by Hoechst-33342 staining and PE-7AAD double-labeled flow cytometry .	
23275086_s6	The cell cycle distribution was observed by flow cytometry with PI staining .	
23275086_s7	The expression of PTEN , p-Akt , total-Akt , p-ERK1/2 , total-ERK1/2 , cleaved-Caspases-3 , Caspases-9 , p21 , and Cyclin D1 were tested by the Western blotting .	
23275086_s8	Our study revealed that overexpression of PTEN gene did not induce apoptosis of human ASMCs cultured in vitro .	resisting cell death
23275086_s9	However , overexpression of PTEN inhibited proliferation of human ASMCs cultured in vitro and was associated with downregulation of Akt phosphorylation levels , while did not affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23275086_s10	Moreover , overexpression of PTEN could induce ASMCs arrested in the G0/G1 phase through the downregulation of Cyclin D1 and upregulation of p21 expressions .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23275152_s0	In the present study , the question was addressed whether anthocyanins interfere with the topoisomerase I poison irinotecan in vivo .	
23275152_s1	In vivo complexes of enzyme to DNA bioassay was used to detect irinotecan-induced stabilization of topoisomerase I/DNA complexes and single cell gel electrophoresis to determine DNA-strand-break induction in the colon of male Wistar rats .	
23275152_s2	Furthermore , analysis of anthocyanin concentrations in rat plasma and rat colon was included in the testing , demonstrating that anthocyanins reach the colon and the concentrations do not differ between rats that only received anthocyanins and the anthocyanin/irinotecan group .	
23275152_s3	Blackberry extract was found to significantly reduce irinotecan-mediated topoisomerase I/DNA cleavable complex formation .	
23275152_s4	Overall , anthocyanins did not notably increase cleavable complex formation .	
23275152_s5	However , a significant increase of DNA damage was shown after a single dose of irinotecan as well as the single compounds cyanidin ( cy ) and cyanidin-3-glucoside ( cy-3-g ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23275152_s6	Furthermore , a significant reduction of irinotecan-induced DNA-strand breaks after a pretreatment with cy , cy-3-g and blackberry extract was observed .	genomic instability and mutation
23275152_s7	Thus , the question arises whether anthocyanin-rich preparations might interfere with chemotherapy or whether , due to low systemic bioavailability , the preparations might provide protective potential in the gastrointestinal tract .	
23275339_s0	Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Î³ ( PPARÎ³ ) , a subgroup of ligand-activated nuclear receptors , plays critical roles in cell cycle regulation , differentiation , apoptosis and invasion .	
23275339_s1	PPARÎ³ is involved in tumorigenesis and is a potent target for cancer therapy .	
23275339_s2	PPARÎ³ transactivation of KLF4 has been demonstrated in various studies ; however , how PPARÎ³ regulates KLF4 expression is not clear .	
23275339_s3	In this study , we revealed that PPARÎ³ regulates the expression of KLF4 by binding directly to the PPAR response element ( PPRE ) within the KLF4 promoter .	
23275339_s4	The PPRE resided at -1657bp to -1669bp upstream of the KLF4 ATG codon , which is essential for the transactivation of TGZ-induced KLF4 expression .	
23275339_s5	Furthermore , we found that stable silencing of KLF4 obviously suppressed the G1/S arrest and anti-proliferation effects induced by PPARÎ³ ligands .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23275339_s6	Taken together , our data indicated that upregulating KLF4 upon PPARÎ³ activation is mediated through PPRE in KLF4 promoter , thus providing further insights into PPARÎ³ signal transduction pathway as well as a novel cancer therapeutic strategy .	
23276383_s0	Splenic haemangiosarcomas ( HSAs ) from 122 dogs were characterized and classified according to their patterns of growth , survival time post splenectomy , metastases and chemotherapy .	
23276383_s1	The most common pattern of growth was a mixture of cavernous , capillary and solid tumour tissue .	
23276383_s2	Survival time post splenectomy was independent of the growth pattern ; however , it was influenced by chemotherapy and metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
23276383_s3	Immunohistochemical assessment of the expression of angiogenic factors ( fetal liver kinase-1 , angiopoietin-2 , angiopoietin receptor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor A ) and conventional endothelial markers ( CD31 , factor VIII-related antigen ) revealed variable expression , particularly in undifferentiated HSAs .	inducing angiogenesis
23276383_s4	Therefore , a combination of endothelial markers should be used to confirm the endothelial origin of splenic tumours .	
23277201_s0	AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) has been implicated in anti-proliferative actions in a range of cell systems .	
23277201_s1	Recently , it was observed that Compound C , an inhibitor of AMPK , also reduced the cell viability in human diploid fibroblasts ( HDFs ) .	
23277201_s2	Compound C-induced growth arrest was associated with a decrease in the cell cycle regulatory proteins , such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen , phosphorylated pRB , cyclin-dependent protein kinases ( Cdk 2 and 4 ) , cyclins ( D and E ) , and the Cdk inhibitors ( p21 , p16 , and p27 ) .	
23277201_s3	Therefore , the present study examined the molecular mechanism of the antiproliferative effects of Compound C. Although Compound C inhibited serum-induced phosphorylation of Akt and its substrate , glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² , it did not affect the Akt activity in vitro .	
23277201_s4	Compound C significantly inhibited the receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and the activity of downstream signaling molecules , such as p85 phosphoinositide 3-kinase , phospholipase C-Î³1 , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 , induced by platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) but not by epidermal growth factor- and insulin-like growth factor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23277201_s5	In vitro growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity profiling revealed the IC(50) for PDGF receptor-Î² ( PDGFRÎ² ) to be 5.07 Î¼M , whereas the IC(50) for the epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor was â¥100 Î¼M .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23277201_s6	The inhibitory effect of Compound C on PDGFRÎ² and Akt was also observed in AMPKÎ±(1)/Î±(2)-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts , indicating that its inhibitory effect is independent of the AMPK activity .	
23277201_s7	The inhibitory effect of Compound C on cell proliferation and PDGFRÎ² tyrosine phosphorylation was also demonstrated in various PDGFR-expressing cells , including MRC-5 , BEAS-2B , rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells , and A172 glioblastoma cells .	
23277201_s8	These results indicate that Compound C can be used as a potential antiproliferative agent for PDGF- or PDGFR-associated diseases , such as cancer , atherosclerosis , and fibrosis .	
23278137_s0	BACKGROUND O(6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) is a DNA repair enzyme that can protect cells from carcinogenic effects of alkylating agents by removing adducts from the O(6) position of guanine .	
23278137_s1	Evidences indicated that areca quid chewing may increase the risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) .	
23278137_s2	This study was to investigate the role of MGMT expression in OSCCs and the normal oral tissues .	
23278137_s3	METHODS Thirty-two OSCCs from areca quid chewers and ten normal oral tissue biopsy samples without areca quid chewing were analyzed by the immunohistochemistry for MGMT .	
23278137_s4	Primary human oral keratinocytes ( HOKs ) were challenged with arecoline , the major alkaloid of areca nut , by Western blot .	
23278137_s5	Nicotine , an important component of cigarette smoke , was added to find the possible regulatory mechanisms .	
23278137_s6	RESULTS Significant association was observed between low MGMT expression and advanced clinical stage of OSCCs and lymph node metastasis ( P=0.03 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
23278137_s7	MGMT expression was significantly higher in patients only chewing areca quid than patients both chewing areca quid and smoking ( P=0.028 ) .	
23278137_s8	Arecoline was found to elevate MGMT expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner .	genomic instability and mutation
23278137_s9	The addition of nicotine was found to enhance arecoline-induced MGMT expression .	genomic instability and mutation
23278137_s10	CONCLUSION Our results indicate that MGMT could be used clinically as a predictive marker for tumor processing , the potential for lymph node metastasis as well as advanced clinical stage .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
23278137_s11	MGMT expression was significantly upregulated by arecoline in HOKs .	genomic instability and mutation
23278137_s12	Nicotine has a synergistic effect of arecoline-induced MGMT expression .	genomic instability and mutation
23278137_s13	The cigarette smoking may act synergistically in the pathogenesis of OSCC in areca quid chewers via the upregulation of MGMT .	genomic instability and mutation
23279696_s0	The ALKBH family of proteins are highly expressed in various types of human cancer where they are involved in tumor growth and progression .	
23279696_s1	However , multiple isoforms of ALKBH exist and the effect of individual isoforms on the development of urinary bladder cancer is unknown , particularly the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression from a noninvasive to invasive phenotype .	
23279696_s2	We examined the role and function of ALKBH2 in human bladder cancer development in vitro and provide the first report that suppression of ALKBH2 in a human urothelial carcinoma cell line , KU7 , reduced the expression of the transmembrane mucin protein , MUC1 , and induced G1 cell cycle arrest .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23279696_s3	Moreover , reduction of ALKBH2 suppressed epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) via increasing E-cadherin and decreasing vimentin expression .	activating invasion and metastasis
23279696_s4	Transfection of MUC1 siRNA inhibited cell proliferation and EMT to the same extent as ALKBH2 gene silencing in vitro .	activating invasion and metastasis
23279696_s5	ALKBH2 knockdown significantly suppressed MUC1 expression and tumor volume of bladder cancers in vivo as assessed in an orthotopic mouse model using ALKBH2 shRNA transfected KU7 cells .	
23279696_s6	Immunohistochemical examination showed high expression levels of ALKBH2 in human urothelial carcinoma samples , especially in high-grade , superficially and deeply invasive carcinomas ( pT(1) and &gt;pT(2) ) , and in carcinoma in situ but not in normal urothelium .	
23279696_s7	This study demonstrates that ALKBH2 is an upstream molecule of the oncoprotein , MUC1 , and regulates cell cycle and EMT , resulting in progression of urothelial carcinomas .	activating invasion and metastasis,evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23280101_s0	Sonodynamic therapy ( SDT ) has shown great potential in target cancer therapy , but it induced cell death modes hasn't been fully investigated .	
23280101_s1	This study was to examine autophagic and apoptotic responses to protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX ) mediated SDT in murine leukemia L1210 cells .	
23280101_s2	After SDT , the occurrence of autophagy was identified by morphological observation and biochemical analysis .	
23280101_s3	Meanwhile , the mitochondria dependent apoptosis pathway was examined to participate in SDT induced cell death .	
23280101_s4	The relationship between autophagy and apoptosis was further investigated by applying pharmacological inhibition studies , which indicated that impairment of autophagy enhanced the anti-tumor effect of SDT through induction of apoptosis and necrosis , while caspase inhibition didn't affect autophagic vacuoles formation or protect SDT induced cytotoxicity .	resisting cell death
23280101_s5	The findings supported that autophagic vacuoles formed upstream and independently from caspase-dependent cell death .	resisting cell death
23280101_s6	Additionally , the possible mechanism of SDT-induced autophagy was evaluated by measurement of ROS ( reactive oxygen species ) formation .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23280101_s7	Result suggested ROS play important role in initiating autophagy , possibly through the sono-damaged mitochondria being enclosed by autophagic vacuoles .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23280101_s8	All together , these data indicate that autophagy may be cytoprotective in our experimental system , and point to an important insight into how autophagy inhibitors , in combination with SDT may contribute a regimen for cancer therapy .	resisting cell death
23280316_s0	Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in Western countries .	
23280316_s1	A significant number of CRC patients undergoing curatively intended surgery subsequently develop recurrence and die from the disease .	
23280316_s2	MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are aberrantly expressed in cancers and appear to have both diagnostic and prognostic significance .	
23280316_s3	In this study , we identified novel miRNAs associated with recurrence of CRC , and their possible mechanism of action .	
23280316_s4	TaqManï¿½ Human MicroRNA Array Set v2.0 was used to profile the expression of 667 miRNAs in 14 normal colon mucosas and 46 microsatellite stable CRC tumors .	
23280316_s5	Four miRNAs ( miR-362-3p , miR-570 , miR-148a* and miR-944 ) were expressed at a higher level in tumors from patients with no recurrence ( p &lt ; 0.015 ) , compared to tumors from patients with recurrence .	
23280316_s6	A significant association with increased disease free survival was confirmed for miR-362-3p in a second independent cohort of 43 CRC patients , using single TaqManï¿½ microRNA assays .	
23280316_s7	In vitro functional analysis showed that over-expression of miR-362-3p in colon cancer cell lines reduced cell viability , and proliferation mainly due to cell cycle arrest .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23280316_s8	E2F1 , USF2 and PTPN1 were identified as potential miR-362-3p targets by mRNA profiling of HCT116 cells over-expressing miR-362-3p .	
23280316_s9	Subsequently , these genes were confirmed as direct targets by Luciferase reporter assays .	
23280316_s10	Their knockdown in vitro phenocopied the effects of miR-362-3p over-expression .	
23280316_s11	We conclude that miR-362-3p may be a novel prognostic marker in CRC , and hypothesize that the positive effects of augmented miR-362-3p expression may in part be mediated through the targets E2F1 , USF2 and PTPN1. ï¿½ 2012 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .	
23280485_s0	Dichlorvos , an organophosphate ( OP ) , is known to cause oxidative stress in the central nervous system ( CNS ) .	
23280485_s1	Previously we have shown that dichlorvos treatment promoted the levels of proinflammatory molecules and ultimately induced apoptotic cell death in primary microglial cells .	
23280485_s2	Here we studied the effect of dichlorvos on crucial cell cycle regulatory proteins and the DNA damage sensor ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) .	
23280485_s3	We found a significant increase in p53 and its downstream target , p21 , levels in dichlorvos-treated microglial cells compared with control cells .	evading growth suppressors
23280485_s4	Moreover , dichlorvos exposure promoted the levels of different cell cycle regulatory proteins .	evading growth suppressors
23280485_s5	These results along with flow cytometry results suggested that primary microglial cells were arrested at G1 and G2/M phase after dichlorvos exposure .	
23280485_s6	We have shown in a previous study that dichlorvos can induce DNA damage in microglia ; here we found that microglial cells also tried to repair this damage by inducing a DNA repair enzyme , i.e. , ATM .	
23280485_s7	We observed a significant increase in the levels of ATM after dichlorvos treatment compared with control .	
23280601_s0	MD-Fraction is a highly purified soluble Î²-glucan derived from Grifola frondosa ( an oriental edible mushroom ) .	
23280601_s1	Intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection of MD-Fraction has been reported to inhibit tumor growth via enhancement of the host immune system .	
23280601_s2	In this study , we demonstrated that oral administration of MD-Fraction as well as i.p. injection significantly inhibited tumor growth in murine tumor models .	
23280601_s3	After oral administration , MD-Fraction was not transferred to the blood in its free form but was captured by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells ( DCs ) present in the Peyer's patch .	
23280601_s4	The captured MD-Fraction was then transported to the spleen , thereby inducing the systemic immune response .	avoiding immune destruction
23280601_s5	Our study showed that MD-Fraction directly induced DC maturation via a C-type lectin receptor dectin-1 pathway .	
23280601_s6	The therapeutic response of orally administered MD-Fraction was associated with ( i ) induced systemic tumor-antigen specific T cell response via dectin-1-dependent activation of DCs , ( ii ) increased infiltration of the activated T cells into the tumor , and ( iii ) decreased number of tumor-caused immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells .	avoiding immune destruction
23280601_s7	Our preclinical study suggests that MD-Fraction is a useful oral therapeutic agent in the management of patients with cancer. ï¿½ 2012 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .	
23284640_s0	The anti-tumor antibiotic salinomycin ( Sal ) was recently identified as a selective inhibitor of breast cancer stem cells ; however , the effect of Sal on hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is not clear .	
23284640_s1	This study aimed to determine the anti-tumor efficacy and mechanism of Sal on HCC .	
23284640_s2	HCC cell lines ( HepG2 , SMMC-7721 , and BEL-7402 ) were treated with Sal .	
23284640_s3	Cell doubling time was determinated by drawing growth curve , cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit 8 .	
23284640_s4	The fraction of CD133(+) cell subpopulations was assessed by flow cytometry .	
23284640_s5	We found that Sal inhibits proliferation and decreases PCNA levels as well as the proportion of HCC CD133(+)cell subpopulations in HCC cells .	
23284640_s6	Cell cycle was analyzed using flow cytometry and showed that Sal caused cell cycle arrest of the various HCC cell lines in different phases .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23284640_s7	Cell apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining .	
23284640_s8	Sal induced apoptosis as characterized by an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio .	resisting cell death
23284640_s9	Several signaling pathways were selected for further mechanistic analyses using real time-PCR and Western blot assays .	
23284640_s10	Compared to control , Î²-catenin expression is significantly down-regulated upon Sal addition .	
23284640_s11	The Ca(2+) concentration in HCC cells was examined by flow cytometry and higher Ca(2+) concentrations were observed in Sal treatment groups .	
23284640_s12	The anti-tumor effect of Sal was further verified in vivo using the hepatoma orthotopic tumor model and the data obtained showed that the size of liver tumors in Sal-treated groups decreased compared to controls .	
23284640_s13	Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining also demonstrated that Sal inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in vivo .	resisting cell death
23284640_s14	Finally , the role of Sal on in vivo Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling was evaluated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry .	
23284640_s15	This study demonstrates Sal inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo and one potential mechanism is inhibition of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling via increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels .	resisting cell death
23284663_s0	The pancreatic stellate cells ( PSCs ) have complex roles in pancreas , including tissue repair and fibrosis .	
23284663_s1	PSCs surround ATP releasing exocrine cells , but little is known about purinergic receptors and their function in PSCs .	
23284663_s2	Our aim was to resolve whether PSCs express the multifunctional P2X7 receptor and elucidate how it regulates PSC viability .	
23284663_s3	The number of PSCs isolated from wild type ( WT ) mice was 50% higher than those from the Pfizer P2X7 receptor knock out ( KO ) mice .	
23284663_s4	The P2X7 receptor protein and mRNA of all known isoforms were expressed in WT PSCs , while KO PSCs only expressed truncated versions of the receptor .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23284663_s5	In culture , the proliferation rate of the KO PSCs was significantly lower .	
23284663_s6	Inclusion of apyrase reduced the proliferation rate in both WT and KO PSCs , indicating importance of endogenous ATP .	
23284663_s7	Exogenous ATP had a two-sided effect .	
23284663_s8	Proliferation of both WT and KO cells was stimulated with ATP in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 100 ÂµM .	
23284663_s9	At high ATP concentration ( 5 mM ) , WT PSCs , but not the KO PSCs died .	
23284663_s10	The intracellular Ca(2+) signals and proliferation rate induced by micromolar ATP concentrations were inhibited by the allosteric P2X7 receptor inhibitor az10606120 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23284663_s11	The P2X7 receptor-pore inhibitor A438079 partially prevented cell death induced by millimolar ATP concentrations .	
23284663_s12	This study shows that ATP and P2X7 receptors are important regulators of PSC proliferation and death , and therefore might be potential targets for treatments of pancreatic fibrosis and cancer .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23285165_s0	Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the most prevalent liver tumor and a deadly disease with limited therapeutic options .	
23285165_s1	Dysregulation of cell signaling pathways is a common denominator in tumorigenesis , including hepatocarcinogenesis .	
23285165_s2	The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signaling system is commonly activated in HCC , and is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic target in combination therapies .	
23285165_s3	We and others have identified a central role for the EGFR ligand amphiregulin ( AR ) in the proliferation , survival and drug resistance of HCC cells .	
23285165_s4	AR expression is frequently up-regulated in HCC tissues and cells through mechanisms not completely known .	
23285165_s5	Here we identify the Î²-catenin signaling pathway as a novel mechanism leading to transcriptional activation of the AR gene in human HCC cells .	
23285165_s6	Activation of Î²-catenin signaling , or expression of the T41A Î²-catenin active mutant , led to the induction of AR expression involving three specific Î²-catenin-Tcf responsive elements in its proximal promoter .	
23285165_s7	We demonstrate that HCC cells expressing the T41A Î²-catenin active mutant show enhanced proliferation that is dependent in part on AR expression and EGFR signaling .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23285165_s8	We also demonstrate here a novel cross-talk of the EGFR system with fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23285165_s9	FGF19 is a recently identified driver gene in hepatocarcinogenesis and an activator of Î²-catenin signaling in HCC and colon cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23285165_s10	We show that FGF19 induced AR gene expression through the Î²-catenin pathway in human HCC cells .	
23285165_s11	Importantly , AR up-regulation and EGFR signaling participated in the induction of cyclin D1 and cell proliferation elicited by FGF19 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23285165_s12	Finally , we demonstrate a positive correlation between FGF19 and AR expression in human HCC tissues , therefore supporting in clinical samples our experimental observations .	
23285165_s13	These findings identify the AR/EGFR system as a key mediator of FGF19 responses in HCC cells involving Î²-catenin signaling , and suggest that combined targeting of FGF19 and AR/EGFR may enhance therapeutic efficacy .	
23285263_s0	Lung cancers express the cholinergic autocrine loop , which facilitates the progression of cancer cells .	
23285263_s1	The antagonists of mAChRs have been demonstrated to depress the growth of small cell lung cancers ( SCLCs ) .	
23285263_s2	In this study we intended to investigate the growth inhibitory effect of R2HBJJ , a novel muscarinic antagonist , on non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells and the possible mechanisms .	
23285263_s3	The competitive binding assay revealed that R2HBJJ had a high affinity to M3 and M1 AChRs .	
23285263_s4	R2HBJJ presented a strong anticholinergic activity on carbachol-induced contraction of guinea-pig trachea .	
23285263_s5	R2HBJJ markedly suppressed the growth of NSCLC cells , such as H1299 , H460 and H157 .	
23285263_s6	In H1299 cells , both R2HBJJ and its leading compound R2-PHC displayed significant anti-proliferative activity as M3 receptor antagonist darifenacin .	
23285263_s7	Exogenous replenish of ACh could attenuate R2HBJJ-induced growth inhibition .	
23285263_s8	Silencing M3 receptor or ChAT by specific-siRNAs resulted in a growth inhibition of 55.5% and 37.9% on H1299 cells 96 h post transfection , respectively .	
23285263_s9	Further studies revealed that treatment with R2HBJJ arrested the cell cycle in G0/G1 by down-regulation of cyclin D1-CDK4/6-Rb .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23285263_s10	Therefore , the current study reveals that NSCLC cells express an autocrine and paracrine cholinergic system which stimulates the growth of NSCLC cells .	
23285263_s11	R2HBJJ , as a novel mAChRs antagonist , can block the local cholinergic loop by antagonizing predominantly M3 receptors and inhibit NSCLC cell growth , which suggest that M3 receptor antagonist might be a potential chemotherapeutic regimen for NSCLC .	
23285288_s0	DNA repair is an essential cellular process required to maintain genomic stability .	
23285288_s1	Every cell is subjected to thousands of DNA lesions daily under normal physiological conditions .	
23285288_s2	Ionizing radiation ( IR ) is a major DNA damaging agent that can be produced by both natural and man-made sources .	
23285288_s3	A common source of radiation exposure is through its use in medical diagnostics or treatments such as for cancer radiotherapy where relatively high doses are received by patients .	
23285288_s4	To understand the detailed DNA repair gene transcription response to high dose IR , gene expression exon array studies have been performed and the response to radiation in two divergent cell types , lymphoblastoid cell lines and primary fibroblasts , has been examined .	
23285288_s5	These exon arrays detect expression levels across the entire gene , and have the advantage of high sensitivity and the ability to identify alternative transcripts .	
23285288_s6	We found a selection of DNA repair genes , including some not previously reported , that are modulated in response to radiation .	genomic instability and mutation
23285288_s7	Detailed dose and time course kinetics of DNA repair transcription was conducted and results have been validated utilizing PCR methods .

23285698_s1	Agents capable of inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells seem a promising approach to treat this malignancy .	
23285698_s2	In this study we describe the synthesis of a number of novel N- and N,N'-substituted S-2,3,4,5,6-pentabromobenzylisothiouronium bromides and their activity against the human prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cell line .	
23285698_s3	All the compounds produced changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cell cycle progression , showed a cytostatic effect and induced apoptosis in the tested cancer line in a concentration- and time-dependent manner .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling

23285698_s5	Two selected S-2,3,4,5,6-pentabromobenzylisothiouronium bromides ( ZKK-3 , ZKK-9 ) showed also a synergic proapoptotic effect with the new casein kinase II inhibitor 2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole ( TBIPIP ) in the PC3 cell line .	resisting cell death
23286398_s0	Objective To investigate the effect of bufalin on nucleus-mitochondria localization of human telomerase reverse transcriptase(hTERT) by exploring its effect on proliferation and apoptosis in human esophageal squamous carcinoma EC9706 cells .	
23286398_s1	Methods EC9706 cells were treated with bufalin at various concentrations , and then the cell growth inhibition of EC9706 cells was examined by CCK-8 assay and the 50% inhibitory concentration ( IC(50) ) was calculated.Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry with PI staining , and nucleus morphology of apoptosis were observed by fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33342 staining .	
23286398_s2	The apoptotic index was measured by flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. hTERT subcellular localization and protein expression were determined by Western blotting and multiple immunofluorescence labling combined with laser confocal scanning microscopy .	
23286398_s3	Results The proliferation of EC 9706 cells was significantly inhibited by bufalin along with the increase of processing time and concentrations ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	
23286398_s4	After the EC9706 cells were exposed to 100 nmol/L bufalin,the number of cells gradually decreased in G(1) phase and increased in S and G(2)/M phases(p&lt;0.05) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23286398_s5	The typical nucleus morphological changes of apoptosis were observed and the apoptotic index was increased(p&lt;0.01) .	resisting cell death
23286398_s6	The expression of hTERT decreased in nucleus but increased in mitochondria(p&lt;0.05) .	
23286398_s7	Conclusions Bufalin can inhibit the proliferation of human esophageal squamous carcinoma EC9706 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner .	
23286398_s8	It can arrest cell cycle in S and G(2)/M phases and induce the apoptosis of EC 9706 cells. hTERT is localized in both nucleus and mitochondria,and can be partially translocated from nucleus to mitochondria during the bufalin-induced apoptosis .	
23287468_s0	Induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells share some basic properties , such as self-renewal and pluripotency , with cancer cells , and they also appear to share several metabolic alterations that are commonly observed in human tumors .	
23287468_s1	The cancer cells ' glycolytic phenotype , first reported by Otto Warburg , is necessary for the optimal routing of somatic cells to pluripotency .	
23287468_s2	However , how iPS cells establish a Warburg-like metabolic phenotype and whether the metabolic pathways that support the bioenergetics of iPS cells are produced by the same mechanisms that are selected during the tumorigenic process remain largely unexplored .	
23287468_s3	We recently investigated whether the reprogramming-competent metabotype of iPS cells involves changes in the activation/expression status of the H ( + ) -ATPase , which is a core component of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation that is repressed at both the activity and protein levels in human carcinomas , and of the lipogenic switch , which refers to a marked overexpression and hyperactivity of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase ( ACACA ) and fatty acid synthase ( FASN ) lipogenic enzymes that has been observed in nearly all examined cancer types .	
23287468_s4	A comparison of a starting population of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and their iPS cell progeny revealed that somatic cell reprogramming involves a significant increase in the expression of ATPase inhibitor factor 1 ( IF1 ) , accompanied by extremely low expression levels of the catalytic Î²-F1-ATPase subunit .	
23287468_s5	The pharmacological inhibition of ACACA and FASN activities markedly decreases reprogramming efficiency , and ACACA and FASN expression are notably upregulated in iPS cells .	
23287468_s6	Importantly , iPS cells exhibited a significant intracellular accumulation of neutral lipid bodies ; however , these bodies may be a reflection of intense lysosomal/autophagocytic activity rather than bona fide lipid droplet formation in iPS cells , as they were largely unresponsive to pharmacological modulation of PPARgamma and FASN activities .	
23287468_s7	The AMPK agonist metformin , which endows somatic cells with a bioenergetic infrastructure that is protected against reprogramming , was found to drastically elongate fibroblast mitochondria , fully reverse the high IF1/Î²-F1-ATPase ratio and downregulate the ACACA/FASN lipogenic enzymes in iPS cells .	
23287468_s8	The mitochondrial H ( + ) -ATP synthase and the ACACA/FASN-driven lipogenic switch are newly characterized as instrumental metabolic events that , by coupling the Warburg effect to anabolic metabolism , enable de-differentiation during the reprogramming of somatic cells to iPS cells .	cellular energetics
23289018_s0	Filamin-A cross-links actin filaments into dynamic orthogonal networks , and interacts with an array of proteins of diverse cellular functions .	
23289018_s1	Because several filamin-A interaction partners are implicated in signaling of cell mobility regulation , we tested the hypothesis that filamin-A plays a role in cancer metastasis .	
23289018_s2	Using four pairs of filamin-A proficient and deficient isogenic cell lines , we found that filamin-A deficiency in cancer cells significantly reduces their migration and invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
23289018_s3	Using a xenograft tumor model with subcutaneous and intracardiac injections of tumor cells , we found that the filamin-A deficiency causes significant reduction of lung , splenic and systemic metastasis in nude mice .	activating invasion and metastasis
23289018_s4	We evaluated the expression of filamin-A in breast cancer tissues by immunohistochemical staining , and found that low levels of filamin-A expression in cancer cells of the tumor tissues are associated with a better distant metastasis-free survival than those with normal levels of filamin-A .	activating invasion and metastasis
23289018_s5	These data not only validate filamin-A as a prognostic marker for cancer metastasis , but also suggest that inhibition of filamin-A in cancer cells may reduce metastasis and that filamin-A can be used as a therapeutic target for filamin-A positive cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis
23289480_s0	The increasing evidence supported the role of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 ( EZH2 ) in the cancer development and progression .	
23289480_s1	However , its precise role in the tumorigenesis of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma ( NPC ) remains to be elucidated .	
23289480_s2	EZH2 was depleted by retroviral infection in the NPC cells ( HK-1 , CNE-2 , CNE-1 and C666-1 ) .	
23289480_s3	The degree of EZH2 knockdown was then assessed by real-time quantitative PCR and Western Blot analysis .	
23289480_s4	Cell proliferation was assessed using the soluble tetrazolium salt ( MTS ) cell proliferation assay , and cell cycle was measured by FACS test .	
23289480_s5	The methylation status of p16(INK4a )was determined by bisulphate treatment of the DNA , followed by MSP .	
23289480_s6	EZH2 was over-expressed in NPC cells , and the expression in undifferentiated-derived NPC cells ( CNE-1 , C666-1 ) was more significant than differentiated-derived NPC cells ( HK-1 , CNE-2 ) .	
23289480_s7	EZH2 was successfully depleted after retroviral infection in C666-1 cells , and the EZH2 depletion could inhibit the proliferation and arrested G1/S phase of NPC cells .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23289480_s8	In addition , both mRNA and protein levels of p16(INK4a) increased significantly in presence of EZH2 depletion .	
23289480_s9	The further Methylation-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction ( MSP ) assay suggested that over-expressed EZH2 may contribute to the reduction of p16(INK4a) expression by hyper methylating its promoter .	
23289480_s10	EZH2 is overexpressed in NPC and reduces expression of p16(INK4a) by influencing methylation , opening therapeutic options .	
23291718_s0	Immunosuppressive oligodeoxynucleotides ( SupODNs ) containing repetitive TTAGGG motifs reduce inflammation and , thus , may have an impact on inflammationârelated tumor growth .	
23291718_s1	In this study , we found a significant antiproliferative effect of Sup ODNs on the A549 nonâsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell line compared to those treated with control ODNs ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	
23291718_s2	Sup-ODN-mediated G1 phase cell cycle arrest was achieved via inhibition of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and the p15INK4b and p27KIP1/retinoblastoma protein pathway .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23291718_s3	In addition , Sup ODNs induced apoptosis and enhanced apoptosis when combined with vinorelbine .	resisting cell death
23291718_s4	In a setting similar to clinical use of multidrug chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC , these effects were investigated by using Sup ODNs in combination with conventional anticancer drugs .	
23291718_s5	Sup ODNs had a significant synergistic effect with 5-fluorouracil , vinorelbine , gemcitabine , paclitaxel and irinotecan , with a mean combination index of 0.43-0.78 ( &lt;1.0 indicates synergism ) in the A549 NSCLC cell line .	
23291718_s6	In conclusion , our results showed that Sup ODNs have an anticancer effect and increase the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to conventional anticancer drugs by modifying Akt and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway .	
23291718_s7	Thus , Sup ODNs may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients .	
23291854_s0	In mammalian cells more than 90% of double-strand breaks are repaired by NHEJ .	
23291854_s1	Impairment of this pathway is associated with cell cycle arrest , cell death , genomic instability and cancer .	
23291854_s2	Human diseases such as Nijmegen breakage syndrome , due to mutations in the NBS1 gene , produce defects in resection of double-strand breaks .	
23291854_s3	NBS1 hypomorphic mutant mice are viable , and cells from these mice are defective in S phase and G2/M checkpoints .	
23291854_s4	NBS1 polymorphisms have been associated with increased risk of breast cancer .	
23291854_s5	We previously demonstrated that estradiol protected estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive ( + ) breast cancer cell lines against double-strand breaks and cell death .	
23291854_s6	We now demonstrate that protection from double-strand break damage in ER+ cells is mediated via regulation by c-myc , p53 , CBP and SRC1 coactivators in intron 1 of the NBS1 gene .	genomic instability and mutation
23291854_s7	We concluded that NBS1 is responsible for estradiol-mediated protection from double-strand breaks in ER+ breast cancer cells .	genomic instability and mutation
23291974_s0	Diarylquinoline compounds are newly synthesized derivatives of the new anti-tuberculosis drug , TMC207 .	
23291974_s1	In this study , nine diarylquinoline compounds were screened for cytotoxic activity against human tumor cells , and their mechanisms of action were investigated .	
23291974_s2	Among the nine compounds , STM-57 [ N-((6-bromo-2-methoxyquinolin-3-yl)(phenyl)methl)-N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(4 -methylpiperazin-1-yl)propanamide ] showed potent cytotoxic activity .	
23291974_s3	STM-57 induced caspase-independent cell death in the human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line , CNE-2 .	
23291974_s4	Further investigation showed that STM-57 induced autophagy , as determined with the increased expression of green fluorescent protein-light chain3 ( GFP-LC3 ) and increased LC3-II levels .	resisting cell death
23291974_s5	STM-57 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) in CNE-2 cells .	
23291974_s6	The intracellular calcium concentration and reactive oxygen species levels were increased in CNE-2 cells following treatment with STM-57 , whereas the mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( ÎÎ¨m ) and ATP concentrations were decreased .	tumor promoting inflammation
23292149_s0	Here , we provide the necessary proof of concept , that it is possible to metabolically create a non-permissive or " hostile " stromal microenvironment , which actively prevents tumor engraftment in vivo .	
23292149_s1	We developed a novel genetically engineered fibroblast cell line that completely prevents tumor formation in mice , with a 100% protection rate .	
23292149_s2	No host side effects were apparent.This could represent a viable cellular strategy for preventing and treating a variety of human cancers .	
23292149_s3	More specifically , we examined the autocrine and paracrine effects of the cellular delivery of TNF-alpha on breast cancer tumor growth and cancer metabolism .	
23292149_s4	For this purpose , we recombinantly overexpressed TNF-alpha in human breast cancer cells ( MDA-MB-231 ) or human immortalized fibroblasts ( hTERT-BJ1 ) .	
23292149_s5	Our results directly show that TNF-alpha functions as a potent tumor suppressor .	
23292149_s6	Remarkably , TNF-alpha-expressing breast cancer cells were viable , without any significant increases in their basal apoptotic rate .	resisting cell death
23292149_s7	However , after 4 weeks post-implantation , TNF-alpha-expressing breast cancer cells failed to form any tumors in xenografted mice ( 0 tumors/10 injections ) , ultimately conferring 100% protection against tumorigenesis .	
23292149_s8	Similarly , TNF-alpha-overexpressing fibroblasts were also viable , without any increases in apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23292149_s9	Significantly , complete tumor suppression was obtained by co-injecting TNF-alpha expressing stromal fibroblasts with human breast cancer cells , indicating that paracrine cell-mediated delivery of TNF-alpha can also prevent tumor engraftment and growth ( 0 tumors/10 injections ) .	
23292149_s10	Mechanistically , TNF-alpha induced autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in both epithelial cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts , preventing energy transfer from the tumor microenvironment , likely " starving " the cancer cells to death .	
23292149_s11	In addition , via qRT-PCR analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells , we observed that TNF-alpha mediated the up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with inflammation and senescence [ IL-1-beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , MCP-1 , COX-2 , p21(WAF1/CIP1) ] and downregulated known tumor-promoting genes ( collagen VI and MMP2 ) .	enabling replicative immortality,tumor promoting inflammation
23292149_s12	Recombinant overexpression of TNF-alpha receptor(s) in MDA-MB-231 cells also significantly reduced tumor growth , but was not as effective as the TNF-alpha ligand itself in preventing tumor growth .	
23292149_s13	Thus , we propose that stromal cell-mediated delivery of TNF-alpha to human tumors [ using transfected fibroblasts or mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs) ] may be a novel and effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of human cancers .	
23292493_s0	The aberrant expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER-2 ) has been detected in ovarian cancer .	
23292493_s1	However , the role of HER-2 in the development of ovarian cancer has not been sufficiently elucidated .	
23292493_s2	The objective of this study was to determine the role of HER-2 in the apoptosis and metastasis of SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells .	
23292493_s3	SKOV-3 cells were transfected with three doubleâstranded small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) molecules that target HER-2 .	
23292493_s4	Various sequences were synthesized by T7 transcription invitro to select the most effective HER-2âsilencing siRNA .	
23292493_s5	SKOV-3 cells were examined for growth inhibition using the MTT proliferation assay and apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry and TUNEL assay .	
23292493_s6	The Matrigel basement memebrane matrix was used to assess invasion and chemotactic mobility , as a model of tumor cell metastasis .	
23292493_s7	Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of matrix metallopeptidase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , E-cadherin , N-cadherin and vimentin. siRNA interference in HER-2 resulted in decreased cell proliferation and invasion and increased apoptosis .	
23292493_s8	Western blot analysis demonstrated a marked increase in E-cadherin and MMP-9 and a reduction in N-cadherin and vimentin protein levels in the SKOV-3 cells .	
23292493_s9	The suppression of HER-2 expression resulted in apoptosis and the inhibition of metastasis of SKOV-3 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
23292493_s10	Therefore , the overexpression of the HER-2 gene can enhance the metastatic potential of SKOV-3 cells by increasing the protein levels of MMP-9 .	activating invasion and metastasis
23292493_s11	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition may be involved in the HER-2 siRNA-induced invasion and migration of SKOV-3 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23292493_s12	Taken together , these results suggest that HER-2 functions as an oncogene and may thus be an attractive therapeutic target in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23292685_s0	Cell invasion is required for neoplastic metastasis .	
23292685_s1	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , which degrades the extracellular matrix , is a major component in the process of cancer cell invasion .	
23292685_s2	Sulfuretin is one of the major flavonoids isolated from Rhus verniciflua .	
23292685_s3	Sulfuretin has been used to reduce oxidative stress , platelet aggregation , the inflammatory response and mutagenesis .	
23292685_s4	However , the effect of sulfuretin on breast cancer metastasis is unknown .	
23292685_s5	In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effect of sulfuretin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion in MCF-7 cells .	
23292685_s6	Sulfuretin inhibited TPA-induced transcriptional activation of nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) .	
23292685_s7	We demonstrated that sulfuretin mediated the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and that cell invasion in MCF-7 cells involved suppression of the NF-κB pathway .	activating invasion and metastasis
23292685_s8	Therefore , inhibiting MMP-9 expression by sulfuretin may have therapeutic potential for controlling breast cancer invasiveness .	activating invasion and metastasis
23293472_s0	Prostate cancer is responsible for major deaths globally after lung cancer .	
23293472_s1	However , etiology of prostate cancer is still unknown .	
23293472_s2	Individual risk and incidence of prostate cancer may result from the interaction of genetic susceptibility with exposure to environmental factors such as infectious agents , tobacco , occupational exposure , dietary carcinogens , and/or hormonal imbalances leading to injury of the prostate and to the development of chronic inflammation .	
23293472_s3	About 30% of all human cancers are caused by tobacco smoking and inhaled pollutants .	
23293472_s4	Inflammation is now regarded as an important hallmark of cancer .	
23293472_s5	The present study has been aimed to explore the pro-inflammatory levels in prostate carcinoma patients by examining the serum levels of novel cytokine interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) expression in tobacco exposed population .	
23293472_s6	A total of 578 ( n = 284 biopsy proven prostate cancer patients , n = 294 controls with and without tobacco exposed population ) were recruited .	
23293472_s7	Serum IL-18 ( Interleukin-18 ) level was done by ELISA .	
23293472_s8	The IL-18 levels between cancer patients and controls within same mode tobacco exposure as tobacco smoking ( overall ) showed significant difference ( P &lt ; 0.0001 ) and further we compared within stratified group , it significantly differ ( P &lt ; 0.0001 ) in bidi and cigarette smoking than control non users .	
23293472_s9	Furthermore , IL-18 levels in tobacco chewers ( overall ) with gutkha and khaini chewers showed significant difference ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) than controls non users .	
23293472_s10	Moreover , the IL-18 levels between cancer patients and controls with in of combined mode chewers smokers and alcohol ( CSA ) , smokers with alcohol showed significant difference ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) than controls .	
23293472_s11	The IL-18 levels also differed significantly ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) with smokers and chewers in higher stages of III and IV , and showed non significant with in lower stages .	
23293472_s12	Tobacco exposure enhance the inflammation in prostate carcinoma patients in stratified group as it have been represented as a risk factors in various cancers , but this study provide further its role that seems to influence inflammation especially in prostate carcinoma .	tumor promoting inflammation
23294923_s0	OBJECTIVE In addition to its effects on cholesterol levels , apoE3 has lipid-independent effects that contribute to cardiovascular protection ; one of these effects is the ability to inhibit cell cycling in VSMCs .	
23294923_s1	The goal of this study was to identify and characterize cell cycle-regulatory mechanisms responsible for the anti-mitogenic effect of apoE .	
23294923_s2	METHODS AND RESULTS Primary VSMCs were stimulated with serum in the absence or presence of apoE3. apoE3 upregulated expression of the cdk inhibitor , p27(kip1) , in primary VSMCs , and this effect required Cox2 and activation of PGI(2)-IP signaling .	evading growth suppressors
23294923_s3	The microRNA family , miR221/222 has recently been identified as a post-translational regulator of p27 , and apoE3 inhibited miR221/222 expression in a Cox2- and PGI(2)/IP-dependent manner .	
23294923_s4	Moreover , reconstituted miR222 expression was sufficient to override the effects of apoE on p27 expression and S phase entry .	
23294923_s5	The ability to repress expression of miR221/222 is shared by apoE3-containing HDL but is absent from apoA-1 , LDL and apoE-depleted HDL .	
23294923_s6	All three apoE isoforms regulate miR221/222 , and the effect is independent of the C-terminal lipid-binding domain. miR221/222 levels are increased in the aortae of apoE3-null mice and reduced when apoE3 expression is reconstituted by adeno-associated virus infection .	
23294923_s7	Thus , regulation of miR221/222 by apoE3 occurs invivo as well as invitro .	
23294923_s8	CONCLUSIONS ApoE inhibits VSMC proliferation by regulating p27 through miR221/222 .	
23294923_s9	Control of cell cycle-regulatory microRNAs adds a new dimension to the spectrum of cardiovascular protective effects afforded by apoE and apoE-HDL .	
23298485_s0	Protein kinase B ( AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the tumorigenesis and progression of multiple tumors , and has been shown to be important therapeutic targets for cancer .	
23298485_s1	The present study aimed to explore the role and molecular mechanisms of AKT/mTOR pathway in human hemangioma ( HA ) .	
23298485_s2	Twenty-five cases of human HA tissues were collected .	
23298485_s3	The expression of AKT , mTOR and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) proteins was evaluated using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry in biopsy samples in different phases of HA .	
23298485_s4	AKT/mTOR pathway was blocked by recombinant small hairpin RNA adenovirus vector rAd5-AKT+mTOR ( rAd5-Am ) , used for infecting proliferating phase HA-derived endothelial cells ( HDEC ) .	
23298485_s5	The expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA was detected by Real-time PCR and Western blot assays .	
23298485_s6	Cell proliferative activities were determined by MTT assay , and cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry .	
23298485_s7	As a consequence , the expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA was significantly increased in proliferative phase HA , while that was decreased in involutive phase .	
23298485_s8	Combined blockade of AKT/mTOR pathway by rAd5-Am diminished cell proliferative activities , and induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest with the decreased expression of AKT , mTOR and PCNA in proliferative phase HDEC .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23298485_s9	In conclusion , the activity of AKT/mTOR pathway was increased in proliferative phase HA , while it was decreased in involutive phase .	
23298485_s10	Combined blockade of AKT/mTOR pathway might suppress cell proliferation via down-regulation of PCNA expression , and induce apoptosis and cycle arrest in proliferative phase HDEC , suggesting that AKT/mTOR pathway might represent the important therapeutic targets for human HA .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23300545_s0	Approximately half of all HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer patients do not respond to trastuzumab-containing therapy .	
23300545_s1	Therefore , there remains an urgent and unmet clinical need for the development of predictive biomarkers for trastuzumab response .	
23300545_s2	Recently , several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the inflammatory tumor microenvironment is a major contributor to therapy resistance in breast cancer .	
23300545_s3	In order to explore the predictive value of inflammation in breast cancer patients , we measured the inflammatory biomarkers serum ferritin and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) in 66 patients immediately before undergoing trastuzumab-containing therapy and evaluated their progression-free and overall survival .	
23300545_s4	The elevation in pre-treatment serum ferritin ( &gt;250 ng/ml ) or CRP ( &gt;7.25 mg/l ) was a significant predictor of reduced progression-free survival and shorter overall survival .	
23300545_s5	When patients were stratified based on their serum ferritin and CRP levels , patients with elevation in both inflammatory biomarkers had a markedly poorer response to trastuzumab-containing therapy .	tumor promoting inflammation
23300545_s6	Therefore , the elevation in inflammatory serum biomarkers may reflect a pathological state that decreases the clinical efficacy of this therapy .	tumor promoting inflammation
23300545_s7	Anti-inflammatory drugs and life-style changes to decrease inflammation in cancer patients should be explored as possible strategies to sensitize patients to anti-cancer therapeutics .	tumor promoting inflammation
23300567_s0	Nuclear factor kappa-B ( NF-ÎºB ) activates multiple genes with overlapping roles in cell proliferation , inflammation and cancer .	
23300567_s1	Using an unbiased approach we identified human CDK6 as a novel kinase phosphorylating NF-ÎºB p65 at serine 536 .	
23300567_s2	Purified and reconstituted CDK6/cyclin complexes phosphorylated p65 in vitro and in transfected cells .	
23300567_s3	The physiological role of CDK6 for basal as well as cytokine-induced p65 phosphorylation or NF-ÎºB activation was revealed upon RNAi-mediated suppression of CDK6 .	
23300567_s4	Inhibition of CDK6 catalytic activity by PD332991 suppressed activation of NF-ÎºB and TNF-induced gene expression .	
23300567_s5	In complex with a constitutively active viral cyclin CDK6 stimulated NF-ÎºB p65-mediated transcription in a target gene specific manner and this effect was partially dependent on its ability to phosphorylate p65 at serine 536 .	
23300567_s6	Tumor formation in thymi and spleens of v-cyclin transgenic mice correlated with increased levels of p65 Ser536 phosphorylation , increased expression of CDK6 and upregulaton of the NF-ÎºB target cyclin D3 .	
23300567_s7	These results suggest that aberrant CDK6 expression or activation that is frequently observed in human tumors can contribute through NF-ÎºB to chronic inflammation and neoplasia .	tumor promoting inflammation
23300633_s0	Angiogenesis , the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vascular beds , is essential for tumor growth , invasion , and metastasis .	
23300633_s1	Luteolin is a common dietary flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables .	
23300633_s2	We studied the antiangiogenic activity of luteolin using in vitro , ex vivo , and in vivo models .	
23300633_s3	In vitro studies using rat aortic ring assay showed that luteolin at non-toxic concentrations significantly inhibited microvessel sprouting and proliferation , migration , invasion and tube formation of endothelial cells , which are key events in the process of angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
23300633_s4	Luteolin also inhibited ex vivo angiogenesis as revealed by chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane assay ( CAM ) and matrigel plug assay .	inducing angiogenesis
23300633_s5	Gelatin zymographic analysis demonstrated the inhibitory effect of luteolin on the activation of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 .	
23300633_s6	Western blot analysis showed that luteolin suppressed VEGF induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 and their downstream protein kinases AKT , ERK , mTOR , P70S6K , MMP-2 , and MMP-9 in HUVECs .	
23300633_s7	Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Î² , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF-Î± level were significantly reduced by the treatment of luteolin in PC-3 cells .	
23300633_s8	Luteolin ( 10 mg/kg/d ) significantly reduced the volume and the weight of solid tumors in prostate xenograft mouse model , indicating that luteolin inhibited tumorigenesis by targeting angiogenesis .	
23300633_s9	CD31 and CD34 immunohistochemical staining further revealed that the microvessel density could be remarkably suppressed by luteolin .	inducing angiogenesis
23300633_s10	Moreover , luteolin reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells , which were correlated with the downregulation of AKT , ERK , mTOR , P70S6K , MMP-2 , and MMP-9 expressions .	resisting cell death
23300633_s11	Taken together , our findings demonstrate that luteolin inhibits human prostate tumor growth by suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-mediated angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
23300781_s0	Tumors are infiltrated by macrophages , T and B-lymphocytes , which may favor tumor development by promoting angiogenesis , growth and invasion .	
23300781_s1	The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of the relative amount of macrophages ( CD68âº ) , T-cells ( CD3âº and B-cells ( CD20âº ) at the invasive front of breast carcinomas , and the expression of matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) and their inhibitors ( TIMPs ) either at the invasive front or at the tumor center .	
23300781_s2	We performed an immunohistochemical study counting CD3 , CD20 and CD68 positive cells at the invasive front , in 102 breast carcinomas .	
23300781_s3	Also , tissue sections were stained with MMP-2 , -9 , -11 , -14 and TIMP-2 antibodies , and immunoreactivity location , percentage of reactive area and intensity were determined at the invasive front and at the tumor center .	
23300781_s4	The results showed that an increased CD68 count and CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio were directly associated with both MMP-11 and TIMP-2 expression by mononuclear inflammatory cells at the tumor center ( pâ=â0.041 and pâ=â0.025 for CD68 count and pâ=â0.001 and pâ=â0.045 for ratio , respectively for MMP-11 and TIMP-2 ) .	avoiding immune destruction,tumor promoting inflammation
23300781_s5	In addition , a high CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio ( &gt;0.05 ) was directly associated with a higher probability of shortened relapse-free survival .	
23300781_s6	Multivariate analysis revealed that CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio was an independent factor associated with distant relapse-free survival ( RR : 2.54 , CI : ( 1.23-5.24 ) , p&lt;0.01 ) .	
23300781_s7	Therefore , CD68/(CD3+CD20) ratio at the invasive front could be used as an important prognostic marker .	
23300791_s0	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world .	
23300791_s1	Achaete-scute complex homolog-1 ( Ascl1 ) is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ) transcription factor family that has multiple functions in the normal and neoplastic lung such as the regulation of neuroendocrine differentiation , prevention of apoptosis and promotion of tumor-initiating cells .	
23300791_s2	We now show that Ascl1 directly regulates matrix metalloproteinase-7 ( MMP-7 ) and O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) .	
23300791_s3	Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in human bronchial epithelial and lung carcinoma cell lines revealed that Ascl1 , MMP-7 and MGMT are able to protect cells from the tobacco-specific nitrosamine NNK-induced DNA damage and the alkylating agent cisplatin-induced apoptosis .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
23300791_s4	We also examined the role of Ascl1 in NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis in vivo .	
23300791_s5	Using transgenic mice which constitutively expressed human Ascl1 in airway lining cells , we found that there was a delay in lung tumorigenesis .	
23300791_s6	We conclude that Ascl1 potentially enhances DNA repair through activation of MMP-7 and MGMT which may impact lung carcinogenesis and chemoresistance .	genomic instability and mutation
23300791_s7	The study has uncovered a novel and unexpected function of Ascl1 which will contribute to better understanding of lung carcinogenesis and the broad implications of transcription factors in tobacco-related carcinogenesis .	
23300887_s0	Novel strategies are necessary to improve chemotherapy response in advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer .	
23300887_s1	Here , we demonstrate that terpenoids present in the Steam Distilled Extract of Ginger ( SDGE ) are potent inhibitors of proliferation of endometrial cancer cells .	
23300887_s2	SDGE , isolated from six different batches of ginger rhizomes , consistently inhibited proliferation of the endometrial cancer cell lines Ishikawa and ECC-1 at IC(50) of 1.25 ï¿½g/ml .	
23300887_s3	SDGE also enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of radiation and cisplatin .	
23300887_s4	Decreased proliferation of Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells was a direct result of SDGE-induced apoptosis as demonstrated by FITC-Annexin V staining and expression of cleaved caspase 3 .	resisting cell death
23300887_s5	GC/MS analysis identified a total of 22 different terpenoid compounds in SDGE , with the isomers neral and geranial constituting 30-40% .	
23300887_s6	Citral , a mixture of neral and geranial inhibited the proliferation of Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells at an IC(50) 10 ï¿½M ( 2.3 ï¿½g/ml ) .	
23300887_s7	Phenolic compounds such as gingerol and shogaol were not detected in SDGE and 6-gingerol was a weaker inhibitor of the proliferation of the endometrial cancer cells .	
23300887_s8	SDGE was more effective in inducing cancer cell death than citral , suggesting that other terpenes present in SDGE were also contributing to endometrial cancer cell death .	resisting cell death
23300887_s9	SDGE treatment resulted in a rapid and strong increase in intracellular calcium and a 20-40% decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential .	
23300887_s10	Ser-15 of p53 was phosphorylated after 15 min treatment of the cancer cells with SDGE .	
23300887_s11	This increase in p53 was associated with 90% decrease in Bcl2 whereas no effect was observed on Bax .	resisting cell death
23300887_s12	Inhibitor of p53 , pifithrin-Î± , attenuated the anti-cancer effects of SDGE and apoptosis was also not observed in the p53(neg) SKOV-3 cells .	resisting cell death
23300887_s13	Our studies demonstrate that terpenoids from SDGE mediate apoptosis by activating p53 and should be therefore be investigated as agents for the treatment of endometrial cancer .	resisting cell death
23304206_s0	Retinoic acid ( RA ) has been believed to be an anticancer drug for a long history .	
23304206_s1	However , the molecular mechanisms of RA actions on cancer cells remain diverse .	
23304206_s2	In this study , the dose-dependent inhibition of RA on DU145 cell proliferation was identified .	
23304206_s3	Interestingly , RA treatment triggered p35 cleavage ( p25 formation ) and Cdk5 overactivation , and all could be blocked by Calpain inhibitor , Calpeptin ( CP ) .	
23304206_s4	Subsequently , RA-triggered DU145 apoptosis detected by sub-G1 phase accumulation and Annexin V staining could also be blocked by CP treatment .	resisting cell death
23304206_s5	Furthermore , RA-triggered caspase 3 activation and following Cdk5 over-activation were destroyed by treatments of both CP and Cdk5 knockdown .	resisting cell death
23304206_s6	In conclusion , we report a new mechanism in which RA could cause apoptosis of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells through p35 cleavage and Cdk5 over-activation .	resisting cell death
23304206_s7	This finding may contribute to constructing a clearer image of RA function and bring RA as a valuable chemoprevention agent for prostate cancer patients .	
23304253_s0	Background .	
23304253_s1	Multiple myeloma ( MM ) , an almost incurable disease , is the second most common blood cancer .	
23304253_s2	Initial chemotherapeutic treatment could be successful ; however , resistance development urges the use of higher toxic doses accompanied by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation .	
23304253_s3	The establishment of more effective treatments that can overcome or circumvent chemoresistance has become a priority .	
23304253_s4	We recently demonstrated that venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia ( WEV ) either alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles ( WEV+NPs ) mediated the growth arrest and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells .	
23304253_s5	In the present study , we evaluated the impact of WEV alone and WEV+NP on proliferation and apoptosis of MM cells .	
23304253_s6	Methods .	
23304253_s7	The impacts of WEV alone and WEV+NP were monitored in MM cells from 70 diagnosed patients .	
23304253_s8	The influences of WEV and WEV+NP were assessed with flow cytometry analysis .	
23304253_s9	Results .	
23304253_s10	WEV alone and WEV+NP decreased the viability of MM cells .	
23304253_s11	Using a CFSE proliferation assay , we found that WEV+NP strongly inhibited MM cell proliferation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23304253_s12	Furthermore , analysis of the cell cycle using the propidium iodide ( PI ) staining method indicated that WEV+NP strongly altered the cell cycle of MM cells and enhanced the induction of apoptosis .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23304253_s13	Conclusions .	
23304253_s14	Our data reveal the biological effects of WEV and WEV+NP on MM cells that enable these compounds to function as effective treatments for MM .	
23304558_s0	Background and Objective .	
23304558_s1	The cell cycle is regulated by proteins at different checkpoints , and dysregulation of this cycle plays a role in carcinogenesis .	
23304558_s2	Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are enzymes that degrade collagen and promote tumour infiltration .	
23304558_s3	The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of various cell cycle regulators and MMPs and to correlate such expression with progression and recurrence in patients with stage T1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder ( UCB ) .	
23304558_s4	Patients and Methods .	
23304558_s5	This population-based cohort study comprised 201 well-characterized patients with primary stage T1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder .	
23304558_s6	Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed material to quantify expression of cell cycle regulators and two MMPs .	
23304558_s7	Results .	
23304558_s8	Normal expression of p53 and abnormal expression of MMP9 were associated with greater risk of tumour recurrence .	
23304558_s9	Also , normal p16 expression was related to a lower risk of tumour progression .	evading growth suppressors
23304558_s10	MMP2 , p21 , cyclin D1 , and pRb showed no significant results that could estimate progression or recurrence .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23304558_s11	Conclusions .	
23304558_s12	Normal p16 expression is associated with a lower risk of tumour progression , but immunohistochemistry on cell cycle regulators and MMPs has little value in predicting the prognosis in stage T1 UCB .	evading growth suppressors
23308053_s0	The expression of the angiogenic phenotype is regulated by a balance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors released into the tumor microenvironment .	
23308053_s1	Nuclear protein 7 ( NOL7 ) , a novel tumor suppressor , acts as a master regulator of angiogenesis by downregulating pro-angiogenic factors and upregulating anti-angiogenic factors .	
23308053_s2	Using cervical cancer as a model of investigation , we have previously shown that loss of NOL7 mRNA and protein expression is observed as early as the premalignant phase .	
23308053_s3	Analysis of the gene failed to identify tumor-specific promoter methylation or coding region mutations , suggesting that NOL7 loss may be mediated by aberrant expression of its upstream regulators .	
23308053_s4	In this study , we show that the RB tumor suppressor gene ( RB ) positively regulates NOL7 at the transcriptional level by recruiting transcription factors and transcription machinery proteins to its promoter region .	
23308053_s5	Conversely , the loss of RB represses NOL7 transcription by inhibiting assembly of these proteins .	
23308053_s6	This loss of NOL7 expression is also observed in RB-deficient human malignancies .	
23308053_s7	Together , this work further characterizes the transcriptional activator function of RB and defines a potential role for RB in regulating angiogenesis through activation of NOL7 .	inducing angiogenesis
23308053_s8	Current anti-angiogenic therapies lack long-term efficacy , as they are unable to target the diverse angiogenic signals generated by tumors .	
23308053_s9	Our data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that reactivation of pRB can potentially modulate the expression of the angiogenic phenotype through regulation of NOL7 .	inducing angiogenesis
23308053_s10	Therefore , this knowledge may be employed to design more comprehensive and effective therapies .	
23317208_s0	OBJECTIVE The aim of this retrospective study is to analyze the clinical and pathological factors related to the prognosis of Chinese patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer .	
23317208_s1	METHODS AND RESULTS 13 clinical pathological factors in 255 patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer undergoing radical hysterectomy and systematic lymphadenectomy were analyzed to screen for factors related to prognosis .	
23317208_s2	The cumulative 5-year survival of the 255 patients was 75.7% .	
23317208_s3	The result of the univariate analysis suggested that clinical stage , cell differentiation , depth of cervical stromal invasion , parametrial tissue involvement , and lymph node metastasis were prognostic factors for patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23317208_s4	Compared with cases with involvement of iliac nodes , obturator nodes , or inguinal lymph nodes , cases with metastasis to the common iliac lymph nodes had a poorer prognosis ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23317208_s5	Cases with involvement of four or more lymph nodes had a poorer prognosis than those with involvement of three or fewer lymph nodes ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	
23317208_s6	Using multivariate Cox proportional hazards model regression analysis , non-squamous histological type , poor differentiation , parametrial tissue involvement , and outer 1/3 stromal invasion were found to be independently related to patients poor prognosis ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23317208_s7	CONCLUSION Non-squamous histological type , poor cell differentiation , parametrial tissue involvement , and outer 1/3 stromal invasion are the independent poor prognostic factors for patients with stage Ib to IIb cervical cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis
23317220_s0	Onions ( Allium cepa L. ) are widely used in the food industry for its nutritional and aromatic properties .	
23317220_s1	Our studies showed that ethyl acetate extract of onion ( EEO ) had potent inhibitory effects on animal fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) , and could induce apoptosis in FAS over-expressing human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells .	resisting cell death
23317220_s2	Furthermore , this apoptosis was accompanied by reduction of intracellular FAS activity and could be rescued by 25 mM or 50 mM exogenous palmitic acids , the final product of FAS catalyzed synthesis .	resisting cell death
23317220_s3	These results suggest that the apoptosis induced by EEO occurs via inhibition of FAS .	resisting cell death
23317220_s4	We also found that EEO could suppress lipid accumulation during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes , which was also related to its inhibition of intracellular FAS activity .	
23317220_s5	Since obesity is closely related to breast cancer and obese patients are at elevated risk of developing various cancers , these findings suggested that onion might be useful for preventing obesity-related malignancy .	
23317259_s0	Family with sequence similarity 189 , member B ( FAM189B ) , alias COTE1 , a putative oncogene selected by microarray , for the first time was here found to be significantly up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) specimens and HCC cell lines. mRNA expression of COTE1 in HCC samples and cell lines was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and real-time PCR , while protein expression of COTE1 in HCC tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry .	
23317259_s1	In addition , invasion of HCC cells was observed after overexpressing or silencing COTE1 .	activating invasion and metastasis
23317259_s2	In the total of 48 paired HCC specimens , compared with the adjacent non-cancer tissues , the expression of COTE1 was up-regulated in 31 ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	
23317259_s3	In HCC cell lines , COTE1 expression was significantly higher than in normal human adult liver ( p&lt;0.01 ) .	
23317259_s4	Overexpression of COTE1 enhanced HCC-derived LM6 and MHCC-L cellular invasion in vitro .	activating invasion and metastasis
23317259_s5	In contrast , COTE1 knockdown via RNAi markedly suppressed these phenotypes , as documented in LM3 and MHCC-H HCC cells .	
23317259_s6	Mechanistic analyses indicated that COTE1 could physically associate with WW domain oxidoreductase ( WWOX ) , a tumor suppressor .	
23317259_s7	COTE1 may be closely correlated with invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells and thus may serve as an effective target for gene therapy .	activating invasion and metastasis
23317266_s0	Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the world and is one of the leading causes of death due to cancer .	
23317266_s1	Health benefits have been linked to additive and synergistic combinations of phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables .	
23317266_s2	Nigella sativa has been shown to possess anti-carcinogenic activity , inhibiting growth of several cancer cell lines in vitro .	
23317266_s3	However , the molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer properties of Nigella sativa phytochemical extracts have not been completely understood .	
23317266_s4	Our data showed that Nigella sativa extracts significantly inhibited human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation at doses of 2.5-5 Î¼g/mL ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23317266_s5	Apoptotic induction in MDA-MB-231 cells was observed in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to Nigella sativa extracts for 48 h .	resisting cell death
23317266_s6	Real time PCR and flow cytometry analyses suggested that Nigella sativa extracts possess the ability to suppress the proliferation of human breast cancer cells through induction of apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23320038_s0	Momordica charantia has been found to exhibit anticancer activity , in addition to its well-known therapeutic functions .	
23320038_s1	We have demonstrated that the leaf extract of Momordica charantia ( MCME ) induces apoptosis in several human cancer cells through caspase- and mitochondria-dependent pathways .	
23320038_s2	In this study , a different susceptibility to MCME was found in human lung adenocarcinoma CL1 cells with different metastatic ability , leading to the significant difference of cell viability and invasiveness between MCME-treated CL1-0 and CL1-5 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23320038_s3	MCME was found to upregulate the expression of Wnt-2 and affect the migratory and invasive ability of CL1 cells through suppressed MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymatic activities .	activating invasion and metastasis
23320038_s4	We proposed that MCME mediates inhibition against migration of CL1 cells by reducing the expression and activation of Src and FAK to decrease the expression of downstream Akt , Î²-catenin , and MMPs .	activating invasion and metastasis
23321169_s0	OBJECTIVE The signalling molecule protein kinase B ( Akt ) modulates many cellular processes .	
23321169_s1	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K)/Akt signalling pathways play important roles in tumour angiogenesis .	
23321169_s2	The aim of this study was to determine the role of phosphorylated Akt ( pAkt ) in angiogenesis and its correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-A in gastric adenocarcinoma .	
23321169_s3	METHODS Tumour tissue and matched healthy gastric mucosa were obtained from patients undergoing surgical resection of gastric adenocarcinoma .	
23321169_s4	Akt and pAkt were detected via Western blotting .	
23321169_s5	VEGF-A , pAkt and CD34 were examined by immunohistochemistry .	
23321169_s6	RESULTS Akt and pAkt protein levels were significantly higher in gastric cancer tissue than in normal tissue ( n = 48 patients ) .	
23321169_s7	Positive VEGF-A immunostaining was significantly associated with pAkt immunostaining .	inducing angiogenesis
23321169_s8	Microvessel density was correlated with both VEGF-A and pAkt positivity .	inducing angiogenesis
23321169_s9	CONCLUSIONS Phosphorylated Akt and VEGF-A are involved in angiogenesis of gastric adenocarcinoma , and Akt activation may contribute to angiogenesis via VEGF-A upregulation .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23321169_s10	The PI3K/Akt/VEGF signalling pathway may be involved in gastric adeno carcinoma .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23327050_s0	This study aimed to observe the effects of octreotide ( OCT ) on cisplatin resistance reversal of cancer cells in vitro and in nude mice in vivo .	
23327050_s1	MTT method and flow cytometry were used to investigate the effect of cisplatin , OCT or the combination of these two compounds on the proliferation and apoptosis of SKOV3-DDP cells .	
23327050_s2	The size and weight of xenograft tumors from the nude mice model were measured .	
23327050_s3	Real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of SSTR2 , MDR1 , MRP2 , GST-pi and EGFR in SKOV3/DDP cells following the different treatment .	
23327050_s4	At the concentration of 2.5-20 g/ml , OCT significantly reduced IC50 ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) and promoted apoptosis ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) of SKOV3-DDP cells ' response to cisplatin .	resisting cell death
23327050_s5	Unchanged expression was found in SSTR2 on the SKOV3/DDP cell in vitro after OCT treatment , but increased expression in vivo ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
23327050_s6	OCT increased GST-pi expression ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) and reduced MRP2 and EGFR expression ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) in a dose-dependent manner .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23327050_s7	The similar results were obtained in mice in vivo experiment , except the reduced expression of GST-pi .	
23327050_s8	It is suggested that OCT could inhibit ovarian cancer proliferation and promote apoptosis , via the cell surface SSTR2 , and reverse cisplatin resistance through inhibition of MRP2 , EGFR , and even GST-pi expressions .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23342249_s0	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a critical process providing tumor cells with the ability to migrate and escape from the primary tumor and metastasize to distant sites .	
23342249_s1	Recently , EMT was shown to be associated with the cancer stem cell ( CSC ) phenotype in breast cancer .	
23342249_s2	Snail is a transcription factor that mediates EMT in a number of tumor types , including colorectal cancer ( CRC ) .	
23342249_s3	Our study was done to determine the role of Snail in mediating EMT and CSC function in CRC .	
23342249_s4	Human CRC specimens were stained for Snail expression , and human CRC cell lines were transduced with a retroviral Snail construct or vector control .	
23342249_s5	Cell proliferation and chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin of the infected cells were determined by the MTT ( colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ) assay .	
23342249_s6	Migration and invasion were determined in vitro using modified Boyden chamber assays .	
23342249_s7	EMT and putative CSC markers were analyzed using Western blotting .	
23342249_s8	Intravenous injection of tumor cells was done to evaluate their metastatic potential in mice .	
23342249_s9	Snail was overexpressed in human CRC surgical specimens .	
23342249_s10	This overexpression induced EMT and a CSC-like phenotype in human CRC cells and enhanced cell migration and invasion ( P &lt ; 0.002 vs. control ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23342249_s11	Snail overexpression also led to an increase in metastasis formation in vivo ( P &lt ; 0.002 vs. control ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23342249_s12	Furthermore , the Snail-overexpressing CRC cells were more chemoresistant to oxaliplatin than control cells .	
23342249_s13	Increased Snail expression induces EMT and the CSC-like phenotype in CRC cells , which enhance cancer cell invasion and chemoresistance .	activating invasion and metastasis
23342249_s14	Thus , Snail is a potential therapeutic target in metastatic CRC .	activating invasion and metastasis
23346016_s0	The purpose of the study was to evaluate Sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) derived receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition on tumor progression in murine islet cell tumors .	
23346016_s1	Sorafenib is considered to be a potent inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and neovascularization in various solid tumors .	
23346016_s2	Rip1Tag2 mice were treated in two different groups according to the model of tumor progression : the early treatment group received vehicle or Sorafenib from 10 to 14 weeks of age and the late treatment group from week 12 until death .	
23346016_s3	Tumor surface , tumor cell proliferation , and apoptosis were measured in both treatment groups to assess the in vivo effects of Sorafenib .	
23346016_s4	Survival was recorded for the late treatment group .	
23346016_s5	In the early treatment group Sorafenib led to a dramatic decrease in tumor volume compared to the control group .	
23346016_s6	Apoptosis was significantly augmented and cell proliferation was inhibited .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23346016_s7	As a single therapy Sorafenib significantly improved survival in the late treatment group .	
23346016_s8	Conclusion .	
23346016_s9	Sorafenib may provide a new paradigm for the therapy of islet cell tumors .	
23359693_s0	The Hippo signaling pathway inhibits cell growth and regulates organ size through a kinase cascade that leads to the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the growth-promoting transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein ( YAP)/Yorkie .	
23359693_s1	It mediates contact inhibition of cell growth downstream of cadherin adhesion molecules and other cell surface proteins .	
23359693_s2	Contact inhibition is often antagonized by mitogenic growth factor signaling .	
23359693_s3	We report an important mechanism for this antagonism , inhibition of Hippo pathway signaling by mitogenic growth factors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23359693_s4	EGF treatment of immortalized mammary cells triggers the rapid translocation of YAP into the nucleus along with YAP dephosphorylation , both of which depend on Lats , the terminal kinase in the Hippo pathway .	
23359693_s5	A small-molecule inhibitor screen of downstream effector pathways shows that EGF receptor inhibits the Hippo pathway through activation of PI3-kinase ( PI3K ) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase ( PDK1 ) , but independent of AKT activity .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23359693_s6	The PI3K-PDK1 pathway also mediates YAP nuclear translocation downstream of lysophosphatidic acid and serum as a result of constitutive oncogenic activation of PI3K .	
23359693_s7	PDK1 associates with the core Hippo pathway-kinase complex through the scaffold protein Salvador .	
23359693_s8	The entire Hippo core complex dissociates in response to EGF signaling in a PI3K-PDK1-dependent manner , leading to inactivation of Lats , dephosphorylation of YAP , and YAP nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activation of its target gene , CTGF .	
23359693_s9	These findings show that an important activity of mitogenic signaling pathways is to inactivate the growth-inhibitory Hippo pathway and provide a mechanism for antagonism between contact inhibition and growth factor action .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23359979_s0	OBJECTIVE To observe the anti-tumor recurrent and metastatic efficacy of Ru'ai Shuhou Recipe ( RSR ) on HER2 positive breast cancer , to evaluate the effects of RSR on the expressions of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) in the recurrence and metastasis of HER2 positive breast cancer , thus revealing its anti-tumor recurrent and metastatic mechanisms .	
23359979_s1	METHODS Selected were 30-week-old HER2/neu transgenic spontaneous breast cancer mice FVB/neu .	
23359979_s2	The primary tumor resection was carried out .	
23359979_s3	After surgery they were randomly divided into the blank control group , the RSR group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group ( RSR + Herceptin group ) .	
23359979_s4	The treatment lasted for 4 months .	
23359979_s5	The inhibition rate of the recurrent tumor volume and the inhibition rate of the lung metastasis were evaluated .	
23359979_s6	The expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) , matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase ( TIMP-1 ) , and TIMP-2 in the recurrent tumor tissue were detected using Western blot .	
23359979_s7	RESULTS By the end of the treatment the average recurrent tumor volume was 11.11 +/- 8.71 cm3 in the blank control group and 5.56 +/- 5.55 cm3 of the RSR group , showing statistical difference between the two groups ( P = 0.037 ) .	
23359979_s8	The average lung metastatic nodule was 16 in the blank control group and 10 in the RSR group .	activating invasion and metastasis
23359979_s9	The inhibition rate of lung metastasis was 37. 85% in the RSR group , but with no statistical significance .	activating invasion and metastasis
23359979_s10	The expression level of activated MMP-2 in the RSR group was down-regulated when compared with the blank control group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
23359979_s11	The expression of MMP-9 of the RSR group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group was significantly down-regulated when compared with the blank control group ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
23359979_s12	The expression of MMP-9 of the RSR group and the combination group was further down-regulated when compared with the Herceptin group ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
23359979_s13	The expressions of both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 of the RSR group , the Herceptin group , and the combination group were all up-regulated when compared with the blank control group ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
23359979_s14	The increased expression of TIMP-1 was more significantly in the RSR group and the combination group when compared with the Herceptin group ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
23359979_s15	It was higher in the combination group than in the RSR group ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
23359979_s16	CONCLUSIONS RSR could inhibit the tumor recurrence of FVB/neu mice .	
23359979_s17	It could reduce the degradation of extracellular matrix and increase the protective effects of extracellular matrix .	
23359979_s18	It might achieve its anti-tumor effect through effecting the invasive and metastatic capabilities of breast tumor cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23364257_s0	Bcl-2/E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 ( BNIP3 ) is a proapoptotic protein whose expression level is often low in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) cells due to the BNIP3 gene promoter DNA methylation by DNA methyltransferase ( DNMT ) .	
23364257_s1	It is known that chemotherapy and radiotherapy suppress CRC through inducing tumor apoptosis .	
23364257_s2	However , the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced apoptosis of CRC cells are not well defined .	
23364257_s3	In this study , we observed that the expression level of BNIP3 in colon cancer cells was significantly increased by treatment with therapeutic agents and radiation in vitro .	
23364257_s4	The BNIP3 protein level in CRC tissues from patients who received preoperative concurrent chemotherapy was significantly higher than in those who received surgery alone .	
23364257_s5	Furthermore , treatment with chemotherapeutic agents and radiation significantly decreased the DNMT1 expression level and enzymatic activity .	
23364257_s6	Both expression level and activity of DNMT1 were inversely correlated with the expression level of BNIP3 in colon carcinoma cells after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents and radiation .	
23364257_s7	Consistent with increased BNIP3 expression , chemotherapeutic agents and radiation induced colon carcinoma cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner .	resisting cell death
23364257_s8	Based on these observations , we conclude that chemotherapy and radiotherapy inhibit DNMT1 expression to upregulate BNIP3 expression to promote CRC cell apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23364257_s9	And , BNIP3 may play a role in the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathways , mainly during treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .	resisting cell death
23367225_s0	The new concept of keeping primary tumor under control in situ to suppress distant foci sheds light on the novel treatment of metastatic tumor .	
23367225_s1	Hyperthermia is considered as one of the means for controlling tumor growth .	
23367225_s2	In this study , a novel thermal modality was built to introduce hyperthermia effect on tumor to suppress its growth and progression using 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma , a common animal model of metastatic breast cancer .	
23367225_s3	A mildly raised temperature ( i.e.39ï¿½C ) was imposed on the skin surface of the implanted tumor using a thermal heating pad .	
23367225_s4	Periodic heating ( 12 hours per day ) was carried out for 3 days , 7 days , 14 days , and 21 days , respectively .	
23367225_s5	The tumor growth rate was found significantly decreased in comparison to the control without hyperthermia .	
23367225_s6	Biological evidences associated with tumor angiogenesis and metastasis were examined using histological analyses .	
23367225_s7	Accordingly , the effect of mild hyperthermia on immune cell infiltration into tumors was also investigated .	
23367225_s8	It was demonstrated that a delayed tumor growth and malignancy progression was achieved by mediating tumor cell apoptosis , vascular injury , degrading metastasis potential and as well as inhibiting the immunosuppressive cell myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) recruitment .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction,resisting cell death
23367225_s9	Further mechanistic studies will be performed to explore the quantitative relationship between tumor progression and thermal dose in the near future .	
23379414_s0	UNLABELLED BACKGROUND Cell lines are very useful for clinical and basic research .	
23379414_s1	Thus far , only 11 reports have documented the characteristics of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell lines in the literature .	
23379414_s2	Due to the scarcity of information , the establishment of an ovarian malignant tumor cell line with distinctive characteristics is particularly important to study this disease .	
23379414_s3	Thus , this study was undertaken to establish and characterize a new human endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line of the ovary .	
23379414_s4	METHODS The cell line NOMH-1 was established from an ovarian tumor of a 44-year-old woman .	
23379414_s5	Features of the cell line studied included morphology , chromosome analysis , heterotransplantation , tumor markers , and chemosensitivity .	
23379414_s6	RESULTS This cell line has been growing well for 232 months and subcultured more than 50 times .	
23379414_s7	Monolayer cultured cells were polygonal in shape , showing a pavement-like arrangement and a tendency to stack without contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
23379414_s8	They exhibited a human karyotype with a modal chromosomal number in the hypertriploid range .	
23379414_s9	The cells could be transplanted into the subcutis of nude mice and produced tumors resembling the original tumor .	
23379414_s10	NOMH-1 cells expressed both CEA and CA19-9 which were identified immunohistochemically in the original tumor and the heterotransplanted tumor .	
23379414_s11	The cells were sensitive to paclitaxel , an agent commonly used in the treatment of gynecological cancers .	
23379414_s12	CONCLUSIONS NOMH-1 is the first ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line in which CEA and CA19-9 expression have been defined .	
23379414_s13	This newly established cell line should be useful for investigating the characteristics of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma .	
23383661_s0	The effects of genomic changes in hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) on the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) are still unclear , especially in relation to the genotype of HBV .	
23383661_s1	In this study , we examined the effects of genomic changes in HBV of genotype C2 on the development of HCC .	
23383661_s2	A total of 318 patients with HBV-associated HCC and 234 patients with chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) were studied .	
23383661_s3	All of HCC cases were diagnosed histologically and treated with surgical resection .	
23383661_s4	The whole of the X , S , basal core promoter ( BCP ) and precore regions of the viral genome from sera or liver tissues were sequenced .	
23383661_s5	All subjects had HBV of genotype C2 .	
23383661_s6	The prevalence of the T1653 mutation in the X region and the A1896 mutation in the precore region of HBV was significantly higher in the HCC group than in the control CHB group ( 22% vs 11% , P = 0.003 ; 50% vs 23% , P &lt ; 0.001 , respectively ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23383661_s7	Moreover , the T1762/A1764 mutations in the BCP region in combination with either T1653 or A1896 were more common in the HCC compared with the CHB group ( BCP+X1653 : 18% vs 11% , P = 0.05 ; BCP+PC , 40% vs 15% , P &lt ; 0.001 , respectively ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23383661_s8	In multivariate analysis , T1653 and A1896 were revealed to be independent risk factors for HCC development .	
23383661_s9	G1896A in the precore region and C1653T mutation in the X region of genotype C2 HBV are important risk factors for HCC development .	genomic instability and mutation
23383661_s10	Also , the A1762T/G1764A double mutation may act in synergy with C1653T to increase the risk of HCC in patients chronically infected with HBV genotype C2 .	genomic instability and mutation
23386005_s0	OBJECTIVE This study describes a new method used in the clinical laboratory at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein to detect mutations in exons 8 and 17 of the KIT gene in patients with acute myeloid leukemia .	
23386005_s1	METHODS Genomic DNA extraction was performed on 54 samples of peripheral blood or bone marrow from patients with acute myeloid leukemia .	
23386005_s2	The extracted DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced , and the fragments were analyzed .	
23386005_s3	RESULTS Within the analyzed samples , we detected four mutations in exon 8 , two mutations in exon 17 , and mutations or a double mutation in one sample .	genomic instability and mutation
23386005_s4	CONCLUSION The tests detecting mutations in exon 8 and 17 on the KIT gene were successfully standardized .	genomic instability and mutation
23386005_s5	The test is now included among the routine diagnostics employed for patients at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein clinical laboratory .	
23394443_s0	In the present study , post-treatment effects of dietary turmeric on markers related to apoptosis , cell proliferation , and inflammation in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene ( DMBA)-induced hamster buccal pouch ( HBP ) tumors were investigated .	
23394443_s1	Tumors were induced by applying 0.5% DMBA topically to the HBP three times per week for 12 weeks .	
23394443_s2	After tumor development , half of the animals continued on the control diet and the other half were shifted to a 1% turmeric diet for 4 weeks .	
23394443_s3	To rule out DMBA discontinuation as a cause of inhibition in tumor growth , DMBA treatment was continued during dietary exposure of turmeric in another set of animals until the end of the experiment .	
23394443_s4	The turmeric diet inhibited tumor growth in animals with or without DMBA carcinogen treatment compared to the animals on the control diet .	
23394443_s5	When compared to hamsters bearing tumors that remained on the control diet , the buccal pouches of hamsters bearing tumors receiving turmeric showed the following results : ( 1 ) decreased cell proliferation ( diminished PCNA , cyclin D1 , and Bcl-2 ) and PCNA labelling index , ( 2 ) enhanced apoptosis ( increased Bax , caspase-3 , caspase-9 , and cytochrome c , and decreased survivin ) and apoptotic index , ( 3 ) decreased inflammation ( decreased Cox-2 ) , and ( 4 ) decreased MAPK activation ( p-ERK and p-p38 ) .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling,tumor promoting inflammation
23394443_s6	These data indicate that tumor growth decreased due to the modulation of cellular pathways associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis .	
23405783_s0	OBJECTIVE To sort and identify side population ( SP ) cancer stem cells ( CSC ) in human prostate cancer ( PCa ) cell lines .	
23405783_s1	METHODS Stem-like cells were isolated from five PCa cell lines Du145 , IA8 , LNCaP , TSU-Pr and PC-3 using FACS based on CD133+ CD44+ immunophenotype and SP in Hoechst staining .	
23405783_s2	The in vitro growth pattern and tumorigenicity of SP stem cells were verified by soft agar colony-formation trial .	
23405783_s3	LNCaP/SP cells were selected for further identification of stem cell properties using immunostaining , proliferation and invasion assay .	
23405783_s4	Eventually , tumorigenicity and metastasis ability of LNCaP/SP were confirmed by xenograft experiments .	
23405783_s5	RESULTS The percentages of CSCs of the CD133 CD44 + immunophenotype were extremely low in the five PCa cell lines .	
23405783_s6	On the contrary , the percentages of the isolated SP cells were significantly higher in Du145 ( [ 0.15 +/- 0.02]% ) , IA8 ( [ 0.60 +/- 0.07 ]% ) , LNCaP ( [ 0.8 +/- 0.1]% ) and TSU-PrL ( [ 2.0 +/- 0.4]% ) , but none was detected in PC-3 .	
23405783_s7	Besides , IA8/SP , LNCaP/SP and TSU-PrL/SP cells showed a significantly greater colony-forming efficiency than non-side population ( NSP ) cells ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
23405783_s8	Compared with LNCaP/NSP cells , LNCaP/SP cells exhibited high expressions of integrin alpha2 , Nanog , CD44 , OCT4 and ABCG2 , remarkably enhanced invasive and proliferative potentials in vitro , and markedly increased tumorigenicity and metastasis ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23405783_s9	CONCLUSION SP sorting is more suitable than CD133+ CD44+ selection for enriching CSCs from PCa cell lines , and LNCaP/ SP represents a typical CSC population .	
23422737_s0	HM781-36B is an orally administered pan-human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) inhibitor .	
23422737_s1	To explore the role of pan-HER inhibitor in breast cancer , we investigated the antitumor effect and mechanisms of HM781-36B in breast cancer cell lines .	
23422737_s2	Six breast cancer cell lines ( BT474 , MDA-MB-453 , SK-BR-3 , T47D , MCF-7 , and MDA-MB-231 ) were tested .	
23422737_s3	The growth inhibitory effect was assessed using the tetrazolium bromide [ 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide ] assay .	
23422737_s4	The cell cycle at various concentrations of HM781-36B was analyzed by flow cytometry , and analysis of downstream molecules was performed by western blot analysis .	
23422737_s5	Interaction of HM781-36B with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents was analyzed by combination index using CalcuSyn .	
23422737_s6	The HER2-amplified cells ( SK-BR-3 , BT474 , and MDA-MB-453 ) were sensitive to HM781-36B ( IC50=0.001 Î¼mol/l , 0.0012 Î¼mol/l , and 0.0095 Î¼mol/l , respectively ) .	
23422737_s7	HM781-36B induced G1 arrest and resulted in apoptosis .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23422737_s8	It reduced the level of p-HER2 , p-AKT , p-ERK , and p-STAT3 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23422737_s9	HM781-36B combined with 5-fluorouracil , cisplatin , paclitaxel , or gemcitabine showed a synergistic inhibitory effect on the HER2-amplified and on some of the HER2-nonamplified breast cancer cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23422737_s10	HM781-36B could be a promising treatment for HER2-amplified breast cancer as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic agents and can be a candidate for treatment of HER2-nonamplified breast cancer in combination with cytotoxic agents .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23429262_s0	Disruption of contact inhibition and serum afflux that occur after a tissue injury activate cell cycle , which then stops when confluence is reached again .	
23429262_s1	Although the events involved in cell cycle entry have been widely documented , those managing cell cycle exit have remained so far ill defined .	
23429262_s2	We have identified that the final stage of wound closure is preceded in keratinocytes by a strong accumulation of miR-483-3p , which acts as a mandatory signal triggering cell cycle arrest when confluence is reached .	
23429262_s3	Blocking miR-483-3p accumulation strongly delays cell cycle exit , maintains cells into a proliferative state and retards their differentiation program .	
23429262_s4	Using two models of cell cycle synchronization ( i.e. mechanical injury and serum addition ) , we show that an ectopic upregulation of miR-483-3p blocks cell cycle progression in early G1 phase .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23429262_s5	This arrest results from a direct targeting of the CDC25A phosphatase by miR-483-3p , which can be impeded using an anti-miRNA against miR-483-3p or a protector that blocks the complex formation between miR-483-3p and the 3'-untranslated region ( UTR ) of CDC25A transcript .	
23429262_s6	We show that the miRNA-induced silencing of CDC25A increases the tyrosine phosphorylation status of CDK4/6 cyclin-dependent kinases which , in turn , abolishes CDK4/6 capacity to associate with D-type cyclins .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23429262_s7	This prevents CDK4/6 kinases ' activation , impairs downstream events such as cyclin E stimulation and sequesters cells in early G1 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23429262_s8	We propose this new regulatory process of cyclin-CDK association as a general mechanism coupling miRNA-mediated CDC25A invalidation to CDK post-transcriptional modifications and cell cycle control .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23430509_s0	A new cell line of human ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma ( CCC ) , TU-OC-1 , was established and characterized .	
23430509_s1	The cells showed a polygonal-shaped morphology and grew in monolayers without contact inhibition and were arranged like a jigsaw puzzle .	
23430509_s2	The chromosome numbers ranged from 64 to 90 .	
23430509_s3	A low rate of proliferation was observed , similar to other CCC cell lines tested ( OVTOKO , RMG-I , and OVAS ) , and the doubling time was 38.4h .	
23430509_s4	The respective IC50 values of cisplatin and paclitaxel were 12.2Î¼M and 58.3nM .	
23430509_s5	Mutational analysis revealed that TU-OC-1 cells harbored a PIK3CA mutation at codon 542 ( E542K ) in exon 9 , which is a mutation hot spot on this gene .	genomic instability and mutation
23430509_s6	We observed that phosphorylated Akt protein was overexpressed in TU-OC-1 cells by western blot analysis .	
23430509_s7	Heterotransplantation to nude mice produced tumors that reflected the original .	
23430509_s8	This cell line may be useful to study the chemoresistant mechanisms of CCC and contribute to novel treatment strategies .	
23458731_s0	We recently reported that chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) patients harbour high levels of STAT5 when they progress to advanced phases of disease .	
23458731_s1	Advanced disease is characterized by an increased incidence of BCR-ABL1 mutations .	
23458731_s2	We now describe a highly significant correlation between STAT5 expression and the incidence of BCR-ABL1 mutations in primary CML .	
23458731_s3	Forced expression of STAT5 in murine BCR-ABL1 transformed cells sufficed to enhance the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and to trigger DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
23458731_s4	STAT5-mediated ROS production is independent of JAK2 but requires concomitant BCR-ABL1 signalling as forced STAT5 expression in untransformed BCR-ABL1 negative cells has no impact on ROS levels .	tumor promoting inflammation
23458731_s5	Only within the context of a BCR-ABL1 positive cell does STAT5 transcriptionally regulate a target gene or set of genes that causes the enhanced ROS production .	tumor promoting inflammation
23458731_s6	Our study suggests the existence of a feed-forward loop accelerating disease progression , in which BCR-ABL1 enhances its own mutation rate in a STAT5-ROS dependent manner .	genomic instability and mutation
23458731_s7	This model explains the increased occurrence of inhibitor-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations in advanced disease stages driven and characterized by high STAT5 expression .	genomic instability and mutation
23482850_s0	Transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-Î² ) signaling has been implicated in driving tumor progression and metastasis by inducing stem cell-like features in some human cancer cell lines .	
23482850_s1	In this study , we have utilized a novel murine cell line NMuMG-ST , which acquired cancer stem cell ( CSC ) phenotypes during spontaneous transformation of the untransformed murine mammary cell line NMuMG , to investigate the role of autocrine TGF-Î² signaling in regulating their survival , metastatic ability , and the maintenance of cancer stem cell characteristics .	
23482850_s2	We have retrovirally transduced a dominant-negative TGF-Î² type II receptor ( DNRII ) into the NMuMG-ST cell to abrogate autocrine TGF-Î² signaling .	
23482850_s3	The expression of DNRII reduced TGF-Î² sensitivity of the NMuMG-ST cells in various cell-based assays .	
23482850_s4	The blockade of autocrine TGF-Î² signaling reduced the ability of the cell to grow anchorage-independently and to resist serum deprivation-induced apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23482850_s5	These phenotypes were associated with reduced levels of active and phosphorylated AKT and ERK , and Gli1 expression suggesting that these pathways contribute to the growth and survival of this model system .	
23482850_s6	More interestingly , the abrogation of autocrine TGF-Î² signaling also led to the attenuation of several features associated with mammary stem cells including epithelial-mesenchymal transition , mammosphere formation , and expression of stem cell markers .	
23482850_s7	When xenografted in athymic nude mice , the DNRII cells were also found to undergo apoptosis and induced significantly lower lung metastasis burden than the control cells even though they formed similar size of xenograft tumors .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
23482850_s8	Thus , our results indicate that autocrine TGF-Î² signaling is involved in the maintenance and survival of stem-like cell population resulting in the enhanced metastatic ability of the murine breast cancer cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23484085_s0	Systemic oxidative stress is associated with a wide range of pathological conditions .	
23484085_s1	Oxidative DNA damage is frequently measured in circulating lymphocytes .	
23484085_s2	Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) is known to be more sensitive to oxidative damage than nuclear DNA but is rarely used for direct measurement of DNA damage in clinical studies .	
23484085_s3	Based on the supercoiling-sensitive real-time PCR method , we propose a new approach for the noninvasive monitoring of systemic oxidative stress by quantifying the mtDNA structural damage and copy number change in isolated lymphocytes in a single test .	
23484085_s4	We show that lymphocytes have significantly less mtDNA content and relatively lower baseline levels of damage than cancer cell lines .	
23484085_s5	In an ex vivo challenge experiment , we demonstrate , for the first time , that exogenous H2O2 induces a significant increase in mtDNA damage in lymphocytes from healthy individuals , but no repair activity is observed after 1 h recovery .	genomic instability and mutation
23484085_s6	We further demonstrate that whole blood may serve as a convenient alternative to the isolated lymphocytes in mtDNA analysis .	
23484085_s7	Thus , the blood analysis with the multiple mtDNA end-points proposed in the current study may provide a simple and sensitive test to interrogate the nature and extent of systemic oxidative stress for a broad spectrum of clinical investigations .	tumor promoting inflammation
23513490_s0	Metastases in the sellar region are rare and are frequently found incidentally or in necropsies .	
23513490_s1	Only 7% are reported to be symptomatic .	
23513490_s2	Diabetes insipidus , anterior pituitary dysfunction , visual field defects , headache/pain and ophthalmoplegia are the most commonly reported symptoms .	
23513490_s3	We present the cases of two male patients with a small-cell lung carcinoma whose first clinical symptoms were due to pituitary metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
23513490_s4	One case presented with symptoms of cavernous sinus invasion and panhypopituitarism and the other case with diabetes insipidus .	
23513490_s5	Both patients had a rapid progression of their disease despite chemotherapy and died after a few months .	
23513490_s6	Pituitary metastases occur most commonly with breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men .	activating invasion and metastasis
23513490_s7	The presence of polyuria and polydipsia in an oncologic patient should alert the physician for diabetes insipidus and , if confirmed , an imaging procedure of the pituitary gland is mandatory .	
23513490_s8	Treatment for these tumors is often multimodal and includes surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormone replacement .	
23513490_s9	Although surgical series have not shown any significant survival benefits given by tumor resection , the patient's quality of life may be improved .	
23542175_s0	Within the family of protein kinase C ( PKC ) molecules , the novel isoform PRKCE ( PKCÉ ) acts as a bona fide oncogene in in vitro and in vivo models of tumorigenesis .	
23542175_s1	Previous studies have reported expression of PKCÉ in breast , prostate and lung tumors above that of normal adjacent tissue .	
23542175_s2	Data from the cancer genome atlas suggest increased copy number of PRKCE in triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) .	
23542175_s3	We find that overexpression of PKCÉ in a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line is sufficient to overcome contact inhibition and results in the formation of cellular foci .	evading growth suppressors
23542175_s4	Correspondingly , inhibition of PKCÉ in a TNBC cell model results in growth defects in two-dimensional ( 2D ) and three-dimensional ( 3D ) culture conditions and orthotopic xenografts .	
23542175_s5	Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in a cell culture phosphoproteomic approach , we find that CTNND1/p120ctn phosphorylation at serine 268 ( P-S268 ) occurs in a strictly PKCÉ-dependent manner , and that loss of PKCÉ signaling in TNBC cells leads to reversal of mesenchymal morphology and signaling .	
23542175_s6	In a model of Ras activation , inhibition of PKCÉ is sufficient to block mesenchymal cell morphology .	
23542175_s7	Finally , treatment with a PKCÉ ATP mimetic inhibitor , PF-5263555 , recapitulates genetic loss of function experiments impairing p120ctn phosphorylation as well as compromising TNBC cell growth in vitro and in vivo .	
23542175_s8	We demonstrate PKCÉ as a tractable therapeutic target for TNBC , where p120ctn phosphorylation may serve as a readout for monitoring patient response.Oncogene advance online publication , 1 April 2013 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.91 .	
23565596_s0	Cell migration plays important roles in natural processes involving embryonic development , inflammation , wound healing , cancer metastasis and angiogenesis .	
23565596_s1	Cell migration on various biomaterials is also believed to improve the rate of wound healing and implant therapies in the tissue-engineering field .	
23565596_s2	This study measured the distance traversed , or mileage , of mouse fibroblasts on a silk fibroin surface .	
23565596_s3	Fibroblasts on the fibroin surface moved with better progress during 24 h than cells on collagen or fibronectin surfaces .	
23565596_s4	Results obtained by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) revealed that fibroblasts on the fibroin surface expressed transforming growth factor β-induced protein ( TGFBI ) , which is an extracellular matrix ( ECM ) protein , stronger than on other surfaces in the early cell-culture stages .	activating invasion and metastasis
23565596_s5	These results demonstrate that the fibroin surface shows higher potential to enhance cell migration and the production of ECM than a collagen or fibronectin surface .	activating invasion and metastasis
23587231_s0	BACKGROUND Angiogenesis is an essential process in cancer growth maintenance , and metastasis .	
23587231_s1	Angiopoietin-2 promotes tumor angiogenesis by priming the vasculature and potentiating the effects of cytokines at the front of active neovascularization .	
23587231_s2	Enhanced expression of angiopoietin-2 has been reported in lung cancer tissue .	
23587231_s3	Survivin is one of the inhibitors of apoptosis protein that has been shown to play a key role in cancer progression , and in tumor angiogenesis .	
23587231_s4	Also plays a key role in tumor cell resistance to anticancer agents and ionizing radiation .	
23587231_s5	AIM To measure the serum levels of angiopoietin-2 and survivin as possible angiogenic factors in lung cancer patients with the assessment of their interrelationships and clinical significance .	
23587231_s6	PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with lung cancer as NSCLC ( n=70 ) and healthy volunteers ( n=10 ) were enrolled .	
23587231_s7	Serum angiopoietin-2 and survivin concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELIZA ) .	
23587231_s8	RESULTS Median serum angiopoietin-2 levels with lung cancer ( 2730pg/mL ) ranged from 1171 to 6541pg/mL was higher than the median of the control group ( 1795pg/mL ) ranged from 1076 to 2730/mL , p&lt;0.001 .	inducing angiogenesis
23587231_s9	Median serum survivin levels were also higher in patients with lung cancer ( 53.0pg/mL ) ranged from 39.3 to 96.3pg/mL than the median of the control group ( 48.8pg/mL ) ranged from 38.0 to 74.6pg/mL , but did not reach statistical significance p=0.206 .	
23587231_s10	In all patients with lung cancer , serum angiopoietin-2 was not significantly correlated with survivin ( r=0.073 , p=0.657 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
23587231_s11	Neither serum angiopoietin-2 nor survivin showed significant relation with the serum angiopoietin-2 or survivin levels depending on the cell types , stage progression , and metastasis among the patients with NSCLC .	inducing angiogenesis
23587231_s12	CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that serum angiopoietin-2 is a useful marker for the diagnosis of NSCLC by ELIZA technique .	inducing angiogenesis
23648393_s0	Understanding how arsenic exacts its diverse , global disease burden is hampered by a limited understanding of the particular biological pathways that are disrupted by arsenic and underlie pathogenesis .	
23648393_s1	A reductionist view would predict that a small number of basic pathways are generally perturbed by arsenic , and manifest as diverse diseases .	
23648393_s2	Following an initial observation that arsenite-exposed cells in culture acidify their media more rapidly than control cells , the report here shows that low level exposure to arsenite ( 75ppb ) is sufficient to induce aerobic glycolysis ( the Warburg effect ) as a generalized phenomenon in cultured human primary cells and cell lines .	cellular energetics
23648393_s3	Expanded studies in one such cell line , the non-malignant pulmonary epithelial line , BEAS-2B , established that the arsenite-induced Warburg effect was associated with increased accumulation of intracellular and extracellular lactate , an increased rate of extracellular acidification , and inhibition by the non-metabolized glucose analog , 2-deoxy-D-glucose .	cellular energetics
23648393_s4	Associated with the induction of aerobic glycolysis was a pathway-wide induction of glycolysis gene expression , as well as protein accumulation of an established glycolysis master-regulator , hypoxia-inducible factor 1A .	cellular energetics
23648393_s5	Arsenite-induced alteration of energy production in human cells represents the type of fundamental perturbation that could extend to many tissue targets and diseases .	
23667739_s0	The DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) pathway corrects specific types of DNA replication errors that affect microsatellites and thus is critical for maintaining genomic integrity .	
23667739_s1	The genes of the MMR pathway are highly conserved across different organisms .	
23667739_s2	Likewise , defective MMR function universally results in microsatellite instability ( MSI ) which is a hallmark of certain types of cancer associated with the Mendelian disorder hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer .	
23667739_s3	( Lynch syndrome ) .	
23667739_s4	To identify previously unrecognized deleted genes or loci that can lead to MSI , we developed a functional genomics screen utilizing a plasmid containing a microsatellite sequence that is a host spot for MSI mutations and the comprehensive homozygous diploid deletion mutant resource for Saccharomyces cerevisiae .	
23667739_s5	This pool represents a collection of non-essential homozygous yeast diploid ( 2N ) mutants in which there are deletions for over four thousand yeast open reading frames ( ORFs ) .	
23667739_s6	From our screen , we identified a deletion mutant strain of the PAU24 gene that leads to MSI .	genomic instability and mutation
23667739_s7	In a series of validation experiments , we determined that this PAU24 mutant strain had an increased MSI-specific mutation rate in comparison to the original background wildtype strain , other deletion mutants and comparable to a MMR mutant involving the MLH1 gene .	genomic instability and mutation
23667739_s8	Likewise , in yeast strains with a deletion of PAU24 , we identified specific de novo indel mutations that occurred within the targeted microsatellite used for this screen .	genomic instability and mutation
23716868_s0	The current study was undertaken to study the effect of a macerated extract of Nigella sativa seeds in normal as well as in tumour bearing mice against gamma radiation-induced cellular damage to normal tissues .	
23716868_s1	This was done to mimic the clinical setting where in , normal tissues of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy are exposed to the deleterious effects of radiation .	
23716868_s2	The protection of cellular DNA was analysed in peripheral blood leucocytes of whole body irradiated mice following pretreatment with macerated extract of Nigella sativa seeds ( 100 mg/kg ) , using alkaline comet assay , and also estimating biochemical and blood parameters such as levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase , thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and protein oxidation in organs such as spleen , liver , brain and intestine haemoglobin and total leucocyte count , respectively .	
23716868_s3	The results showed that the macerated extract of Nigella sativa seeds protected the liver , spleen , brain and intestines both in normal as well as tumour bearing mice .	
23716868_s4	This study concludes that macerated extract of Nigella sativa seeds has protective effects against radiation-induced damage and biochemical alterations which could be attributed to the ability to scavenge free radicals and its antioxidant properties .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
23716868_s5	Hence macerated extract of Nigella sativa seeds , could be used in combination with radiation to protect against oxidative stress in normal tissues and improving the quality of life of cancer patients by mitigating unwanted side effects of radiation in normal tissues .	tumor promoting inflammation
23758735_s0	BACKGROUND In this paper we propose a chemical physics mechanism for the initiation of the glycolytic switch commonly known as the Warburg hypothesis , whereby glycolytic activity terminating in lactate continues even in well-oxygenated cells .	
23758735_s1	We show that this may result in cancer via mitotic failure , recasting the current conception of the Warburg effect as a metabolic dysregulation consequent to cancer , to a biophysical defect that may contribute to cancer initiation .	
23758735_s2	MODEL Our model is based on analogs of thermodynamic concepts that tie non-equilibrium fluid dynamics ultimately to metabolic imbalance , disrupted microtubule dynamics , and finally , genomic instability , from which cancers can arise .	
23758735_s3	Specifically , we discuss how an analog of non-equilibrium Rayleigh-Benard convection can result in glycolytic oscillations and cause a cell to become locked into a higher-entropy state characteristic of cancer .	
23758735_s4	CONCLUSIONS A quantitative model is presented that attributes the well-known Warburg effect to a biophysical mechanism driven by a convective disturbance in the cell .	cellular energetics
23758735_s5	Contrary to current understanding , this effect may precipitate cancer development , rather than follow from it , providing new insights into carcinogenesis , cancer treatment , and prevention .	
23772373_s0	The green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) is the most commonly used reporter protein for monitoring gene expression and protein localization in a variety of living and fixed cells , including not only prokaryotes , but also eukaryotes , e.g. , yeasts , mammals , plants and fish .	
23772373_s1	In general , it is thought that GFP is nontoxic to cells , although there are some reports on the side effect of GFP .	
23772373_s2	Further , details of the molecular mechanism concerning the side effect of GFP remain unclear .	
23772373_s3	Here we show that Ku80 , but not XRCC4 , plays an important role in the mechanism of the resistance to cytotoxicity induced by enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23772373_s4	EGFP inhibited both cell proliferation and colony formation , and induced cell death in Ku80-deficient hamster cells , i.e. , xrs-6 cells .	
23772373_s5	In addition , Ku80 attenuated EGFP-induced cytotoxicity in the xrs-6 cells .	
23772373_s6	No EGFP-induced cytotoxicity was observed in the NHEJ core protein XRCC4-deficient hamster cells , i.e. , XR-1 cells .	genomic instability and mutation
23772373_s7	Furthermore , EGFP markedly enhanced X-ray-induced cytotoxicity in the xrs-6 cells .	
23772373_s8	These results suggest that Ku80 plays a key role in the novel NHEJ-independent defense mechanism against EGFP-induced cytotoxicity .	genomic instability and mutation
23772373_s9	Caution should be taken in considering of the potential influence by the stress response mechanism , namely , the Ku80-dependent elimination mechanism of EGFP-induced cytotoxicity , being activated , even when using EGFP-expressing cells in which Ku80 functions normally .	
23772374_s0	As a member of peroxiredoxin ( Prx ) family , PrxIII is predominantly located in mitochondria and plays an important role as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .	
23772374_s1	Since previous reports demonstrated over-expression of PrxIII in cervical cancer , we conducted the present study to investigate the significance of PrxIII in cervical cancer development and/or progression .	
23772374_s2	Cervical cancer cells were cultured from tissues derived from cervical cancer patients .	
23772374_s3	After successful knockdown of PrxIII expression by small interfering RNA , we evaluated ROS level , viable cell number , and apoptosis of cervical cancer cells along with the culture time .	
23772374_s4	The production of ROS was increased in cervical cancer cells as compared with normal cervical epithelia .	tumor promoting inflammation
23772374_s5	Knockdown of PrxIII expression induced up-regulation of other Prx members including PrxI , PrxII , and PrxV .	
23772374_s6	ROS level was higher in down-regulated cervical cancer cells than in controls and the difference was increasing with culture time .	tumor promoting inflammation
23772374_s7	We also observed increased apoptosis and decreased viable cell number in down-regulated cervical cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23772374_s8	Our results suggest that PrxIII is an indispensable ROS scavenger , which protects tumor cells against oxidative damage and subsequent apoptosis .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23798001_s0	Cellular senescence , an irreversible cell cycle arrest induced by a diversity of stimuli , has been considered as an innate tumor suppressing mechanism with implications and applications in cancer therapy .	
23798001_s1	Using a targeted proteomics approach , we show that fibroblasts induced into senescence by expression of oncogenic Ras exhibit a decrease of global acetylation on all core histones , consistent with formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci .	enabling replicative immortality
23798001_s2	We also detected clear increases in repressive markers ( e.g. &gt;50% elevation of H3K27me2/3 ) along with decreases in histone marks associated with increased transcriptional expression/elongation ( e.g .	
23798001_s3	H3K36me2/3 ) .	
23798001_s4	Despite the increases in repressive marks of chromatin , 179 loci ( of 2206 total ) were found to be upregulated by global quantitative proteomics .	
23798001_s5	The changes in the cytosolic proteome indicated an upregulation of mitochondrial proteins and downregulation of proteins involved in glycolysis .	cellular energetics
23798001_s6	These alterations in primary metabolism are opposite to the well-known Warburg effect observed in cancer cells .	cellular energetics
23798001_s7	This study significantly improves our understanding of stress-induced senescence and provides a potential application for triggering it in antiproliferative strategies that target the primary metabolism in cancer cells .	enabling replicative immortality
23920275_s0	Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) plays a critical role in reprogramming cancer metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis ( i.e. , the Warburg effect ) , which is critical to supplying cancer cells with the biomass needed for proliferation .	
23920275_s1	Previous studies have shown that cetuximab , an EGF receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody , downregulates the alpha subunit of HIF-1 ( HIF-1α ) through the inhibition of EGF receptor downstream cell signaling and that downregulation of HIF-1α is required for cetuximab-induced antiproliferative effects .	
23920275_s2	However , the mechanism underlying these actions has yet to be identified .	
23920275_s3	In this study , we used the Seahorse XF96 extracellular flux analyzer to assess the effect of cetuximab treatment on changes in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration , the two major energy-producing pathways , in live cells .	
23920275_s4	We found that cetuximab downregulated lactate dehydrogenase A ( LDH-A ) and inhibited glycolysis in cetuximab-sensitive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) cells in an HIF-1α downregulation-dependent manner .	cellular energetics
23920275_s5	HNSCC cells with acquired cetuximab resistance expressed a high level of HIF-1α and were highly glycolytic .	cellular energetics
23920275_s6	Overexpression of a HIF-1α mutant ( HIF-1α/ΔODD ) conferred resistance to cetuximab-induced G1 phase cell-cycle arrest , which could be overcome by knockdown of LDH-A expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23920275_s7	Inhibition of LDH-A activity with oxamate enhanced the response of cetuximab-resistant cells to cetuximab .	
23920275_s8	Cetuximab had no noticeable inhibitory effect on glycolysis in nontransformed cells .	cellular energetics
23920275_s9	These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into cetuximab-induced cell-cycle arrest from the perspective of cancer metabolism and suggest novel strategies for enhancing cetuximab response .	
23922328_s0	Oncogene-induced senescence is now recognized as being an important mechanism in protecting against cancer .	
23922328_s1	The phenotypic consequences , i.e. , the inhibition of cell proliferation , are well described in model systems and specific events/key players defined .	
23922328_s2	However , there is still the need to understand , at a more global level , the network of events involved both in terms of cause and consequence .	
23922328_s3	This paper shows the power of systematic proteomic analyses , both targeted and global , in addressing such biological questions , highlighting the widespread nature of histone acetylation changes , and the opposite metabolic changes to those seen in the Warburg effect .	cellular energetics
23928665_s0	CONTEXT Papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) is the most frequent thyroid tumor and is responsible for the overall increase in thyroid cancer incidence .	
23928665_s1	S100A11 ( calgizzarin ) , a member of the S100 Ca(2+)-binding protein family , is involved in several different biological processes .	
23928665_s2	S100A11 has been found up-regulated in PTC , both at the mRNA and protein levels .	
23928665_s3	OBJECTIVE Through a combination of expression analysis and functional in vitro and in vivo studies , we have attempted to gain insight into the relevance of S100A11 overexpression in PTC biology .	
23928665_s4	DESIGN The expression of the S100A11 gene in PTC was investigated in several gene expression data sets .	
23928665_s5	The effect of S100A11 silencing on the hallmarks of the malignant phenotype of several PTC-derived cell lines was investigated .	
23928665_s6	In NIH3T3 cells , the cooperation of S100A11 with the different PTC-specific oncogenes was assessed .	
23928665_s7	RESULTS We found that the S100A11 gene expression is frequently up-regulated in PTC , anaplastic thyroid carcinoma , but not in follicular thyroid carcinoma .	
23928665_s8	S100A11 overexpression was also detected in PTC-derived cell lines , which were then used for functional studies .	
23928665_s9	S100A11 silencing in PTC-derived cell lines did not affect cell proliferation , whereas it reduced the loss of contact inhibition , anchorage-independent growth , and resistance to anoikis .	evading growth suppressors
23928665_s10	Cotransfection experiments in NIH3T3 cells showed that overexpression of the S100A11 gene was able to enhance the transforming capabilities of the different PTC-associated oncogenes by affecting the loss of contact inhibition , anchorage-independent growth , and in vivo tumor formation .	evading growth suppressors
23928665_s11	CONCLUSION Our data indicate that S100A11 overexpression exerts a protumoral functional role in PTC pathogenesis .	
23949920_s0	BACKGROUND Yes Associated Protein ( YAP ) has been implicated in the control of organ size by regulating cell proliferation and survival .	
23949920_s1	YAP is a transcriptional coactivator that controls cellular responses through interaction with TEAD transcription factors in the nucleus , while its transcriptional functions are inhibited by phosphorylation-dependent translocation to the cytosol .	
23949920_s2	YAP overexpression has been associated with different types of cancer , such as lung , skin , prostate , ovary and liver cancer .	
23949920_s3	Recently , YAP was linked to E-cadherin-dependent regulation of contact inhibition in breast cancer cells .	
23949920_s4	RESULTS In this study we examined YAP protein expression and cellular localization in 237 cases of human invasive breast cancer by immunohistochemistry and related its expression to clinicopathological features and E-cadherin expression .	
23949920_s5	We observed that invasive lobular carcinoma is characterized by higher expression levels of both nuclear and cytosolic YAP ( pâ&lt;â0.001 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
23949920_s6	Nuclear YAP expression did not associate with other variables such as lymph node involvement , tumor grade , tumor size , mitotic activity or the molecular sub-types of invasive breast cancer .	
23949920_s7	We observed that high nuclear and cytosolic YAP expression are associated with the E-cadherin deficient breast cancer subtype ILC ( pâ&lt;â0.001 ) and cell lines derived from human breast cancers and conditional mouse models of human lobular breast cancer .	
23949920_s8	CONCLUSIONS Since our data indicate that nuclear YAP localization is more common in breast cancers lacking functional adherens junctions , it suggests that YAP-mediated transcription may be involved in the development and progression of invasive lobular breast cancer .	
24009839_s0	The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of rutaecarpine on DNA strand breaks and apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) in murine Hepa-1c1c7 cells .	
24009839_s1	Oxidative DNA damage was estimated by nuclear condensation assessment , fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis , and Comet assay .	
24009839_s2	Rutaecarpine inhibited cell death induced by 500 μM H2O2 , as assessed by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI ) staining .	resisting cell death
24009839_s3	Treatment with rutaecarpine reduced the number of DNA strand breaks induced by H2O2 , as assessed by DAPI staining and Comet assay , and increased quinone reductase , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , and pAkt protein levels , as assessed by western blotting .	genomic instability and mutation
24009843_s0	Although the immense efforts have been made for cancer prevention , early diagnosis , and treatment , cancer morbidity and mortality has not been decreased during last forty years .	
24009843_s1	Especially , lung cancer is top-ranked in cancer-associated human death .	
24009843_s2	Therefore , effective strategy is strongly required for the management of lung cancer .	
24009843_s3	In the present study , we found that novel daphnane diterpenoids , yuanhualine ( YL ) , yuanhuahine ( YH ) and yuanhuagine ( YG ) isolated from the flower of Daphne genkwa ( Thymelaeaceae ) , exhibited potent anti-proliferative activities against human lung A549 cells with the IC50 values of 7.0 , 15.2 and 24.7 nM , respectively .	
24009843_s4	Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the daphnane diterpenoids induced cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 as well as G2/M phase in A549 cells .	
24009843_s5	The cell-cycle arrests were well correlated with the expression of checkpoint proteins including the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and p53 and down-regulation of cyclin A , cyclin B1 , cyclin E , cyclin dependent kinase 4 , cdc2 , phosphorylation of Rb and cMyc expression .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
24009843_s6	In the analysis of signal transduction molecules , the daphnane diterpenoids suppressed the activation of Akt , STAT3 and Src in human lung cancer cells .	
24009843_s7	The daphnane diterpenoids also exerted the potent anti-proliferative activity against anticancer-drug resistant cancer cells including gemcitabine-resistant A549 , gefitinib- , erlotinib-resistant H292 cells .	
24009843_s8	Synergistic effects in the growth inhibition were also observed when yuanhualine was combined with gemcitabine , gefitinib or erlotinib in A549 cells .	
24009843_s9	Taken together , these findings suggest that the novel daphnane diterpenoids might provide lead candidates for the development of therapeutic agents for human lung cancers .	
24022637_s0	Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene amplification and overexpression are commonly present in glioblastoma , and confer advantages of growth , invasiveness and radio/chemotherapy-resistance for tumour cells .	
24022637_s1	Here , we assessed the role of EGFR activation for downstream mitogenic signalling in the commonly used glioblastoma cell line U251 .	
24022637_s2	Despite the high expression level , activation of EGFR under standard culture conditions was low .	
24022637_s3	Intact EGFR function was verified by the rapid phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream mitogen-activated protein(MAP) kinase ERK1/2 upon addition of exogenous EGF to serum-starved cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
24022637_s4	By contrast , addition of fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) activated downstream ERK1/2 via the MAP kinase kinase without phosphorylating EGFR .	sustaining proliferative signaling
24022637_s5	A phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase array showed FBS-induced activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R),and the IGF-1R inhibitor AG1024 inhibited FBS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , implying IGF-1R as the major driver of FBS-associated mitogenic signalling in the absence of exogenous EGF .	sustaining proliferative signaling
24022637_s6	These findings have important implications for in vitro drug testing in glioblastoma .	
24022637_s7	Moreover , activation of ERK1/2 was also strongly influenced by growth state and cell density of U251 cultures .	
24022637_s8	Re-seeding exponentially growing cultures at high cell density induced p27/CDKN1B expression and suppressed P-ERK1/2 indicating a certain regulation of proliferation by contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
24022637_s9	Strikingly , highly activated ERK1/2 signalling and cell cycle progression occurred when cells were released from plateau phase regardless of high seeding density .	
24022637_s10	This phenomenon might implicate a proliferation response in the early recurrence observed after clinical therapy in glioblastoma patients .	
24022637_s11	However , whether it will recapitulate in vivo remains to be demonstrated .	
24068038_s0	Accumulating data suggest arsenic may be an endocrine disruptor and tentatively linked to breast cancer by some studies .	
24068038_s1	Therefore , we tested the effects of chronic inorganic arsenic exposure on the normal estrogen receptor ( ER)-negative breast epithelial cell line , MCF-10A .	
24068038_s2	Cells were chronically exposed to a low-level arsenite ( 500nM ) for up to 24weeks .	
24068038_s3	Markers of cancer cell phenotype and the expression of critical genes relevant to breast cancer or stem cells ( SCs ) were examined .	
24068038_s4	After 24weeks , chronic arsenic-exposed breast epithelial ( CABE ) cells showed increases in secreted MMP activity , colony formation , invasion , and proliferation rate , indicating an acquired cancer cell phenotype .	activating invasion and metastasis
24068038_s5	These CABE cells presented with basal-like breast cancer characteristics , including ER-Î± , HER-2 , and progesterone receptor negativity , and overexpression of K5 and p63 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
24068038_s6	Putative CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) breast SCs were increased to 80% over control in CABE cells .	
24068038_s7	CABE cells also formed multilayer cell mounds , indicative of loss of contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
24068038_s8	These mounds showed high levels of K5 and p63 , indicating the potential presence of cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) .	
24068038_s9	Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition occurred during arsenic exposure .	activating invasion and metastasis
24068038_s10	Overexpression of aromatase , a key rate-limiting enzyme in estrogen synthesis , occurred with arsenic starting early on in exposure .	
24068038_s11	Levels of 17Î²-estradiol increased in CABE cells and their conditioned medium .	
24068038_s12	The aromatase inhibitor letrozole abolished arsenic-induced increases in 17Î²-estradiol production and reversed cancer cell phenotype .	
24068038_s13	Thus , chronic arsenic exposure drives human breast epithelia into a cancer cell phenotype with an apparent overabundance of putative CSCs .	
24068038_s14	Arsenic appears to transform breast epithelia through overexpression of aromatase , thereby activating oncogenic processes independent of ER .	
24100035_s0	Metabolic reprogramming in cancer is manifested by persistent aerobic glycolysis and suppression of mitochondrial function and is known as the Warburg effect .	
24100035_s1	The Warburg effect contributes to cancer progression and is considered to be a promising therapeutic target .	
24100035_s2	Understanding the mechanisms used by cancer cells to suppress their mitochondria may lead to development of new approaches to reverse metabolic reprogramming .	
24100035_s3	We have evaluated mitochondrial function and morphology in poorly respiring LM7 and 143B osteosarcoma ( OS ) cell lines showing the Warburg effect in comparison with actively respiring Saos2 and HOS OS cells and noncancerous osteoblastic hFOB cells .	
24100035_s4	In LM7 and 143B cells , we detected markers of the mitochondrial permeability transition ( MPT ) , such as mitochondrial swelling , depolarization , and membrane permeabilization .	
24100035_s5	In addition , we detected mitochondrial swelling in human OS xenografts in mice and archival human OS specimens using electron microscopy .	
24100035_s6	The MPT inhibitor sanglifehrin A reversed MPT markers and increased respiration in LM7 and 143B cells .	
24100035_s7	Our data suggest that the MPT may play a role in suppression of mitochondrial function , contributing to the Warburg effect in cancer .	cellular energetics
24112101_s0	Cancer cells require glucose to support their rapid growth through a process known as aerobic glycolysis , or the Warburg effect .	
24112101_s1	As in ovarian cancer cells , increased metabolic activity and glucose concentration has been linked to aggressiveness of cancer .	
24112101_s2	However , it is unclear as to whether targeting the glycolytic pathway may kill the malignant cells and likely have broad therapeutic implications against ovarian cancer metastasis .	
24112101_s3	In the present research , we found that EF24 , a HIF-1α inhibitor , could significantly block glucose uptake , the rate of glycolysis , and lactate production compared with vehicle treatment in SKOV-3 , A2780 and OVCAR-3 cells .	cellular energetics
24112101_s4	These results might possibly contribute to the further observation that EF24 could inhibit ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion from wound healing and Transwell assays .	activating invasion and metastasis
24112101_s5	Furthermore , as an important mediator of glucose metabolism , glucose transporter 1 ( Glut1 ) was found to contribute to the function of EF24 in both energy metabolism and metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis,cellular energetics
24112101_s6	To examine the effect of EF24 and the mediated role of Glut1 in vivo in a xenograph subcutaneous tumor model , intraperitoneal metastasis and lung metastasis model were introduced .	activating invasion and metastasis
24112101_s7	Our results indicated that EF24 treatment could inhibit tumor growth , intraperitoneal metastasis and lung metastasis of SKOV-3 cells , and Glut1 is a possible mediator for the role of EF24 .	activating invasion and metastasis
24112101_s8	In conclusion , our results highlight that an anti-cancer reagent with an inhibiting effect on energy metabolism could inhibit metastasis , and EF24 is a possible candidate for anti-metastasis therapeutic applications for ovarian cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis,cellular energetics
24121491_s0	One classical feature of cancer cells is their metabolic acquisition of a highly glycolytic phenotype .	
24121491_s1	Carbon monoxide ( CO ) , one of the products of the cytoprotective molecule heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 ) in cancer cells , has been implicated in carcinogenesis and therapeutic resistance .	
24121491_s2	However , the functional contributions of CO and HO-1 to these processes are poorly defined .	
24121491_s3	In human prostate cancers , we found that HO-1 was nuclear localized in malignant cells , with low enzymatic activity in moderately differentiated tumors correlating with relatively worse clinical outcomes .	
24121491_s4	Exposure to CO sensitized prostate cancer cells but not normal cells to chemotherapy , with growth arrest and apoptosis induced in vivo in part through mitotic catastrophe .	resisting cell death
24121491_s5	CO targeted mitochondria activity in cancer cells as evidenced by higher oxygen consumption , free radical generation , and mitochondrial collapse .	
24121491_s6	Collectively , our findings indicated that CO transiently induces an anti-Warburg effect by rapidly fueling cancer cell bioenergetics , ultimately resulting in metabolic exhaustion .	cellular energetics
24139416_s0	Metastasis is the most lethal attribute of human malignancy .	
24139416_s1	High-level expression of survivin is involved in both carcinogenesis and angiogenesis in cancer .	
24139416_s2	Previous studies indicate that a mutation of the threonine residue at position 34 ( Thr34Ala ) of survivin generates a dominant-negative mutant that induces apoptosis , inhibits angiogenesis , and suppresses highly metastatic breast carcinoma in mouse models .	
24139416_s3	We investigated the efficacy of gene therapy with a survivin dominant-negative mutant and possible factors related to lymph node metastasis .	
24139416_s4	The metastasis rate was compared between each group in order to find a survivin-targeted therapy against lymphangiogenesis in its earliest stages .	
24139416_s5	We established lymph node metastasis models and treated animals with H22 tumors with Lip-mSurvivinT34A ( Lip-mS ) , Lip-plasmid ( Lip-P ) , or normal saline ( NS ) .	
24139416_s6	Eight days after the last dose , five randomly chosen mice from each group were sacrificed .	
24139416_s7	We detected the apoptotic index , microvessel density ( MVD ) , lymphatic microvessel density ( LMVD ) , and the expression of VEGF-D with immunohistochemistry .	
24139416_s8	After the remaining animals were sacrificed , we compared the tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes in each group .	
24139416_s9	Administration of mSurvivinT34A plasmid complexed with cationic liposome ( DOTAP/chol ) resulted in the efficacious inhibition of tumor growth and lymph node metastasis within the mouse H22 tumor model .	activating invasion and metastasis
24139416_s10	These responses were associated with tumor cell apoptosis , and angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis inhibition .	inducing angiogenesis,resisting cell death
24139416_s11	Our results suggested that Lip-mSurvivinT34A induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis , thus suppressing tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis,resisting cell death
24139416_s12	The mSurvivinT34A survivin mutant is a promising strategy of gene therapy to inhibit lymphatic metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
24142698_s0	Pyruvate kinase M2 ( PKM2 ) is a key player in the Warburg effect of cancer cells .	
24142698_s1	However , the mechanisms of regulating PKM2 are not fully elucidated .	
24142698_s2	Here , we identified the protein-serine/threonine kinase PIM2 , a known oncogene , as a novel binding partner of PKM2 .	
24142698_s3	The interaction between PIM2 and PKM2 was confirmed by multiple biochemical approaches in vitro and in cultured cells .	
24142698_s4	Importantly , we found that PIM2 could directly phosphorylate PKM2 on the Thr-454 residue , resulting in an increase of PKM2 protein levels .	
24142698_s5	Compared with wild type , PKM2 with the phosphorylation-defective mutation displayed a reduced effect on glycolysis , co-activating HIF-1α and β-catenin , and cell proliferation , while enhancing mitochondrial respiration of cancer cells .	cellular energetics,genomic instability and mutation
24142698_s6	These findings demonstrate that PIM2-dependent phosphorylation of PKM2 is critical for regulating the Warburg effect in cancer , highlighting PIM2 as a potential therapeutic target .	cellular energetics
24148623_s0	Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults .	
24148623_s1	Overexpression of the EGF receptor ( EGFR ) is recognized as a widespread oncogenic signature in glioblastoma multiforme , but the complexity of its contributions is not fully understood , nor the most effective ways to leverage anti-EGFR therapy in this setting .	
24148623_s2	Hypoxia is known to drive the aggressive character of glioblastoma multiforme by promoting aerobic glycolysis rather than pyruvate oxidation carried out in mitochondria ( OXPHOS ) , a phenomenon termed the Warburg effect , which is a general feature of oncogenesis .	
24148623_s3	In this study , we report that hypoxia drives expression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase ( PDK1 ) and EGFR along with the hypoxia-inducing factor ( HIF)-1α in human glioblastoma multiforme cells .	
24148623_s4	PDK1 is a HIF-1-regulated gene and our findings indicated that hypoxia-induced PDK1 expression may promote EGFR activation , initiating a feed-forward loop that can sustain malignant progression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
24148623_s5	RNAi-mediated attenuation of PDK1 and EGFR lowered PDK1-EGFR activation and decreased HIF-1α expression , shifting the Warburg phenotype to OXPHOS and inhibiting glioblastoma multiforme growth and proliferation .	cellular energetics
24148623_s6	In clinical specimens of glioblastoma multiforme , we found that immunohistochemical expression of PDK1 , EGFR , and HIF-1α were elevated in glioblastoma multiforme specimens when compared with normal brain tissues .	
24148623_s7	Collectively , our studies establish PDK1 as a key driver and candidate therapeutic target in glioblastoma multiforme .	
24158109_s0	BACKGROUND Anti-angiogenic treatment of glioblastoma characteristically results in therapy resistance and tumor progression via diffuse infiltration .	
24158109_s1	Monitoring tumor progression in these patients is thwarted because therapy results in tumor invisibility in contrast-enhanced ( CE ) MRI .	
24158109_s2	To address this problem , we examined whether tumor progression could be monitored by metabolic mapping using ( 1)H MR spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) .	
24158109_s3	METHODS We treated groups of BALB/c nu/nu mice carrying different orthotopic diffuse-infiltrative glioblastoma xenografts with bevacizumab ( anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] antibody , n = 13 ) , cabozantinib ( combined VEGF receptor 2/c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor , n = 11 ) , or placebo ( n = 15 ) and compared CE-MRI with MRS-derived metabolic maps before , during , and after treatment .	
24158109_s4	Metabolic maps and CE-MRIs were subsequently correlated to histology and immunohistochemistry .	
24158109_s5	RESULTS In vivo imaging of choline/n-acetyl aspartate ratios via multivoxel MRS is better able to evaluate response to therapy than CE-MRI .	
24158109_s6	Lactate imaging revealed that diffuse infiltrative areas in glioblastoma xenografts did not present with excessive glycolysis .	cellular energetics
24158109_s7	In contrast , glycolysis was observed in hypoxic areas in angiogenesis-dependent compact regions of glioma only , especially after anti-angiogenic treatment .	cellular energetics,inducing angiogenesis
24158109_s8	CONCLUSION Our data present MRSI as a powerful and feasible approach that is superior to CE-MRI and may provide handles for optimizing treatment of glioma .	
24158109_s9	Furthermore , we show that glycolysis is more prominent in hypoxic areas than in areas of diffuse infiltrative growth .	cellular energetics
24158109_s10	The Warburg hypothesis of persisting glycolysis in tumors under normoxic conditions may thus not be valid for diffuse glioma .	cellular energetics
24186204_s0	Metastatic breast tumors undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which renders them resistant to therapies targeted to the primary cancers .	
24186204_s1	The mechanistic link between mtDNA ( mitochondrial DNA ) reduction , often seen in breast cancer patients , and EMT is unknown .	
24186204_s2	We demonstrate that reducing mtDNA content in human mammary epithelial cells ( hMECs ) activates Calcineurin ( Cn)-dependent mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway , which induces EMT-like reprogramming to fibroblastic morphology , loss of cell polarity , contact inhibition and acquired migratory and invasive phenotype .	activating invasion and metastasis,evading growth suppressors
24186204_s3	Notably , mtDNA reduction generates breast cancer stem cells .	
24186204_s4	In addition to retrograde signaling markers , there is an induction of mesenchymal genes but loss of epithelial markers in these cells .	
24186204_s5	The changes are reversed by either restoring the mtDNA content or knockdown of CnAÎ± mRNA , indicating the causal role of retrograde signaling in EMT .	activating invasion and metastasis
24186204_s6	Our results point to a new therapeutic strategy for metastatic breast cancers targeted to the mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway for abrogating EMT and attenuating cancer stem cells , which evade conventional therapies .	activating invasion and metastasis
24186204_s7	We report a novel regulatory mechanism by which low mtDNA content generates EMT and cancer stem cells in hMECs.Oncogene advance online publication , 4 November 2013 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.467 .	
24260485_s0	In normal tissues , strict control of tissue size is achieved by regulating cell numbers .	
24260485_s1	The mechanism that controls total cell number is known as contact inhibition of growth and it depends on the NF2/Merlin pathway .	
24260485_s2	Negative regulation of this pathway by deleterious mutations or by oncogenes results in cell transformation and tumor progression .	
24260485_s3	Here we provide evidence that the CD43 sialomucin cooperates with oncogenic signals to promote cell transformation by abrogating the contact inhibition of growth through a molecular mechanism that involves AKT-dependent Merlin phosphorylation and degradation .	evading growth suppressors
24260485_s4	Accordingly , inhibition of endogenous CD43 expression by RNA interference in lung , cervix and colon human cancer cells impaired tumor growth in vivo .	
24260485_s5	These data underscore a previously unidentified role for CD43 in non-hematopoietic tumor progression .	
24280290_s0	BACKGROUND Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a fatal plasma cell malignancy exhibiting enhanced glucose consumption associated with an aerobic glycolytic phenotype ( i.e. , the Warburg effect ) .	
24280290_s1	We have previously demonstrated that myeloma cells exhibit constitutive plasma membrane ( PM ) localization of GLUT4 , consistent with the dependence of MM cells on this transporter for maintenance of glucose consumption rates , proliferative capacity , and viability .	
24280290_s2	The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular basis of constitutive GLUT4 plasma membrane localization in MM cells .	
24280290_s3	FINDINGS We have elucidated a novel mechanism through which myeloma cells achieve constitutive GLUT4 activation involving elevated expression of the Rab-GTPase activating protein AS160_v2 splice variant to promote the Warburg effect .	cellular energetics
24280290_s4	AS160_v2-positive MM cell lines display constitutive Thr642 phosphorylation , known to be required for inactivation of AS160 Rab-GAP activity .	
24280290_s5	Importantly , we show that enforced expression of AS160_v2 is required for GLUT4 PM translocation and activation in these select MM lines .	
24280290_s6	Furthermore , we demonstrate that ectopic expression of a full-length , phospho-deficient AS160 mutant is sufficient to impair constitutive GLUT4 cell surface residence , which is characteristic of MM cells .	
24280290_s7	CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to tie AS160 de-regulation to increased glucose consumption rates and the Warburg effect in cancer .	cellular energetics
24280290_s8	Future studies investigating connections between the insulin/IGF-1/AS160_v2/GLUT4 axis and FDG-PET positivity in myeloma patients are warranted and could provide rationale for therapeutically targeting this pathway in MM patients with advanced disease .	
24289616_s0	ANXA2 , a member of the annexin family , is overexpressed and plays important roles in tumor development .	
24289616_s1	However , the significance of ANXA2 expression in gastric carcinoma has not been clarified.To elucidate its roles in growth of gastric cancer , ANXA2 expression in SGC-7901 cells was inhibited with a designated siRNA , then cell proliferation , cell cycling , apoptosis and motility were determined by MTT assay , flow cytometry , Hoechst 33342 staining and wound healing assay , respectively .	
24289616_s2	To further assess the behavior of ANXA2 deleted SGC- 7901 cells , changes of microstructures were observed under fluorescence microscopy , laser scanning confocal microscopy and electron microscopy .	
24289616_s3	We found that inhibition of ANXA2 expression caused cell proliferation to decrease significantly with G1 arrest , motility to be reduced with changes in pseudopodia/filopodia structure and F-actin and Î²-tubulin expression , and apoptosis to be enhanced albeit without significance .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
24289616_s4	At the same time , ANXA2 deletion resulted in fewer pseudopodia/filopodia , non-stained areas were increased , contact inhibition among cells reappeared , and expression of F-actin and Î²-tubulin was decreased , with induction of polymerized disassembled forms .	evading growth suppressors
24289616_s5	Taken together , these data suggest that ANXA2 overexpression is important to maintain the malignancy of cancer cells , and this member of the annexin family has potential to be considered as a target for the gene therapy of gastric carcinoma .	
24316222_s0	Hypoxia has long been linked to the Warburg effect , yet the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear .	
24316222_s1	It is also not known if lncRNAs are involved in the contribution of hypoxia to the Warburg effect .	
24316222_s2	Here we show that lincRNA-p21 is a hypoxia-responsive lncRNA and is essential for hypoxia-enhanced glycolysis .	cellular energetics
24316222_s3	Hypoxia/HIF-1α-induced lincRNA-p21 is able to bind HIF-1α and VHL and thus disrupts the VHL-HIF-1α interaction .	
24316222_s4	This disassociation attenuates VHL-mediated HIF-1α ubiquitination and causes HIF-1α accumulation .	
24316222_s5	These data indicate the existence of a positive feedback loop between HIF-1α and lincRNA-p21 that promotes glycolysis under hypoxia .	cellular energetics
24316222_s6	The ability of lincRNA-p21 to promote tumor growth is validated in mouse xenograft models .	
24316222_s7	Together , these findings suggest that lincRNA-p21 is an important player in the regulation of the Warburg effect and also implicate lincRNA-p21 as a valuable therapeutic target for cancer .	cellular energetics
24328532_s0	Aims : RAS-induced tumorigenesis has been suggested to follow a three-stage model consisting of an initial RAS activation , senescence induction , and evasion of p53-dependent senescence checkpoints .	
24328532_s1	While reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) act as second messengers in RAS-induced senescence , they are also involved in oncogenic transformation by inducing proliferation and promoting mutations .	
24328532_s2	In the current work , we investigated the role of extracellular superoxide dismutase ( SOD3 ) in RAS-induced senescence and immortalization in vitro and in vivo .	
24328532_s3	We used a mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) primary cell model together with immortalized and transformed human cell lines derived from papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer .	
24328532_s4	Results : Based on our data , sod3 RNA interference in H-RasV12-transduced cells markedly inhibited cell growth , while sod3 over-expression in MEFs initially caused a proliferative burst followed by the activation of DNA damage checkpoints , induction of p53-p21 signal transduction , and senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
24328532_s5	Subsequently , sod3-transduced MEF cells developed co-operative p21-p16 down-regulation and acquired transformed cell characteristics such as increased telomerase activity , loss of contact inhibition , growth in low-nutrient conditions , and in vivo tumorigenesis .	enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors
24328532_s6	Interestingly , as reported previously with RAS , we showed a dose-dependent response to SOD3 in vitro and in vivo involving transcriptional and non-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms .	
24328532_s7	Innovation : SOD3 may mediate H-RasV12-induced initiation of primary cell immortalization .	enabling replicative immortality,tumor promoting inflammation
24328532_s8	Conclusions : Our results indicate that SOD3 influences growth signaling in primary and cancer cells downstream of the ras oncogene and could serve as a therapy target at an early tumorigenesis phase .	sustaining proliferative signaling,tumor promoting inflammation
24343302_s0	Tumour cells primarily utilize aerobic glycolysis for energy production , a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect .	
24343302_s1	Its mechanism is not well understood .	
24343302_s2	The tumour suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in tumours .	
24343302_s3	Many tumour-associated mutant p53 ( mutp53 ) proteins not only lose tumour suppressive function but also gain new oncogenic functions that are independent of wild-type p53 , defined as mutp53 gain of function ( GOF ) .	
24343302_s4	Here we show that tumour-associated mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect in cultured cells and mutp53 knockin mice as a new mutp53 GOF .	cellular energetics
24343302_s5	Mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect through promoting GLUT1 translocation to the plasma membrane , which is mediated by activated RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK .	cellular energetics
24343302_s6	Inhibition of RhoA/ROCK/GLUT1 signalling largely abolishes mutp53 GOF in stimulating the Warburg effect .	cellular energetics
24343302_s7	Furthermore , inhibition of glycolysis in tumour cells greatly compromises mutp53 GOF in promoting tumorigenesis .	cellular energetics
24343302_s8	Thus , our results reveal a new mutp53 GOF and a mechanism for controlling the Warburg effect .	cellular energetics
24366173_s0	Our previous study demonstrated that 5-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) administered to mice stimulates oxidative phosphorylation by upregulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV enzyme cytochrome c oxidase ( COX ) .	
24366173_s1	The present study investigated whether ALA disrupts the Warburg effect , which represents a shift in ATP generation from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis , protecting tumor cells against oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis .	
24366173_s2	The human lung carcinoma cell line A549 exposed to ALA exhibited enhanced oxidative phosphorylation , which was indicated by an increase in COX protein expression and oxygen consumption .	
24366173_s3	Furthermore , ALA suppressed glycolysis-mediated acidosis .	cellular energetics
24366173_s4	This normalization of the ATP metabolic pathways significantly increased the generation of superoxide anion radical ( O2•- ) and the functional expression of active caspase-3 , leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis .	resisting cell death
24366173_s5	These data demonstrate that ALA inhibits the Warburg effect and induces cancer cell death .	cellular energetics
24366173_s6	Use of this endogenous compound might constitute a novel approach to cancer therapy .	
24367685_s0	Ceramide is a sphingolipid metabolite that induces cancer cell death .	
24367685_s1	When C6-ceramide is encapsulated in a nanoliposome bilayer formulation , cell death is selectively induced in tumor models .	
24367685_s2	However , the mechanism underlying this selectivity is unknown .	
24367685_s3	As most tumors exhibit a preferential switch to glycolysis , as described in the " Warburg effect " , we hypothesize that ceramide nanoliposomes selectively target this glycolytic pathway in cancer .	
24367685_s4	We utilize chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) as a cancer model , which has an increased dependency on glycolysis .	
24367685_s5	In CLL cells , we demonstrate that C6-ceramide nanoliposomes , but not control nanoliposomes , induce caspase 3/7-independent necrotic cell death .	resisting cell death
24367685_s6	Nanoliposomal ceramide inhibits both the RNA and protein expression of GAPDH , an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway , which is overexpressed in CLL .	cellular energetics
24367685_s7	To confirm that ceramide targets GAPDH , we demonstrate that downregulation of GAPDH potentiates the decrease in ATP after ceramide treatment and exogenous pyruvate treatment as well as GAPDH overexpression partially rescues ceramide-induced necrosis .	resisting cell death
24367685_s8	Finally , an in vivo murine model of CLL shows that nanoliposomal C6-ceramide treatment elicits tumor regression , concomitant with GAPDH downregulation .	
24367685_s9	We conclude that selective inhibition of the glycolytic pathway in CLL cells with nanoliposomal C6-ceramide could potentially be an effective therapy for leukemia by targeting the Warburg effect .	cellular energetics
24398380_s0	High-throughput screening of a small-molecule library identified a 5-triazolo-2-arylpyridazinone as a novel inhibitor of the important glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/2,6-bisphosphatase 3 ( PFKFB3 ) .	
24398380_s1	Such inhibitors are of interest due to PFKFB3's control of the important glycolytic pathway used by cancer cells to generate ATP .	
24398380_s2	A series of analogues was synthesized to study structure-activity relationships key to enzyme inhibition .	
24398380_s3	Changes to the triazolo or pyridazinone rings were not favoured , but limited-size substitutions on the aryl ring provided modest increases in potency against the enzyme .	
24398380_s4	Selected analogues and literature-described inhibitors were evaluated for their ability to suppress the glycolytic pathway , as detected by a decrease in lactate production , but none of these compounds demonstrated such suppression at non-cytotoxic concentrations .	cellular energetics
24477458_s0	Aberrant glucose metabolism characterized by high levels of glycolysis , even in the presence of oxygen , is an important hallmark of cancer .	
24477458_s1	This metabolic reprogramming referred to as the Warburg effect is essential to the survival of tumor cells and provides them with substrates required for biomass generation .	
24477458_s2	Molecular mechanisms responsible for this shift in glucose metabolism remain elusive .	
24477458_s3	As described herein , we found that aberrant expression of the proinflammatory protein transglutaminase 2 ( TG2 ) is an important regulator of the Warburg effect in mammary epithelial cells .	cellular energetics,tumor promoting inflammation
24477458_s4	Mechanistically , TG2 regulated metabolic reprogramming by constitutively activating nuclear factor ( NF)-κB , which binds to the hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF)-1α promoter and induces its expression even under normoxic conditions .	
24477458_s5	TG2/NF-κB-induced increase in HIF-1α expression was associated with increased glucose uptake , increased lactate production and decreased oxygen consumption by mitochondria .	
24477458_s6	Experimental suppression of TG2 attenuated HIF-1α expression and reversed downstream events in mammary epithelial cells .	
24477458_s7	Moreover , downregulation of p65/RelA or HIF-1α expression in these cells restored normal glucose uptake , lactate production , mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic protein expression .	cellular energetics
24477458_s8	Our results suggest that aberrant expression of TG2 is a master regulator of metabolic reprogramming and facilitates metabolic alterations in epithelial cells even under normoxic conditions .	
24477458_s9	A TG2-induced shift in glucose metabolism helps breast cancer cells to survive under stressful conditions and promotes their metastatic competence .	activating invasion and metastasis,cellular energetics

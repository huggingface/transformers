11857413_s0	Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) has emerged as one of the most important angiogenic growth factors from experimental in vitro and in vivo studies .	
11857413_s1	In the present study , we investigated the relationship between VEGF expression and microvessel density ( MVD ) and defined their prognostic relevance on a series of 242 patients with node-negative breast cancer , using immunohistochemical methods .	
11857413_s2	In parallel , estrogen and progesterone receptors were quantitatively assessed using the dextran-charcoal technique and cell proliferation was evaluated as S-phase cell fraction according to ( 3)H-thymidine-labeling index ( TLI ) .	
11857413_s3	The percentage of VEGF-expressing cells varied from 0-95% in the different tumors and was unrelated to menopausal status , tumor size or steroid receptor status .	inducing angiogenesis
11857413_s4	Conversely , a significant inverse relation was observed with patient age or tumor cell proliferation , albeit with very poor correlation coefficients .	
11857413_s5	A significant relation was observed between VEGF expression and MVD ( r(s) = 0.55 , p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	
11857413_s6	Clinical outcome analyzed as a function of high and low VEGF expression showed slight differences in terms of both disease-free survival ( DFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) that never reached statistical significance .	
11857413_s7	Moreover , the trend was paradoxically in favor of patients with highly VEGF-expressing tumors .	
11857413_s8	Finally , DFS and OS curves , when analyzed as a function of VEGF expression or MVD , were superimposable .	
11857413_s9	In conclusion , our study did not highlight a prognostic relevance of VEGF expression in patients with node-negative breast cancer , as already observed for MVD .	
11888853_s0	OBJECTIVE To elucidate the direct effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRHa ) on the growth of human uterine leiomyoma cells , cell proliferation and apoptosis in cultured leiomyoma cells treated with GnRHa were investigated .	
11888853_s1	METHODS Isolated leiomyoma cells were subcultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 5 days and stepped down to serum-free conditions for an additional 6 days in the presence or absence of graded concentrations of GnRHa ( 10(-9) mol/l to 10(-12) mol/l ) .	
11888853_s2	The effects of GnRHa on the number of viable cells , expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) , Fas and Fas ligand , and apoptosis in cultured leiomyoma cells were examined by MTT ( 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide ) assay , immunocytochemical analysis , Western blot analysis and TUNEL assay respectively .	
11888853_s3	RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of GnRH receptor mRNA in cultured leiomyoma cells .	
11888853_s4	RESULTS Treatment with GnRHa resulted in a decrease in the number of cultured viable leiomyoma cells assessed by MTT assay in a dose-dependent manner compared with that in control cultures ( P&lt;0.01 ) .	
11888853_s5	The growth inhibition of cultured leiomyoma cells treated with GnRHa in concentrations higher than 10(-10) mol/l was associated with the suppression of the proliferative potential characterized by a decrease in PCNA-positive rate of the cultured cells ( P&lt;0.01 ) and an increase in the apoptosis-positive rate assessed by TUNEL assay ( P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01 ) .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
11888853_s6	GnRHa markedly increased the expression of Fas and induced the expression of Fas ligand in the cultured leiomyoma cells on the basis of Western blot analysis .	resisting cell death
11888853_s7	These direct effects of GnRHa on the number of viable cultured leiomyoma cells , PCNA-positive rate , apoptosis-positive rate and Fas/Fas ligand expression in the cultured leiomyoma cells were only attained after the 4-day treatment .	resisting cell death
11888853_s8	RT-PCR analysis revealed that GnRH receptor mRNA was expressed in cultured leiomyoma cells .	
11888853_s9	CONCLUSIONS The present results demonstrate that GnRHa directly inhibits the growth of human uterine leiomyoma cells by suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis , which might be associated with the increase in Fas expression and the induction of Fas ligand expression in the cells .	resisting cell death
11936957_s0	BACKGROUND Helicobacter pylori is the main risk factor for the development of non-cardia gastric cancer .	
11936957_s1	Increased proliferation of the gastric mucosa is a feature of H. pylori infection .	
11936957_s2	Mucosal interkeukin-1beta production is increased in H. pylori infection and IL-1beta genotypes associated with increased pro-inflammatory activity are risk factors for the development of gastric cancer .	
11936957_s3	The effect of IL-1beta on gastric epithelial cell proliferation has been examined in this study .	
11936957_s4	METHODS AGS cells were cultured with IL-1beta .	
11936957_s5	DNA synthesis was assed by [ 3H]thymidine incorporation and total viable cell numbers by MTT assay .	
11936957_s6	RESULTS IL-1beta dose dependently increased DNA synthesis and cell numbers .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11936957_s7	The enhanced proliferation was blocked by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11936957_s8	Addition of neutralising antibody to GM-CSF reduced IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation by 31 +/- 4 % .	
11936957_s9	GM-CSF alone significantly stimulated proliferation .	
11936957_s10	Addition or neutralisation of IL-8 had no effect on basal or IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation .	
11936957_s11	The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein completely blocked IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation and inhibition of the extracellular signal related kinase pathway with PD 98059 inhibited IL-1beta stimulated proliferation by 58 +/- 5 % .	
11936957_s12	CONCLUSIONS IL-1beta stimulates proliferation in gastric epithelial cells .	
11936957_s13	Autocrine stimulation by GM-CSF contributes to this proliferative response .	
11936957_s14	Signalling via tyrosine kinase activity is essential to the mitogenic response to IL-1beta .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11936957_s15	The extracellular signal related kinase pathway is involved in , but not essential to downstream signalling .	sustaining proliferative signaling
11936957_s16	IL-1beta may contribute to the hyperproliferation seen in H. pylori- infected gastric mucosa , and be involved in the carcinogenic process .	
11978176_s0	The in vitro immortalization of primary human mammary epithelial ( HME ) cells solely by the exogenous introduction of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase ( hTERT ) has been achieved .	
11978176_s1	Early passage hTERT-transfected HME ( T-HME ) cells continuously decreased the length and density of telomeres even in the presence of telomerase activity , with a significant number of cells staining positive for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase ( SA-beta-gal ) .	enabling replicative immortality
11978176_s2	Subsequently , with the increase in cell passages , the copy number of the exogenously transfected hTERT gene and the percentage of SA-beta-gal positive cells were found to decrease .	
11978176_s3	Eventually , a single copy of the exogenous hTERT gene was observed in the relatively later passage T-HME cells in which telomere length was elongated and stabilized without obvious activation of endogenous hTERT and c-Myc expression .	
11978176_s4	In T-HME cells , the expression of two p53 regulated genes p21(WAF) and HDM2 increased ( as in primary senescent HME cells ) , and was found to be further elevated as the function of p53 was activated by treatment with DNA-damaging agents. p16(INK4a) was shown to be significantly higher in the primary senescent HME and the early passage T-HME cells when compared with the primary presenescent HME cells , with a dramatic repression of p16(INK4a) observed in the later passage T-HME cells .	
11978176_s5	In addition , the expression of E2F1 and its transcription factor activity were found to be significantly higher in the later passage T-HME cells when compared with the earlier passage T-HME cells .	
11978176_s6	Together , our results indicate that in vitro immortalization in HME cells may require the activation of the function of telomerase and other genetic alterations such as the spontaneous loss of p16(INK4a) expression .	enabling replicative immortality
11980715_s0	The cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1) was identified initially as a gene induced in senescent cells and itself has been shown to cause permanent growth arrest/senescence .	
11980715_s1	Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , a byproduct of oxidative processes , can also induce an irreversible growth arrest similar to senescence .	
11980715_s2	Here we show that p21 increased intracellular levels of ROS both in normal fibroblasts and in p53-negative cancer cells .	tumor promoting inflammation
11980715_s3	N-acetyl-L-cysteine , an ROS inhibitor , rescued p21-induced senescence , showing that ROS elevation is necessary for induction of the permanent growth arrest phenotype. p16(Ink4a) , a CDK4- and CDK6-specific inhibitor , failed to increase ROS levels , and cell cycle arrest induced by p16 was reversible following its down-regulation , demonstrating the specificity of this p21 effect .	
11980715_s4	A p21 mutant that lacked the ability to bind proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) retained the ability to induce both ROS and permanent growth arrest .	sustaining proliferative signaling,tumor promoting inflammation
11980715_s5	All of these findings establish that p21 mediates senescence by a mechanism involving ROS accumulation which does not require either its PCNA binding or the CDK inhibitory functions shared with p16 .	sustaining proliferative signaling,tumor promoting inflammation
12041507_s0	In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which tumour-specific CD4+ T-cell responses are impaired during tumour development , an attempt was made to identify factors which impair CD4+ T-cell responses at a late tumour-bearing stage .	
12041507_s1	Plasma from mice bearing B16 melanoma for 30 days ( plasma d30 ) showed a more profound immunosuppressive effect on the in vitro proliferation of unrelated antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the presence of both antigen and antigen-presenting cells ( APC ) than plasma from naï¿½ve mice .	avoiding immune destruction
12041507_s2	The level of plasma transforming growth factor ( TGF)- was elevated in mice bearing B16 melanoma for 30 days compared with naï¿½ve mice , and the suppressive effect of plasma d30 was partially diminished by the neutralization of TGF- .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12041507_s3	Interestingly , immunoglobulin ( IgG)-bound TGF- , but not IgG-unbound TGF- , in plasma d30 was suggested to be responsible for the immunosuppressive activity .	avoiding immune destruction
12041507_s4	In addition , no suppressive effect of plasma d30 was observed when antigen was added as a class II peptide , thus suggesting that the impaired proliferation of CD4+ T cells in the presence of plasma d30 was due to a dysfunction of antigen uptake/processing by APC .	
12041507_s5	Furthermore , dissociation between IgG and TGF- resulted in a loss of the suppressive activity of plasma d30 .	
12041507_s6	Taken together , these results suggest that circulating IgG-bound TGF- is , at least in part , responsible for the impaired responses of CD4+ T cells at the late tumour-bearing stage by suppressing antigen uptake/ processing by APC .	
12097282_s0	Glioblastoma multiforme , the most common form of malignant brain tumor,is resistant to all forms of therapy and causes death within 9-12 months of diagnosis .	
12097282_s1	Glioblastomas are known to contain numerous genetic and physiological alterations affecting cell survival and proliferation ; one of the most common alterations being platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) autocrine signaling characterized by coexpression of PDGF and its receptor .	
12097282_s2	The PDGF family consists of four members , PDGF-A , -B , -C , and -D , that signal through the alpha and beta PDGF receptor ( PDGFR ) tyrosine kinases .	
12097282_s3	Numerous studies have demonstrated expression of PDGF-A , PDGF-B , and the PDGFRs in gliomablastomas , but such studies have not been conducted for the newly identified PDGF-C and -D .	
12097282_s4	Therefore , we examined the expression of all PDGF ligands and receptors in 11 glioma cell lines and 5 primary glioblastoma tumor tissues by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR .	
12097282_s5	Expression of PDGF/PDGFR pairs that are known to functionally interact were identified in all of the samples .	
12097282_s6	Interestingly , PDGF-C expression was ubiquitous in brain tumor cells and tissues but was very low or absent in normal adult and fetal brain .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12097282_s7	PDGF-D was expressed in 10 of 11 brain tumor cell lines and 3 of 5 primary brain tumor samples .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12097282_s8	As a strategy for blocking PDGFR signaling , CT52923 , a potent selective small molecule piperazinyl quinazoline kinase inhibitor of the PDGFR , was identified .	
12097282_s9	In model systems using NIH/3T3 cells , CT52923 blocked PDGF autocrine-mediated phosphorylation of PDGFR , Akt , and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , while having no effect on v-fms or V12-ras-mediated Akt or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ( Erk ) phosphorylation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12097282_s10	More importantly , p.o. administration of CT52923 to nude mice caused a significant 61% reduction ( P &lt ; 0.006 ) in tumor growth of NIH/3T3 cells transformed by PDGF , whereas tumor formation by cells expressing v-fms was unaffected .	
12097282_s11	We next characterized PDGF autocrine signaling in five glioblastoma cell lines .	
12097282_s12	In all of the cases , PDGF autocrine signaling was evident because treatment with 1-10 microM CT52923 inhibited PDGFR autophosphorylation when present at a detectable level and blocked downstream Akt and/or Erk phosphorylation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12097282_s13	The functional significance of PDGF autocrine signaling in these cells was demonstrated by the fact that the CT52923 inhibited soft agar colony formation , and , when given p.o. to nude mice , it effectively reduced tumor formation by 44% ( P &lt ; 0.0019 ) after s.c. injection of C6 glioblastoma cells .	
12097282_s14	This study of glioblastoma cells and primary tissues is the first to implicate PDGF-C and -D in brain tumor formation and confirms the existence of autocrine signaling by PDGF-A and -B .	
12097282_s15	More importantly , treatment with the PDGFR antagonist CT52923 inhibited survival and/or mitogenic pathways in all of the glioblastoma cell lines tested and prevented glioma formation in a nude mouse xenograft model .	
12097282_s16	Together these findings demonstrate the potential therapeutic utility of this class of compounds for the treatment of glioblastoma .	
12217878_s0	Enhanced glycolysis represents a striking feature of cancers and can therefore serve to indicate a malignant transformation .	
12217878_s1	We have developed a noninvasive , quantitative method to characterize tumor glycolysis by monitoring ( 13)C-labeled glucose and lactate with magnetic resonance spectroscopy .	
12217878_s2	This method was applied in MCF7 human breast cancer implanted in the mammary gland of female CD1-NU mice and was further employed to assess tumor response to hormonal manipulation with the antiestrogen tamoxifen .	
12217878_s3	Analysis of the kinetic data based on a unique physiological-metabolic model yielded the rate parameters of glycolysis , glucose perfusion , and lactate clearance in the tumor , as well as glucose pharmacokinetics in the plasma .	
12217878_s4	Treatment with tamoxifen induced a twofold reduction in the rate of glycolysis and of lactate clearance but did not affect the other parameters .	cellular energetics
12217878_s5	This metabolic monitoring can thus serve to evaluate the efficacy of new selective estrogen receptor modulators and may be further extended to improve diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer .	
12239604_s0	We showed in a previous study that soluble low-molecular-mass tumor-associated antigens ( sTAA ) promote the anti-tumor effect of the anticancer drug cyclophosphamide ( CPA ) on rat mammary carcinogenesis .	
12239604_s1	In this report , we analyzed the possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon .	
12239604_s2	Studies were performed on the bone marrow and thymus from the following groups of rats : i ) control rats , ii ) rats treated with sTAA , iii ) rats treated with CPA , iv ) rats treated with CPA and sTAA .	
12239604_s3	The cellular content of the bone marrow and thymus ( CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes ) was analyzed morphometrically and immunohistochemically .	
12239604_s4	In the bone marrow , CPA caused significant substitution of cellular components with fatty tissue whereas sTAA repaired this process .	
12239604_s5	We found that CPA affects mainly the process of myelogenesis whereas sTAA protect the production of lymphocytes .	
12239604_s6	In the thymus , CPA alone or in combination with sTAA repaired the inhibition effect of DMBA on synthesis of CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes. sTAA further increased the amount of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the medulla of the thymus .	
12239604_s7	Data in the literature as well as the findings presented here demonstrate that the tested treatment , including vaccination with sTAA , actively promotes the generation of the host's antitumor immune response .	avoiding immune destruction
12239968_s0	BACKGROUND/AIMS Endoscopic mucosal resection and laparoscopic wedge resection have become more common in the treatment of early gastric cancer .	
12239968_s1	However , lymph node metastasis is a major poor prognostic factor influencing tumor recurrence and survival .	
12239968_s2	To predict the risk of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer , the authors conducted a study to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of early gastric cancer with lymph node metastasis .	
12239968_s3	METHODOLOGY From 1982 to 1998 , 181 patients of early gastric cancer underwent primary surgery and were included in the study .	
12239968_s4	Patient data was postoperatively reviewed regarding age , gender , tumor size , depth of invasion , histologic differentiation , macroscopic classification and anatomic level of lymph node metastasis .	
12239968_s5	The chi 2 test or Student's t test was used for statistical analysis .	
12239968_s6	Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis .	
12239968_s7	RESULTS Lymph node metastasis was observed in 19 cases ( 11% ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
12239968_s8	Early gastric cancer with size larger than 4 cm ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) , with submucosal invasion ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) , and with poor differentiation ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) was associated with higher risk of lymph node metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
12239968_s9	The macroscopic classification had no predictive value .	
12239968_s10	Multivariate analysis showed that submucosal invasion correlated best with lymph node spread ( OR 10.25 , 95% CI : 2.10-49.96 ) , followed by tumor size larger than 4 cm ( OR 4.99 , 95% CI : 1.46-17.05 ) , and poorly differentiated histological subtype ( OR 3.31 , 95% CI : 1.16-9.45 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
12239968_s11	CONCLUSIONS Poor differentiation , submucosal invasion and large tumor size were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis
12239968_s12	Macroscopic classification was not correlated with lymph node metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
12370496_s0	We investigated the mode of cell death induced by the anthracyclines , aclarubicin , doxorubicin and daunorubicin in the human leukemia cell lines , HL60 and Jurkat .	
12370496_s1	The cells were incubated with drug concentrations up to 500 nM for periods between 3 and 24 hours , followed by morphological and biochemical analyses .	
12370496_s2	All three substances induced DNA fragmentation , evident as DNA laddering and appearance of cells with hypodiploid DNA content , externalization of phosphatidyl serine , activation of caspases and degradation of the apoptosis-specific endonuclease inhibitor DFF45 .	resisting cell death
12370496_s3	However , concentrations and times necessary for these effects to occur were different , aclarubicin being the quickest acting drug with a lag phase of 3 h , followed by daunorubicin with 6 h and doxorubicin with 24 h .	
12370496_s4	More importantly , aclarubicin induced these effects while the cell membrane was intact , whereas doxorubicin and daunorubicin led to immediate loss of membrane integrity .	
12370496_s5	Programmed cell death is characterised by preservation of membrane integrity in order to allow removal of apoptotic bodies , whereas cell rupture is an early event in necrosis .	resisting cell death
12370496_s6	We therefore suggest that , in our experimental settings , doxorubicin- and daunorubicin-induced cell death occurs by necrosis , while aclarubicin induces programmed cell death .	resisting cell death
12391022_s0	A persistent immune response to hepatitis viruses is a well-recognized risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma .	
12391022_s1	However , the molecular and cellular basis for the procarcinogenic potential of the immune response is not well defined .	
12391022_s2	Here , using a unique animal model of chronic hepatitis that induces hepatocellular carcinogenesis , we demonstrate that neutralization of the activity of Fas ligand prevented hepatocyte apoptosis , proliferation , liver inflammation , and the eventual development of hepatocellular carcinoma .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
12391022_s3	The results indicate that Fas ligand is involved not only in direct hepatocyte killing but also in the process of inflammation and hepatocellular carcinogenesis in chronic hepatitis .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
12391022_s4	This is the first demonstration that amelioration of chronic inflammation by some treatment actually caused reduction of cancer development .	tumor promoting inflammation
12399129_s0	Prognosis of patients with non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) remains difficult to assess , even after adjustment for pathological stage .	
12399129_s1	Prognostic value of numerous biological markers has been evaluated , with conflicting results .	
12399129_s2	Data of 86 patients with NSCLC treated by surgery were collected with clinical characteristics , histopathological data including tumor differentiation and status of blood and lymphatic vessel invasion and evaluation by immunohistochemistry of Rb , Bcl-2 and Ki-67 expression .	
12399129_s3	Prognostic values for overall survival ( OS ) and event-free survival ( EFS ) were analyzed by the log tank test and the multivariable Cox model .	
12399129_s4	Using univariable analyses , pT , pN , poor differentiation or large cell subtype were associated with a poor OS , while lymphatic and/or blood vessel invasion were associated with a short EFS .	activating invasion and metastasis
12399129_s5	None of the molecular markers had a significant prognostic value for either outcome .	
12399129_s6	In multivariable analyses , only stage remained of prognostic value for OS .	
12399129_s7	Interestingly , the presence of blood vascular invasion in the tumor was significantly predictive for subsequent metastatic occurrence in stages I and II .	activating invasion and metastasis
12399129_s8	This feature might , therefore , be relevant for administration of adjuvant therapy in completely resected NSCLC .	
12417599_s0	BACKGROUND A retrospective study was performed to determine the indications for positron emission tomography ( PET ) using [ (18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) in patients with esophageal cancer , including those with early cancer , and to investigate whether the tumor-to-normal ratio ( T/N ratio ) could be used as a substitute for the standardized uptake value ( SUV ) .	
12417599_s1	METHODS Thirty-six patients were included in the study .	
12417599_s2	Thirty-one patients who had 36 biopsy-proven lesions ( 35 squamous cell carcinomas and one small cell carcinoma ) underwent PET study prior to treatment .	
12417599_s3	PET images were evaluated visually and the relationship between the depth of invasion and the PET findings were examined in 22 lesions of 19 patients from whom specimens were obtained from the primary tumor by surgery or endoscopic mucosal resection .	
12417599_s4	PET results were also compared with computed tomography ( CT ) and endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) for detection of regional lymph node metastases in 18 patients who underwent extended lymph node dissection .	
12417599_s5	Five patients underwent PET studies for the detection of recurrence and the PET findings were compared with their CT findings .	
12417599_s6	The T/N ratio and the SUV were calculated for 20 primary tumors .	
12417599_s7	RESULTS Among the 15 tumors that were pT1b or greater , all 15 were positive on PET and all seven of the lesions confined to the mucosa ( Tis or T1a ) were negative .	
12417599_s8	The sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of detecting nodal involvement were , respectively , 37.5 , 96.1 and 88.3% by CT , 30.8 , 88.5 and 81.0% by EUS and 41.7 , 100 and 92.2% by PET .	
12417599_s9	More sites of recurrence were detected by PET than by CT .	
12417599_s10	There was no statistically significant correlation between the SUV and the T/N ratio .	
12417599_s11	CONCLUSIONS PET imaging can detect primary esophageal cancer with a depth of invasion of T1b or greater , but Tis and T1a tumors are undetectable .	activating invasion and metastasis
12417599_s12	PET seems to be more accurate than CT or EUS for diagnosing lymph node metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis
12417599_s13	The T/N ratio cannot be used as a substitute for the SUV .	
12420217_s0	During papillomavirus infection , the E5 protein localizes in the cell Golgi apparatus and other endomembrane compartments .	
12420217_s1	Cells transformed by E5 do not express major histocompatibility class I complex ( MHC I ) on the cell surface , while cells transformed by the other transforming proteins E6 and E7 do .	
12420217_s2	In addition , the total amount of both MHC I protein and mRNA is reduced in E5-transformed cells .	
12420217_s3	Here we show that expression of bovine papillomavirus E5 causes the retention of MHC I in the Golgi apparatus , thus preventing its transport to the cell surface .	
12420217_s4	We ascribe this effect to a failure of acidification of the Golgi apparatus , as similar effects are observed in control cells treated with the ionophore monensin .	
12420217_s5	Treatment of E5-transformed cells with either beta- or gamma-interferon increases the synthesis of MHC I , showing that inhibition of MHC I expression by E5 is not irreversible .	
12420217_s6	However , even after interferon treatment , MHC I , although increased in quantity , is not transported to the cell surface .	
12420217_s7	E5 therefore affects MHC I at several levels , but prevention of MHC I transport to the cell surface appears to be the dominant effect .	
12420217_s8	Lack of surface MHC I would have profound consequences for presentation of viral peptides to the immune system .	avoiding immune destruction
12457038_s0	Estrogen affects apoptotic cell death in estrogen-responsive tissues .	
12457038_s1	The purpose of the present study was to examine dynamic changes in apoptotic cell death in the anterior pituitary gland during the estrous cycle and to investigate neuroendocrine regulation of these changes in cycling female rats .	
12457038_s2	Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling ( TUNEL ) for in situ detection of DNA strand breaks revealed that the number of TUNEL-positive anterior pituitary cells was changing during the estrous cycle , with a maximum in the morning of proestrus and a minimum in the morning of estrus .	genomic instability and mutation,resisting cell death
12457038_s3	A similar pattern was observed with Bax immunostaining ; however , no difference was observed in Bcl-2 immunostaining .	
12457038_s4	Most of Bax-immunoreactive cells were identified as a subpopulation of gonadotropes .	
12457038_s5	Pentobarbital administered in the afternoon of proestrus attenuated the decrease in TUNEL-positive or Bax-immunoreactive cells in the morning of estrus , although estradiol treatment failed to affect it .	
12457038_s6	This action of pentobarbital was reduced by simultaneous treatment with an ovulation-inducing dose of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) , but not with progesterone , an ovarian steroid also released after GnRH treatment .	
12457038_s7	These results suggest that anterior pituitary cells , mostly gonadotropes , undergo a cyclic change in apoptotic cell death during the estrous cycle and that the inhibition of apoptosis on estrus is due , at least in part , to the proestrous surge of GnRH secretion .	resisting cell death
12486015_s0	The RuvABC and RecBCD proteins promote rescue of stalled or broken DNA replication forks in Escherichia coli .	
12486015_s1	Strains lacking these proteins cope poorly with DNA damage and have problems with chromosome segregation and cell division .	
12486015_s2	We show how these difficulties are overcome to varying degrees by a sub-class of RNA polymerase mutations selected for their stringent phenotype .	genomic instability and mutation
12486015_s3	Thirty-five mutations were sequenced .	genomic instability and mutation
12486015_s4	All but one change single amino acids in RpoB or RpoC that lie on or near the path taken by DNA through the enzyme , indicating they may affect the stability of transcription complexes .	
12486015_s5	Four mutant enzymes are shown to form unstable open complexes at the lambdacro promoter .	
12486015_s6	At least one may also release stalled complexes or limit their formation , as it reduces the need for reactivation of transcription by GreA or GreB , and for transcription-coupled DNA repair of UV damage by Mfd .	genomic instability and mutation
12486015_s7	The results shed light on the interplay between DNA replication and transcription and suggest ways in which conflicts between these two vital cellular processes are avoided or resolved .	
12499255_s0	The Sonic hedgehog ( SHH ) pathway is implicated in the etiology of the most common human cancer in Caucasians , the basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) .	
12499255_s1	Mutations in the receptor of SHH , the patched gene , have been characterized in sporadic BCCs as well as those from patients with the rare genetic syndromes nevoid BCC and xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) .	
12499255_s2	To elucidate the role of UV in the deregulation of the SHH pathway , we analyzed for alterations of smoothened , a transmembrane signaling component regulated by patched , in BCCs and squamous cell carcinomas from UV hypersensitive XP patients .	
12499255_s3	We find UV-specific smoothened mutations in 30% of XP BCCs , three times higher than those in sporadic Caucasian BCCs , confirming the high rate of UV-induced mutations in DNA repair-deficient XP patients .	genomic instability and mutation
12499255_s4	No alteration was found in XP squamous cell carcinomas , indicating the involvement of smoothened specifically in the development of BCC .	
12509260_s0	Cancer-prone diseases ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) , Nijmegen breakage syndrome ( NBS ) and ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder ( ATLD ) are defective in the repair of DNA double-stranded break ( DSB ) .	
12509260_s1	On the other hand , arsenic ( As ) has been reported to cause DSB and to be involved in the occurrence of skin , lung and bladder cancers .	
12509260_s2	To dissect the repair mechanism of As-induced DSB , wild type , AT and NBS cells were treated with sodium arsenite to study the complex formation and post-translational modification of Rad50/NBS1/Mre11 repair proteins .	
12509260_s3	Our results showed that Mre11 went through cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation upon sodium arsenite treatment and this post-translational modification required NBS1 but not ATM .	evading growth suppressors
12509260_s4	Defective As-induced Mre11 phosphorylation was rescued by reconstitution with full length NBS1 in NBS cells .	
12509260_s5	Although As-induced Mre11 phosphorylation was not required for Rad50/NBS1/Mre11 complex formation , it might be required for the formation of Rad50/NBS1/Mre11 nuclear foci upon DNA damage .	
12509276_s0	In both mitotic and meiotic processes , cellular surveillance of the integrity of genetic information transmission from parental cells to their subsequent generations is carried out by a network of proteins primarily involved in cell-cycle regulation , DNA replication , DNA repair , and chromosome segregation .	
12509276_s1	Within this context , the mammalian MRE11 represents an essential multifunctional protein that promotes repair of DNA double-strand breaks and plays a role in the signaling of DNA damage response .	
12509276_s2	Mutations in human hMRE11 gene could contribute to the rare " AT-like " disorder .	
12509276_s3	However , at present time the functional roles of hMRE11 in these cellular processes are elusive .	
12509276_s4	In the current study , we provide evidence that hMRE11 interacts physically with the mismatch repair protein hMLH1 through yeast two-hybrid analysis .	genomic instability and mutation
12509276_s5	In addition , we show that recombinant hMRE11 and hMLH1 proteins interact when these two proteins are coexpressed in bacterial cells , and both proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from human cell extracts .	genomic instability and mutation
12509276_s6	Furthermore , hMRE11 and hMLH1 display similar expression patterns when examined with a human normal/tumor DNA array .	genomic instability and mutation
12509276_s7	Together , these data suggest that hMRE11 and hMLH1 might act in a co-operative fashion during DNA damage detection , signaling , and repair .	genomic instability and mutation
12530056_s0	The vinorelbine sensitivity of eight recently established head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) cell lines was tested using the 96-well plate clonogenic assay .	
12530056_s1	The chemosensitivity of these head and neck SCC cell lines to vinorelbine expressed as IC50 , corresponding to the drug concentration causing 50% inhibition in clonogenic survival , varied between 0.6 and 1.0 nM .	
12530056_s2	The dose-dependent growth inhibition caused by vinorelbine was measured in three of these cell lines .	
12530056_s3	A clear growth inhibition was observed at a concentration of 3 nM .	
12530056_s4	The same cell lines were studied with flow cytometry .	
12530056_s5	When exposed to 3 nM and 5 nM vinorelbine , an accumulation of the cells in the G2/M-phase was observed in all cultures after 12 hours .	sustaining proliferative signaling
12530056_s6	The morphological changes induced by 3 nM and 5 nM vinorelbine to the UT-SCC-33 cell line were analysed with time-lapse video microscopy .	
12530056_s7	In the cultures treated with 5 nM vinorelbine , the cells stayed mitotically arrested for 2-32 hours and thereafter died morphologically by apoptosis .	resisting cell death
12530056_s8	These results indicate that , in vitro , the head and neck SCC is consistently sensitive to vinorelbine , which blocks the cell cycle in G2/M , the most radiosensitive phase .	evading growth suppressors
12530056_s9	These encouraging results suggest that vinorelbine may potentially be used in conjunction with radiotherapy in the treatment of head and neck SCC .	
12533047_s0	Mast cells ( MC ) are critical for a number of pathological conditions , including acute and chronic inflammation and tumor angiogenesis .	
12533047_s1	We have previously demonstrated that in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( B-NHL ) angiogenesis is correlated with total methachromatic and tryptase-positive MC and that both counts increase in step with the increase in malignancy , whereas the role of MC in malignant lymph nodes is not fully clear .	
12533047_s2	An extensive ultrastructural study has been made of representative samples of 30 B-NHL and 10 benign lymphadenopathies .	
12533047_s3	A heterogeneous population of MC characterized by the presence of granules with a semilunar aspect and containing scrolls was observed .	
12533047_s4	The former are the expression of a slow but progressive release of angiogenic factors due to chronic , progressive stimulation of MC degranulation , while the latter contain tryptase , an angiogenic factor .	inducing angiogenesis
12533047_s5	These two ultrastructural data confirm the important role played by MC in the angiogenesis associated with progression in B-NHL .	inducing angiogenesis
12550055_s0	Epidemiological studies suggest that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) may influence breast cancer progression and prognosis .	
12550055_s1	In order to study potential mechanisms of action of fatty acid modulation of tumor growth , we studied , in vitro , the influence of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on proliferation , cell cycle , differentiation and apoptosis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells .	
12550055_s2	Both eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) inhibited the MCF-7 cell growth by 30% and 54% , respectively , while linoleic acid ( LA ) had no effect and arachidonic acid ( AA ) inhibited the cell growth by 30% ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
12550055_s3	The addition of vitamin E ( 10uM ) to cancer cells slightly restored cell growth .	
12550055_s4	The incubation of MCF-7 cells with PUFAs did not alter the cell cycle parameters or induce cell apoptosis .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
12550055_s5	However , the growth inhibitory effects of EPA , DHA and AA were associated with cell differentiation as indicated by positive Oil-Red-O staining of the cells .	
12550055_s6	Lipid droplet accumulation was increased by 65% , 30% and 15% in the presence of DHA , EPA and AA , respectively ; ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
12550055_s7	These observations suggest that fatty acids may influence cellular processes at a molecular level , capable of modulating breast cancer cell growth .	
12553004_s0	Chinese medicinal herbs are traditionally used to prevent and treat a variety of diseases , including cancer .	
12553004_s1	These herbal preparations are purported to have many biological effects including direct antiproliferative effects on cancer cells , anti-mutagenic activity , and stimulatory or suppressive effects on immune responses .	
12553004_s2	The present study investigates the effects of aqueous extracts from seventy-one Chinese medicinal herbs on the growth of five breast cancer cell lines ( SK-BR-3 , MCF7 , MDA-MB-231 , BT-474 and MCNeuA ) .	
12553004_s3	Twenty-one percent ( 15 out of 71 ) of the extracts demonstrated greater than 50% growth inhibition on at least 4 of the 5 cell lines .	
12553004_s4	Dose-response curves were obtained for several of the most potent crude extracts and demonstrated IC50 values ranging from &lt ; 10 micrograms/ml to &gt ; 1 mg/ml .	
12553004_s5	Six of seven herbs tested induced high molecular weight DNA fragmentation , an early marker of apoptosis , while one of these also induced low molecular weight DNA fragmentation .	resisting cell death
12553004_s6	Flow cytometric analysis of breast cancer cells exposed to one of these herbs ( Rheum palmatum ) suggested that it arrests cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle .	evading growth suppressors
12553004_s7	These results indicate that many of the herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of cancer have significant growth inhibitory effects on breast cancer cells in vitro .	
12579213_s0	During the period of 1996-1998 ninety-four gastrectomy specimens with gastric carcinoma referred to Erciyes University , Medical Faculty , Department of Pathology , were examined histopathologically , histochemically and immunohistochemically .	
12579213_s1	General characteristics of gastric carcinomas and prognostic factors were studied .	
12579213_s2	According the Lauren classification , of the 94 cases of gastric carcinomas , 56 were intestinal type , 21 were diffuse type and 17 were mixed type carcinoma .	
12579213_s3	The association rates of Helicobacter pylori , chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia with gastric carcinomas were high .	
12579213_s4	There was strong immunorectivity with HSP70 in 62,5% of the intestinal type carcinomas .	
12579213_s5	This ratios were lower in diffuse and mixed type carcinomas ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	
12579213_s6	The more tumor size and invasion depth increased , the more HSP70 immunoreactivity was obtained ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	
12579213_s7	HSP70 immunorectivity was considerably higher in the patients having lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
12579213_s8	It was found that the NK cell number was low in the tumor but higher around the tumor in early gastric carcinomas , compared with advanced carcinomas ( p&gt;0.05 ) .	
12579213_s9	In the tumors larger than 10 cm with vascular invasion , NK cell number was lower around the tumor ( p&gt;0.05 ) .	
12579213_s10	Defining prognostic factors of gastric carcinomas is of importance to clinicians .	
12579213_s11	It is thought that HSP70 immunoreactivity , besides invasion depth , lymph node metastasis , vascular invasion , tumor size and inflammatory reaction against the tumor , is important in prognosis and associated with advanced stage .	activating invasion and metastasis,tumor promoting inflammation
12581481_s0	This article describes the leading steps to develop an assay of DNA damage for the marine amphipod Gammarus locusta , using agarose gel electrophoresis ( AGE ) .	
12581481_s1	To test the sensitivity and feasibility of the AGE technique , X-ray assays were performed with naked DNA and with live amphipods .	
12581481_s2	These positive controls demonstrated the effectiveness of the AGE technique to not only discriminate distinct levels of DNA strand breakage in a dose-dependent manner , but also to identify and quantify the type of strand breakage induced .	
12581481_s3	It was also shown that it is possible to detect DNA damage using whole-body DNA extracts from amphipods .	
12581481_s4	To explore the potential of this technique for use in ecotoxicological studies with amphipods , a 96-h waterborne-copper toxicity test was performed .	
12581481_s5	Copper-induced DNA strand breakage was first observed after 24 h of exposure , and was recorded again at 96 h , at a copper concentration of 20 microg l(-1) .	genomic instability and mutation
12581481_s6	The absence of strand breakage after 48 h of exposure is discussed in the light of the underlying mechanisms of copper toxicity and DNA repair .	genomic instability and mutation
12581481_s7	These studies demonstrated the feasibility of including DNA damage as a biomarker in ecotoxicological studies with amphipods .	genomic instability and mutation
12581481_s8	Information gained from the use of this biomarker would help with the interpretation of chronic toxicity tests and would contribute to our understanding of the impact of genotoxic insult in marine invertebrates , particularly crustaceans .	
12635657_s0	Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in humans .	
12635657_s1	However , poor response to conventional therapeutic approaches , including chemotherapy , leads invariably to disease recurrence and progression .	
12635657_s2	The organo-tin derivative triethyltin(IV)lupinylsulfide hydrochloride ( IST-FS 29 ) was identified and developed as potential antiproliferative agent in human cancer cell lines .	
12635657_s3	However , for its peculiar chemical structure and good lipophilicity , this compound also appeared an eligible candidate for the treatment of gliobastoma cells .	
12635657_s4	The present experiments were designed to explore the in vitro effects of IST-FS 29 on four human glioblastoma cell lines : A-172 , DBTRG.05MG , U-87MG and CAS-1 .	
12635657_s5	The average IC50 values were obtained by MTT assay and ranged between 3 and 10 microM .	
12635657_s6	Time-course assays with cell recovery after drug withdrawal , demonstrated marked cytotoxicity following exposure to IST-FS 29 for 8 , 24 and 72 h .	
12635657_s7	Cultures treated for 8 h were able to partially re-grow by 144 h ; on the contrary , longer times of exposure did not allow surviving cells to recover from the damage and actively proliferate .	
12635657_s8	Cell morphology of cultures exposed to IST-FS 29 was assessed by inverted light microscopy after 24 and 72 h and was more consistent with cell death by necrosis which included cell size reduction , vacuolation of cytoplasm , round dying cells .	resisting cell death
12635657_s9	The present results and our previous data , in vitro and in vivo , indicate the relevant cytotoxic activity of this organo-tin compound and suggest that IST-FS 29 might be a promising novel agent to be developed for the treatment of malignant brain neoplasms .	
12647634_s0	BACKGROUND Angiogenesis is of crucial importance for tumor growth and development of metastases .	
12647634_s1	Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) has a potent angiogenic activity and mutations of the p53 gene has been thought to upregulate VEGF .	
12647634_s2	The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of these tumor biomarkers for angiogenesis relative to the information derived from established clinicopathological parameters in gastric cancer .	
12647634_s3	METHODS In this study , we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation of VEGF and p53 expression in 145 tissue samples obtained from gastric cancer patients undergoing curative surgical treatment .	
12647634_s4	To evaluate angiogenesis , microvessel density ( MVD ) was counted by staining endothelial cells immunohistochemically using anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody .	
12647634_s5	RESULTS High MVD was significantly associated with depth of tumor invasion and distant metastasis ( p = 0.004 , 0.021 , respectively ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
12647634_s6	Moreover , overall survival for patients with high MVD were significantly lower than that of low MVD ( p = 0.048 ) .	
12647634_s7	Positive expression of VEGF correlated significantly with lymph node and distant metastasis ( p = 0.040 , 0.048 , respectively ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
12647634_s8	However , no significant correlation was found between p53 expression and various clinicopathological parameters .	
12647634_s9	VEGF positive tumors showed a higher MVD than VEGF negative tumors ( p = 0.028 ) .	inducing angiogenesis
12647634_s10	The expression of p53 did not correlate with VEGF expression .	inducing angiogenesis
12647634_s11	Also , the relationship between the status of p53 expression and MVD had not statistically significant differences .	
12647634_s12	In the multivariate analysis , status of VEGF , p53 expression and MVD were not an independent prognostic factor .	
12647634_s13	CONCLUSION VEGF seems to be an important , clinically relevant inducer of angiogenesis and angiogenesis assessed by the MVD may be a useful marker for predicting metastasis in gastric cancer .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
12647634_s14	However , further studies are warranted to clarify the impact of p53 on the angiogenesis and the prognostic significance of angiogenesis in gastric cancer .	inducing angiogenesis
12697993_s0	Cell lines of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( T-ALL ) have gained high interest for study of mechanisms of cytostatic drug resistance .	
12697993_s1	However , they should also be suited to examine the validity and reliability of molecular cytogenetic techniques in detecting genomic alterations in neoplastic cells .	
12697993_s2	Therefore , comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) and 24-color-fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization ( M-FISH ) were applied to eight sublines of CCRF-CEM leukemia cells selected in vitro for drug resistance and to their drug-sensitive parental counterparts .	
12697993_s3	All cell lines were characterized by altered chromosome numbers and by a variety of chromosomal structural aberrations as shown by M-FISH .	
12697993_s4	The great majority of anomalies detected by this technique were confirmed by CGH .	
12697993_s5	Interestingly , a considerable number of the rearrangements found were imbalanced .	
12697993_s6	Amplifications of 5q13 in the six methotrexate-resistant cell lines , a del(9)(p21pter) in all lines examined , and a gain of chromosome 20 in 9 of the 10 lines examined were readily detected by both techniques .	genomic instability and mutation
12697993_s7	The same held true for losses of chromosomes 17 and 18 in the near tetraploid cell lines which could also be confirmed by CGH .	genomic instability and mutation
12697993_s8	Some imbalances of genomic material detected by CGH were , however , not observed by means of M-FISH , possibly due to the limited extension of the corresponding chromosomal segment involved or the small subpopulation of cells affected .	genomic instability and mutation
12697993_s9	On the other hand , reciprocal translocations , balanced isochromosomes , and small deletions remained mainly undetected by CGH .	genomic instability and mutation
12697993_s10	A comparison of chromosomal alterations in drug-resistant and parental cell lines showed not only amplifications of chromosomal segments harboring well-known drug resistance genes , e.g. , the dihydrofolate reductase gene , but also chromosomal changes which may involve novel genes associated with drug resistance .	genomic instability and mutation
12697993_s11	Thus , the present study has clearly unveiled the strengths and weaknesses of both techniques which can excellently complement each other .	
12697993_s12	Their combination allowed a distinct improvement of the definition of the complex karyotypes of drug-resistant cell lines .	
12815293_s0	This article describes evaluation of plasma membrane fluidity and intracellular SOD with relation to apoptotic death of cervical carcinoma cells after radiation therapy .	
12815293_s1	Cells from biopsies of cancer patients ( stage IIIB ) prior to and 24 h after radiation dose of 2 Gy were examined .	
12815293_s2	Plasma membrane fluidity , measured by fluorescence polarization of DPH incorporated into lipid bilayer and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity , determined by epinephrine method , showed significant decrease but per cent apoptotic cells , as determined by annexin-V and TUNEL methods , were found increased by two folds after radiotherapy .	resisting cell death
12815293_s3	It is suggested that decrease in DPH polarization in membrane , reduction in SOD activity and increased apoptosis in cervical cells of cancer patients treated with radiation may be consequent to oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which may have implications in developing predictive protocol in cancer radiotherapy .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
1281999_s0	Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , also known as vascular permeability factor or vasculotropin , is a recently characterized endothelial-specific mitogen which is angiogenic in vivo .	
1281999_s1	Here we demonstrate that VEGF is angiogenic in vitro : when added to microvascular endothelial cells grown on the surface of three-dimensional collagen gels , VEGF induces the cells to invade the underlying matrix and to form capillary-like tubules , with an optimal effect at approximately 2.2nM ( 100ng/ml ) .	inducing angiogenesis
1281999_s2	When compared to basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) at equimolar ( 0.5nM ) concentrations , VEGF was about half as potent .	inducing angiogenesis
1281999_s3	The most striking effect was seen in combination with bFGF : when added simultaneously , VEGF and bFGF induced an in vitro angiogenic response which was far greater than additive , and which occurred with greater rapidity than the response to either cytokine alone .	inducing angiogenesis
1281999_s4	These results demonstrate that like bFGF , VEGF induces an angiogenic response via a direct effect on endothelial cells , and that by acting in concert , these two cytokines have a potent synergistic effect on the induction of angiogenesis in vitro .	inducing angiogenesis
1281999_s5	We suggest that the synergism between VEGF and bFGF plays an important role in the control of angiogenesis in vivo .	inducing angiogenesis
12850814_s0	There is little understanding of the factors controlling the mobilization of blast cells from bone marrow to peripheral blood and tissues .	
12850814_s1	The aim of this study was to evaluate the soluble hepatocyte growth factor ( sHGF ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( sVEGF ) levels in newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) and to correlate these levels with the clinico-pathological features .	
12850814_s2	Sixty-three patients with AML and 15 normal controls were included in this study .	
12850814_s3	The levels of sHGF and sVEGF were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay at diagnosis and after remission induction chemotherapy .	
12850814_s4	Our results revealed significantly increased plasma levels of sHGF and sVEGF at diagnosis when compared to both control and remission levels ( P=0.000 for both ) .	inducing angiogenesis
12850814_s5	The sHGF and sVEGF levels differed between AML FAB subtypes ( P=0.000 ) .	
12850814_s6	The highest concentrations were found in M5 followed by M4 .	
12850814_s7	SHGF and sVEGF were directly correlated with peripheral white cell counts ( WBC ) ( r=0.836 , P=0.000 , r=0.718 ; P=0.000 , respectively ) , but inversely correlated with blast cell distribution ratio ( BCDR ) ( r=-0.785 , P=0.000 , r=-0.664 , P=0.000 , respectively ) .	
12850814_s8	Moreover , both sHGF and sVEGF levels were significantly elevated in AML patients with extra-medullary infiltration as compared to those without ( P=0.000 , 0.006 , respectively ) .	
12850814_s9	The sHGF but not sVEGF levels were significantly elevated in patients who died compared to those who relapsed and to patients in complete remission ( P=0.02 , 0.08 , respectively ) .	
12850814_s10	Logistic regression analysis revealed that the sHGF level at diagnoses is a powerful predictor of the patient outcome , compared to sVEGF .	
12850814_s11	In conclusion : our data support the hypothesis that angiogenic factors play a functional role in blast cell movement from the bone marrow to peripheral tissues .	inducing angiogenesis
12850814_s12	Assessment of sHGF at AML diagnosis is likely to be helpful in predicting patient outcome and selecting optimal therapeutic regimen .	
1288288_s0	We have investigated the cellular requirements for IL-2 production by autocrine proliferating tumor cells from four patients with adult T cell leukemia ( ATL ) .	
1288288_s1	Cultures of these ATL cells both produced endogenous IL-2 protein in the absence of added mitogen and proliferated at higher levels when exogenous recombinant IL-2 was added .	
1288288_s2	Depletion of macrophages in the tumor cell cultures resulted in a sharp decline in tumor cell IL-2 production , while re-addition of macrophages reconstituted this response .	
1288288_s3	Macrophage-derived factors including IL-6 and IL-1 also reconstituted IL-2 production in these macrophage depleted cultures .	
1288288_s4	These results raise the possibility that macrophages may play a central role in HTLV-I mediated immortalization of T cells .	enabling replicative immortality
1295379_s0	FCE 23762 ( 3 ' desamino-3'[2(s)methoxyl-4-morpholinyl]doxorubicin ) is a new doxorubicin ( Dx ) derivative that has been selected for clinical testing for its favourable antitumor characteristics , which include efficacy on Dx-resistant tumors .	
1295379_s1	Immunosuppression is an undesirable side-effect of anti-cancer chemotherapy and the therapeutic efficacy of Dx is probably also related to its low immunotoxicity .	
1295379_s2	It was , thus , of interest to compare the effects of FCE 23762 and its parental drug on the immune responses .	
1295379_s3	Both compounds were injected i.v. into healthy mice at equitoxic doses and according to different treatment schedules .	
1295379_s4	Single doses of FCE 23762 and Dx , given concomitant or after the antigen , suppressed at the same degree and dose-dependently the primary anti-SRBC antibody response .	
1295379_s5	Following a multiple treatment schedule after the antigen , FCE 23762 was less suppressive than Dx on both primary and secondary antibody production .	
1295379_s6	Differently from Dx , that was completely inactive , FCE 23762 moderately inhibited DTH reaction to SRBC , only at the highest single dose tested or for repeated administrations given simultaneously or after priming .	
1295379_s7	Both drugs were totally ineffective in delaying skin allograft rejection .	
1295379_s8	Since spleen cellularity and ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation to Con A and LPS were similarly impaired by the two drugs , the differentiated immunodepressive activity of FCE 23762 and Dx cannot be merely associated to their cytotoxic and antiproliferative action .	avoiding immune destruction
1295379_s9	The hypothesis of a selective effect on different regulatory cell subsets and/or immune mechanisms is discussed .	avoiding immune destruction
1312308_s0	Activated lymphocytes and malignant lymphoma cells derived from them ( Ki-1 positive lymphoma cells ) share similar mechanisms of proliferation .	
1312308_s1	To further examine the inhibitory role of endogenous transforming growth factor beta ( TGF beta ) in Ki-1 positive lymphoma cells , the authors studied anti-TGF beta antibodies and measured their effect on proliferation .	
1312308_s2	A monoclonal antibody ( T1A5 ) prepared against a unique antigenic epitope of high molecular weight Hodgkin's TGF beta and a polyclonal rabbit antibody prepared against highly purified 25,000 D porcine platelet TGF beta 1 were used .	
1312308_s3	Both antibodies are shown here to inhibit the biological activity of Hodgkin's TGF beta and to crossreact with their respective antigens in immunoblotting .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1312308_s4	DNA synthesis by Ki-1 lymphoma cells was increased 138-fold by anti-TGF beta 1 antibody and 262-fold by anti-Hodgkin's TGF beta .	
1312308_s5	Exogenous TGF beta 1 suppression was completely reversed by anti-TGF beta 1 antibody and IL-2-induced proliferation was markedly potentiated ( 41 fold ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1312308_s6	L-428 Reed-Sternberg cells secrete physiologically active TGF beta but have fewer than 500 TGF beta receptor sites per cell ; no significant proliferative response was measured for either anti-TGF beta 1 or anti-Hodgkin's TGF beta .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1312308_s7	These results show the suppressive effect of exogenous TGF beta 1 on indolent Ki-1 lymphoma cells and suggest that the endogenous secretion of high molecular weight physiologically active TGF beta is important in maintaining the indolent nature of this low-grade Ki-1 positive lymphoma .	
1315291_s0	5-HT1c receptors have been shown to act as protooncogenes in NIH 3T3 cells , inducing ligand-dependent focus formation .	
1315291_s1	In order to assess their mitogenic and oncogenic potential in a different cell system , we transfected these receptors into CCL39 hamster fibroblasts , a well-characterized growth factor-dependent cell line .	
1315291_s2	Cell clones expressing functional receptors were isolated and tested for ( a ) growth factor dependence of proliferation measuring thymidine incorporation in response to varying doses of serum , ( b ) the response to serotonin alone or in combination with other growth factors , and ( c ) the capacity for anchorage-independent proliferation .	
1315291_s3	In the absence or presence of serotonin , the large majority of the clones isolated showed normal morphology and normal growth factor dependence and was unable to grow in soft agar .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1315291_s4	None of the clones showed a significant response to serotonin alone in DNA synthesis reinitiation experiments , but synergy was observed between serotonin and the tyrosine kinase activating growth factors EGF and FGF .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1315291_s5	However , the major part of this effect could be abolished by an antagonist of 5-HT1b receptors , which are endogenous in CCL39 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1315291_s6	The same receptor was found to mediate a significant mitogenic response to the neurotransmitter in Ha-ras-transfected cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1315291_s7	The fact that 5-HT1c receptors do not readily induce a transformed phenotype in CCL39 cells clearly distinguishes them from strong dominantly acting oncogene products like RAS , SRC , or FMS .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1355514_s0	Three normal human diploid cell strains were transfected with an activated Ha-ras oncogene ( EJ ras ) or SV40 T-antigen .	
1355514_s1	Multiple clones were examined for morphological alterations , growth requirements , ability to grow under anchorage independent conditions , immortality and tumorigenicity in nude mice .	
1355514_s2	Clones expressing SV40 T-antigen alone or in combination with ras protein p21 were significantly radioresistant as compared with their parent cells or clones transfected with the neo gene only .	
1355514_s3	This radioresistant phenotype persisted in post-crisis , immortalized cell lines .	enabling replicative immortality
1355514_s4	Cells transfected with EJ ras alone showed no morphological alterations nor significant changes in radiosensitivity .	
1355514_s5	Cell clones expressing ras and/or SV40 T-antigen showed a reduced requirement for serum supplements , an increase in aneuploidy and chromosomal aberrations , and enhanced growth in soft agar as an early cellular response to SV40 T-antigen expression .	genomic instability and mutation
1355514_s6	The sequential order of transfection with SV40 T-antigen and ras influenced radio-sensitivity but not the induction of morphological changes .	
1355514_s7	These data suggest that expression of the SV40 T-antigen but not activated Ha-ras plays an important role in the radiosensitivity of human diploid cells .	
1355514_s8	The radioresistant phenotype in SV40 T transfected cells was not related to the enhanced level of genetic instability seen in pre-crisis and newly immortalized cells , nor to the process of immortalization itself .	enabling replicative immortality
1394204_s0	Since tumor cells are more dependent on glycolysis for energy supply than other cells , we tested whether its inhibition by 2-deoxy-D-glucose ( 2-DG ) affects tumor growth .	
1394204_s1	Male Wistar rats were inoculated in the liver with tumor cells from a chemically induced colonic adenocarcinoma .	
1394204_s2	From day 5 after inoculation 2-DG ( 400 mg/kg/24 h ) was continuously infused into the hepatic artery for 5 days ; controls received saline in the same fashion .	
1394204_s3	Seven days after the end of infusion , the animals were sacrificed .	
1394204_s4	A second experimental group of rats was treated with isolated liver perfusion for 30 min with oxygenated blood through the portal vein and hepatic artery simultaneously .	
1394204_s5	In the perfusate , 400 mg/kg 2-DG were added , and the rats were sacrificed at 10 days after perfusion .	
1394204_s6	A first control group underwent perfusion without 2-DG , and a second control group received i.v. infusion of 2-DG ( 400 mg/kg/30 min ) for 30 min over 5 days .	
1394204_s7	A nontreated control group was also added .	
1394204_s8	All animals survived the procedures .	
1394204_s9	The concentration of blood glucose increased in the rats receiving 2-DG i.v. and intraarterially but was unchanged in the other groups .	cellular energetics
1394204_s10	The tumor growth was significantly reduced by 2-DG in all experimental groups , with no difference between the groups .	
1394204_s11	It is therefore concluded that 2-DG is of potential interest in the treatment of malignancies .	
1394204_s12	Since local application of 2-DG avoids the risk for systemic side effects , this approach should be explored further .	
1403541_s0	This study aims to identify significant predictors of survival in pediatric and adolescent colorectal carcinoma .	
1403541_s1	We retrospectively analyzed our experience with 29 histologically verified cases , of which 20 were resected for cure .	
1403541_s2	Variables analyzed as predictors of survival included : ( 1 ) resectability , ( 2 ) regional nodal involvement , ( 3 ) depth of invasion , ( 4 ) grade , and ( 5 ) interval from symptom onset to diagnosis .	
1403541_s3	Signet ring or anaplastic lesions were considered high grade .	
1403541_s4	Survival curves were generated on both the overall group and those resected for cure .	
1403541_s5	Multivariate analysis was performed on the overall group .	
1403541_s6	The median age at diagnosis was 19 years ( range , 10 to 21 ) .	
1403541_s7	Median follow-up in survivors was 4.7 years .	
1403541_s8	Signet ring tumors occurred in 45% and another 24% were poorly differentiated .	
1403541_s9	Seventy-six percent presented with regional lymph node metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
1403541_s10	The median survival for the overall group was 16 months , whereas that for those undergoing complete resection was 33 months .	
1403541_s11	In patients undergoing resection for cure , grade ( P = .005 ) , regional nodal involvement ( P = .007 ) , and depth of invasion ( P = .03 ) were significant predictors of outcome in univariate analysis .	activating invasion and metastasis
1403541_s12	In the overall group these variables as well as resectability and distant metastases were significant in univariate analysis .	
1403541_s13	In multivariate analysis high-grade lesions and lymph node involvement were highly correlated , as were resectability and metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
1403541_s14	Thus , either variable ( but not both ) of each pair added information to the multivariate model .	
1403541_s15	In patients resected for cure , positive nodes or high histological grade became the only significant predictors of survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )	
1408144_s0	The ras oncogenes alone fully transform established ( immortalized ) rodent fibroblasts in a few days , but generally transform early-passage fibroblasts only partially , unless their action is complemented by that of a nuclear , immortalizing , oncogene .	
1408144_s1	Here we show that transfection of second-passage Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts ( HEFs ) by the EJ-H-ras oncogene coupled to the neo gene , followed by selection with G418 , gives rise to apparently normal , or only slightly transformed , clonal colonies , only a few of which become established .	
1408144_s2	The study of two established clonal lines showed that they acquired only after some weeks , and stepwise , the main characteristics of full neoplastic transformation , i.e. anchorage independence , reduced requirement for serum growth factors and tumorigenicity .	
1408144_s3	Later both clonal lines became increasingly tumorigenic and completely independent of exogenous growth and attachment factors , without increase in the expression of the H-ras oncogene .	
1408144_s4	Transfection of one of the clones , early after its isolation , with a truncated derivative of the nuclear v-myb oncogene devoid of its transcriptional negative regulatory domain and able to partially transform chicken embryo fibroblasts [ (myb(KXANM) ] gave rise to more transformed cells , expressing both EJ-H-ras and myb(KXANM) , which became tumorigenic earlier than the controls and remained more tumorigenic later on .	
1408144_s5	With more efficient transfection techniques , numerous foci of fully transformed cells were subsequently obtained , in a few days , in cultures transfected sequentially with EJ-H-ras(neo) and myb(KXANM) and in cultures co-transfected with the two oncogenes .	
1408144_s6	Highly tumorigenic , serum-independent and immortalized clones expressing both oncogenes were obtained from these cultures .	enabling replicative immortality
1408144_s7	Hence , the truncated myb(KXANM) oncogene accelerate the stepwise transformation of unestablished HEFs by the EJ-HH-ras oncogene and , together with this oncogene , fully transforms these same cells in a single step .	
1408144_s8	The two oncogenes acting in cooperation also induce cell immortalization , but myb(KXANM) , by itself , is not an immortalizing oncogene .	enabling replicative immortality
1408144_s9	No cooperation was observed between EJ-H-ras(neo) and the unaltered v-myb oncogene .	
1433375_s0	Immunosuppression of humoral and cellular responses following chronic oral exposure to 1 , 5 , 10 , and 20 ppm N-nitrosodimethylamine ( NDMA ) was examined in CD-1 mice .	
1433375_s1	Monitoring of cumulative mortality and the incidence of peritoneal ascites in animals showed an NDMA dose-related mortality and hepatotoxicity .	
1433375_s2	No visible changes in immunological parameters were noted at the 1 ppm NDMA dose .	
1433375_s3	Immunosuppression of immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) antibody response by NDMA to sheep red blood cells ( SRBC ) was time-related , dose-related , and could be reversed within 30 d by removal of the chemical from the drinking water .	avoiding immune destruction
1433375_s4	Cellular immune response , monitored by allogeneic stimulation of cells in mixed lymphocyte reaction ( MLR ) , was markedly suppressed by 10 and 20 ppm NDMA .	avoiding immune destruction
1433375_s5	Thus , chronic exposure to NDMA , except for the low-hepatotoxic doses of nitrosamine , resulted in a marked and persistent immunosuppression of cellular and humoral responses in CD-1 mice .	avoiding immune destruction
1433375_s6	In conclusion , chronic exposure to the hepatotoxic ( ascite-inducing ) doses of NDMA suppressed humoral and cellular immunity .	avoiding immune destruction
1433375_s7	The persistent immunosuppression could be reversed after the removal of NDMA from the drinking water .	avoiding immune destruction
1433375_s8	Although no direct NDMA-related cancer was reported in humans , our data point to a potential epigenetic carcinogenicity of nitrosamines due to chronic immunosuppression .	avoiding immune destruction
1434651_s0	Between 1965 and 1985 , 489 patients with advanced gastric cancer who were treated with gastric resection and in whom tumor cells remained after the operation were defined as cases of a " noncurative resection. "	
1434651_s1	The clinicopathological features and prognosis of these patients were examined and two groups were prepared : locally advanced cancer and cancer with a distant metastasis .	
1434651_s2	In locally advanced cancer cases , tumor cells remained in the neighboring organs , lymph nodes , and/or resected margins ; in those with distant metastasis , peritoneal dissemination and/or liver metastasis were present regardless of whether or not the metastasis was removed , with or without locally noncurative factors .	activating invasion and metastasis
1434651_s3	Serosal invasion was prominent and high rates of lymph node metastasis and lymphatic involvement were evident in both groups .	activating invasion and metastasis
1434651_s4	The survival rate for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer was better than that of patients with distant metastasis ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
1434651_s5	Survival time in patients with locally advanced cancer can be lengthened by resecting all of the primary tumor and as much of the metastatic lesions as possible , even if the surgical management is " noncurative. "	activating invasion and metastasis
1434651_s6	Aggressive postoperative chemotherapy for patients with distant metastasis from a gastric cancer is to be recommended .	activating invasion and metastasis
1457353_s0	The purpose of this study was to generate a selective radiosensitising effect by the intra-hepatic-arterial infusion of misonidazole ( MISO ) .	
1457353_s1	MISO ( 10 mg ) was infused after transcatheter hepatic-arterial embolisation into the livers of rabbits bearing VX2 liver cancer .	
1457353_s2	This procedure was followed by 15 Gy electron irradiation .	
1457353_s3	Evaluation of tumour volume and histological examination was carried out on the 7th day after treatment .	
1457353_s4	The greatest tumour response was obtained in the group which received MISO followed by radiation and was characterised by extensive fibrosis around the tumour and nearly complete tumour necrosis .	resisting cell death
1457353_s5	Liver cell regeneration was also noted in adjacent liver tissue .	
1457353_s6	The advantages of regional infusion of MISO following hepatic-arterial embolisation are : ( 1 ) Selectivity increased radiosensitivity of liver cancer alongside very low drug concentration in the plasma .	
1457353_s7	( 2 ) Reduced or absent deleterious side effects of MISO with higher tumour/normal tissue ratios of drug concentration .	
1457353_s8	( 3 ) Reduced cost due to the lower dosage of MISO required for regional infusion .	
1463095_s0	Thirty-five cases of clear cell sarcoma of soft tissues were studied to determine the clinical or morphologic features that are important in predicting prognosis .	
1463095_s1	Tumors occurred most commonly in the extremities , and the majority of the patients were young women .	
1463095_s2	Surgery was the elected treatment in every case .	
1463095_s3	Five patients experienced local recurrences , and metastases developed in 22 .	
1463095_s4	Fifty-four percent of the patients died of tumor , 11% are alive with disease , and the remaining 34% are alive and well ; the average survival for each group was 67 months , 113 months , and 103.5 months , respectively .	
1463095_s5	This sarcoma is characterized by small clusters of polygonal to spindle cells featuring clear to slightly basophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli .	
1463095_s6	The clusters are separated by delicate fibrous septa .	
1463095_s7	In a deletion , clear cell sarcoma has low mitotic activity , little or no necrosis , and mild nuclear pleomorphism .	resisting cell death
1463095_s8	Tumor size and the presence of necrosis are statistically significant predictors of prognosis .	resisting cell death
1463095_s9	All 12 patients with tumors measuring &gt ; 5 cm died of disease or are alive with disease .	
1463095_s10	Eleven of the 20 patients with tumors measuring &lt ; 5 cm are alive with no evidence of disease .	
1463095_s11	Tumor necrosis was present in 10 cases ; eight of these patients died of disease and one is alive with disseminated metastases .	activating invasion and metastasis
1464591_s0	The high affinity fibronectin receptor ( FNR ) is expressed by hematopoietic cells , fibroblasts , and proliferating epidermal cells .	
1464591_s1	Expression of this integrin is altered by chemical and viral transformation , suggesting that FNR dysfunction may play a role in growth control .	
1464591_s2	This study demonstrates that exposing FA-K562 cells to glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine ( GRGDS ) , a peptide ligand of the FNR , specifically stimulates p34/cdc2- and cyclin A-associated kinase activities .	
1464591_s3	This occurs within 2 h of peptide addition .	
1464591_s4	The 110-kDa form of the retinoblastoma protein appears within 3 h of GRGDS addition , consistent with activation of a G1/S kinase .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1464591_s5	DNA staining profiles demonstrate that GRGDS induces cell cycle progression within 24 h .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1464591_s6	Increased anchorage-independent growth is subsequently observed in GRGDS-treated FA-K562 cells .	
1464591_s7	The control peptide , GRGES , which cannot bind the FNR , has none of these effects .	
1464591_s8	This demonstrates that an extracellular integrin ligand can regulate cell proliferation .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1464591_s9	Furthermore , these results suggest that integrins link the extracellular environment and intracellular growth regulators .	
1469065_s0	Transforming growth factor-Beta ( TGF-beta ) is a potent growth inhibitor for several cell types including epithelial cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells .	
1469065_s1	Using a human promonocytic leukemia cell line , THP-1 , we have shown that TGF-beta inhibits their proliferation and promotes differentiation into cells exhibiting macrophage-like properties .	
1469065_s2	Therefore , a key question is whether TGF-beta influences the expression of genes associated with proliferation and/or growth inhibition .	
1469065_s3	TGF-beta treatment of THP-1 cells results in downregulation of expression of c-myc .	
1469065_s4	We also observe that TGF-beta 1-treated cells express reduced levels of the cell cycle regulated histone , H2B , but express elevated levels of an RNA splicing variant of this histone that has been observed to be upregulated in growth inhibited and terminally differentiated cells .	
1469065_s5	In addition , a nuclear protein associated with senescence and withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle , statin , is also expressed by THP-1 cells in response to TGF-beta 1 treatment .	enabling replicative immortality,sustaining proliferative signaling
1469065_s6	These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 is capable of inducing expression of specific nuclear proteins associated with differentiation and/or cessation of proliferation that may result in changes in nuclear organization and altered gene expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1469065_s7	Such changes in nuclear organization may be incompatible with continued proliferation of the cells .	
1483262_s0	Using an immunoradiometric assay , Cathepsin D ( Cath D ) levels were measured in the cytosol of 23 normal and 39 neoplastic human laryngeal tissues .	
1483262_s1	Scattered Cath D levels ( from 2.2 to 17.8 pM/mg protein ; median = 7.6 ) were found in normal mucosa specimens .	
1483262_s2	Cath D concentrations range from 2.0 to 29.3 pM/mg protein ( median = 8.5 ) in laryngeal tumors .	
1483262_s3	When a comparison between Cath D levels in normal and neoplastic tissue specimens from the same patient was done , Cath D levels were significantly higher in laryngeal cancers than in their normal counterparts ( P = 0.03 ) .	
1483262_s4	No correlation with clinico-pathological parameters and steroid hormone and epidermal growth factor receptor status was found .	sustaining proliferative signaling
1483262_s5	Further studies should investigate whether the production of Cath D by laryngeal tumors could have a clinical relevance for this neoplasia .	
1524003_s0	We analyzed the clinico-pathological features of the initial tumors in 205 patients with superficial bladder cancer , admitted to Kyoto University Hospital between 1974 and 1988 , to investigate the prognostic factors for progression to the muscle invasive disease or metastasis .	
1524003_s1	Of 205 patients , 35 ( 17% ) exhibited muscular invasion alone ( 12 patients ) and/or metastasis ( 23 patients ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
1524003_s2	Tumor multiplicity , higher grade and positive urinary cytology were the significant risk factors for later malignant progression .	
1524003_s3	Expression of A , B , H-blood group isoantigens in the bladder tumor were significantly decreased from the onset in the patients with initially T1 tumor but not in those with Ta tumor .	
1524003_s4	Significant loss of expression was also found at the time of progression in the initially Ta cases .	
1524003_s5	Thus , loss of A , B , H-blood group antigen expression seems to be correlated with the malignant potential of superficial bladder cancer .	
1524003_s6	However , more feasible and reliable diagnostic markers such as molecular genetical and biochemical markers remain to be developed to predict the malignant potential of the superficial bladder cancer .	
1639539_s0	The effects of human interferon ( IFN)-alpha , -beta , and -gamma on the immortalization of human and rabbit lymphocytes by human T-lymphotropic virus type-I ( HTLV-I ) have been investigated .	
1639539_s1	The immortalization of human peripheral-blood lymphocytes co-cultured with lethally X-ray-irradiated HTLV-I-producer cells , MT-2 , was blocked in the presence of more than 40 u/ml human recombinant IFN-alpha or more than 200 u/ml human natural type IFN-beta .	enabling replicative immortality
1639539_s2	However , rhIFN-gamma did not block immortalization by HTLV-I even at higher doses .	
1639539_s3	On the other hand , the presence of high doses of hIFN-alpha , -beta , or -gamma did not exhibit any biological effect on the immortalization of rabbit peripheral-blood lymphocytes co-cultured with lethally X-ray-irradiated MT-2 cells .	enabling replicative immortality
1639539_s4	Integration of the full length of HTLV-I genome was detected in every transformant by Southern blot analysis .	
1639539_s5	All cell lines established were CD4+/CD8 divided by T-lymphocytes , except for one cell line of CD4+/CD8+ .	avoiding immune destruction
1639539_s6	Morphologically intact HTLV-I production was observed by electron microscopy in these cells .	
1639539_s7	Our results indicate that HTLV-I released under the strongly suppressed condition in the presence of IFNs remains active and able to immortalize T lymphocytes .	enabling replicative immortality
1639539_s8	It is also suggested that immortalization of human T lymphocytes by HTLV-I can be inhibited by the antiviral state induced by the treatment with low doses of hIFN-alpha and -beta , whereas immortalization of rabbit T lymphocytes is not inhibited because of the species specificity of hIFNs .	enabling replicative immortality
19556603_s0	Hexavalent chromium ( Cr(VI) ) compounds are known human carcinogens associated with the incidence of lung cancer .	
19556603_s1	Although a direct correlation between Cr(VI) exposure and lung cancer has been established , several studies aimed at generating animal models for Cr(VI) have yielded inconsistent data that do not affirmatively support findings from epidemiologic studies .	
19556603_s2	Because the lack of a good animal model has hindered the identification of molecular mechanisms involved in Cr(VI) exposure , we developed an in vitro model that facilitates mechanistic studies of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis .	
19556603_s3	We report here that long-term exposure to Cr(VI) leads to the malignant transformation of nontumorigenic human lung epithelial cells .	
19556603_s4	Cr(VI)-transformed cells exhibited loss of contact inhibition , colony formation , and increased rates of cell invasion , migration , and proliferation , as compared with passage-matched control cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,evading growth suppressors
19556603_s5	Cr(VI)-transformed cells evaded apoptosis by a mechanism involving S-nitrosylation and stabilization of Bcl-2 protein in a nitric oxide-dependent manner .	resisting cell death
19556603_s6	This study establishes an important in vitro model that facilitates mechanistic studies of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis , and elucidates a novel mechanism that causes apoptosis-resistant malignant transformation of nontumorigenic lung cells in response to a human carcinogen .	
19966861_s0	Most cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis for generation of their energy supply .	
19966861_s1	This specificity could be used to preferentially kill these cells .	
19966861_s2	In this study , we identified the signaling pathway initiated by glycolysis inhibition that results in sensitization to death receptor ( DR)-induced apoptosis .	cellular energetics,resisting cell death
19966861_s3	We showed , in several human cancer cell lines ( such as Jurkat , HeLa , U937 ) , that glucose removal or the use of nonmetabolizable form of glucose ( 2-deoxyglucose ) dramatically enhances apoptosis induced by Fas or by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand .	
19966861_s4	This sensitization is controlled through the adenosine monophosphate ( AMP)-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , which is the central energy-sensing system of the cell .	
19966861_s5	We established the fact that AMPK is activated upon glycolysis block resulting in mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibition leading to Mcl-1 decrease , but no other Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic members .	cellular energetics
19966861_s6	Interestingly , we determined that , upon glycolysis inhibition , the AMPK-mTOR pathway controlled Mcl-1 levels neither through transcriptional nor through posttranslational mechanism but rather by controlling its translation .	
19966861_s7	Therefore , our results show a novel mechanism for the sensitization to DR-induced apoptosis linking glucose metabolism to Mcl-1 downexpression .	cellular energetics,resisting cell death
19966861_s8	In addition , this study provides a rationale for the combined use of DR ligands with AMPK activators or mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of human cancers .	
20056578_s0	BACKGROUND Inorganic arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental carcinogen affecting millions of people worldwide .	
20056578_s1	Evolving theory predicts that normal stem cells ( NSCs ) are transformed into cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) that then drive oncogenesis .	
20056578_s2	In humans , arsenic is carcinogenic in the urogenital system ( UGS ) , including the bladder and potentially the prostate , whereas in mice arsenic induces multi-organ UGS cancers , indicating that UGS NSCs may represent targets for carcino-genic initiation .	
20056578_s3	However , proof of emergence of CSCs induced by arsenic in a stem cell population is not available .	
20056578_s4	METHODS We continuously exposed the human prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cell line WPE-stem to an environmentally relevant level of arsenic ( 5 microM ) in vitro and determined the acquired cancer phenotype .	
20056578_s5	RESULTS WPE-stem cells rapidly acquired a malignant CSC-like phenotype by 18 weeks of exposure , becoming highly invasive , losing contact inhibition , and hyper-secreting matrix metalloproteinase-9 .	activating invasion and metastasis,evading growth suppressors
20056578_s6	When hetero-transplanted , these cells ( designated As-CSC ) formed highly pleomorphic , aggressive tumors with immature epithelial- and mesenchymal-like cells , suggesting a highly pluripotent cell of origin .	
20056578_s7	Consistent with tumor-derived CSCs , As-CSCs formed abundant free-floating spheres enriched in CSC-like cells , as confirmed by molecular analysis and the fact that only these floating cells formed xeno-graft tumors .	
20056578_s8	An early loss of NSC self-renewal gene expression ( p63 , ABCG2 , BMI-1 , SHH , OCT-4 , NOTCH-1 ) during arsenite exposure was sub-sequently reversed as the tumor suppressor gene PTEN was progressively suppressed and the CSC-like phenotype acquired .	
20056578_s9	CONCLUSIONS Arsenite transforms prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells into CSC-like cells , indicating that it can produce CSCs from a model NSC population .	
20106725_s0	In eukaryotic cells , multiple DNA repair mechanisms respond to a wide variety of DNA lesions .	
20106725_s1	Homologous recombination-dependent repair provides a pathway for dealing with DNA double-strand breaks and replication fork demise .	
20106725_s2	A key step in this process is the resolution of recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions ( HJs ) .	
20106725_s3	Recently , nucleases from yeast ( Yen1 ) and human cells ( GEN1 ) were identified that can resolve HJ intermediates , in a manner analogous to the E. coli HJ resolvase RuvC .	
20106725_s4	Here , we have analyzed the role of Yen1 in DNA repair in S. cerevisiae , and show that while yen1Delta mutants are repair-proficient , yen1Delta mus81Delta double mutants are exquisitely sensitive to a variety of DNA-damaging agents that disturb replication fork progression .	genomic instability and mutation
20106725_s5	This phenotype is dependent upon RAD52 , indicating that toxic recombination intermediates accumulate in the absence of Yen1 and Mus81 .	
20106725_s6	After MMS treatment , yen1Delta mus81Delta double mutants arrest with a G2 DNA content and unsegregated chromosomes .	
20106725_s7	These findings indicate that Yen1 can act upon recombination/repair intermediates that arise in MUS81-defective cells following replication fork damage .	
20113375_s0	Mucoepidermoid carcinoma ( MEC ) , the most common primary salivary malignancy , shows great variability in clinical behaviour , thus demanding investigation to identify of prognostic markers .	
20113375_s1	Since Warburg's studies , unrestricted cell growth during tumorigenesis has been linked to altered metabolism , implying hypoxic stimulation of glycolysis and diminished contribution of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to cellular ATP supply .	
20113375_s2	Hypothesizing that the study of MEC metabolic status could lead to the discovery of prognostic markers , we investigated by immunohistochemistry the expression of glucose transporter 1 ( Glut-1 ) , mitochondrial antigen and peroxiredoxin I ( Prx I ) in samples of MEC from different histological grades .	
20113375_s3	Our results showed that mitochondrial antigen and Prx I were expressed in the majority of the MEC cases independent of the histological grade .	
20113375_s4	In contrast Glut-1 expression increased significantly as the tumours became more aggressive .	
20113375_s5	These results suggested that oxidative phosphorylation may contribute to ATP supply in all stages of MEC progression , and that the relative contribution of glycolysis over mitochondria for cellular ATP supply increases during MEC progression , favouring growth under low oxygen concentration .	cellular energetics
20113375_s6	In addition , the observed high Prx I protein levels could provide protection to tumour cells against reactive oxygen species generated as a consequence of mitochondrial function and hypoxia-reoxygenation cycling .	
20113375_s7	Altogether our findings suggest that upregulation of Glut-1 and Prx I constitute successful adaptive strategies of MEC cells conferring a growth advantage over normal salivary gland cells in the unstable oxygenation tumour environment .	
20133848_s0	As the result of genetic alterations and tumor hypoxia , many cancer cells avidly take up glucose and generate lactate through lactate dehydrogenase A ( LDHA ) , which is encoded by a target gene of c-Myc and hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF-1 ) .	
20133848_s1	Previous studies with reduction of LDHA expression indicate that LDHA is involved in tumor initiation , but its role in tumor maintenance and progression has not been established .	
20133848_s2	Furthermore , how reduction of LDHA expression by interference or antisense RNA inhibits tumorigenesis is not well understood .	
20133848_s3	Here , we report that reduction of LDHA by siRNA or its inhibition by a small-molecule inhibitor ( FX11 [ 3-dihydroxy-6-methyl-7-(phenylmethyl)-4-propylnaphthalene-1-carboxylic acid] ) reduced ATP levels and induced significant oxidative stress and cell death that could be partially reversed by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine .	
20133848_s4	Furthermore , we document that FX11 inhibited the progression of sizable human lymphoma and pancreatic cancer xenografts .	
20133848_s5	When used in combination with the NAD(+) synthesis inhibitor FK866 , FX11 induced lymphoma regression .	
20133848_s6	Hence , inhibition of LDHA with FX11 is an achievable and tolerable treatment for LDHA-dependent tumors .	
20133848_s7	Our studies document a therapeutical approach to the Warburg effect and demonstrate that oxidative stress and metabolic phenotyping of cancers are critical aspects of cancer biology to consider for the therapeutical targeting of cancer energy metabolism .	cellular energetics
20144215_s0	BACKGROUND Taxol is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with breast cancer .	
20144215_s1	Despite impressive clinical responses initially , the majority of patients eventually develop resistance to Taxol .	
20144215_s2	Lactate dehydrogenase-A ( LDH-A ) is one of the predominant isoforms of LDH expressed in breast tissue , which controls the conversion of pyruvate to lactate and plays an important role in glucose metabolism .	
20144215_s3	In this study we investigated the role of LDH-A in mediating Taxol resistance in human breast cancer cells .	
20144215_s4	RESULTS Taxol-resistant subclones , derived from the cancer cell line MDA-MB-435 , sustained continuous growth in high concentrations of Taxol while the Taxol-sensitive cells could not .	
20144215_s5	The increased expression and activity of LDH-A were detected in Taxol-resistant cells when compared with their parental cells .	
20144215_s6	The downregulation of LDH-A by siRNA significantly increased the sensitivity of Taxol-resistant cells to Taxol .	
20144215_s7	A higher sensitivity to the specific LDH inhibitor , oxamate , was found in the Taxol-resistant cells .	
20144215_s8	Furthermore , treating cells with the combination of Taxol and oxamate showed a synergistical inhibitory effect on Taxol-resistant breast cancer cells by promoting apoptosis in these cells .	
20144215_s9	CONCLUSION LDH-A plays an important role in Taxol resistance and inhibition of LDH-A re-sensitizes Taxol-resistant cells to Taxol .	
20144215_s10	This supports that Warburg effect is a property of Taxol resistant cancer cells and may play an important role in the development of Taxol resistance .	cellular energetics
20144215_s11	To our knowledge , this is the first report showing that the increased expression of LDH-A plays an important role in Taxol resistance of human breast cancer cells .	
20144215_s12	This study provides valuable information for the future development and use of targeted therapies , such as oxamate , for the treatment of patients with Taxol-resistant breast cancer .	
20205716_s0	INTRODUCTION Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs with pleiotropic activities including inhibition of isoprenylation and reduction of signals driving cell proliferation and survival responses .	
20205716_s1	METHODS In this study we evaluated the effects of lovastatin acid and lactone on breast cancer MDAMB231 and MDAMB468 cells using a combination of proteomic and metabonomic profiling techniques .	
20205716_s2	RESULTS Lovastatin inhibited proliferation of breast cancer cell lines .	
20205716_s3	MDAMB231 cells were more sensitive to its effects , and in most cases lovastatin acid showed more potency towards the manipulation of protein expression than lovastatin lactone .	
20205716_s4	Increased expression of Rho inhibitor GDI-2 stabilized the non-active Ras homolog gene family member A ( RhoA ) leading to a decreased expression of its active , membrane-bound form .	
20205716_s5	Its downstream targets cofilin , CDC42 and G3BP1 are members of the GTPase family affected by lovastatin .	
20205716_s6	Our data indicated that lovastatin modulated the E2F1-pathway through the regulation of expression of prohibitin and retinoblastoma ( Rb ) .	
20205716_s7	This subsequently leads to changes of E2F-downstream targets minichromosome maintenance protein 7 ( MCM7 ) and MutS homolog 2 ( MSH2 ) .	
20205716_s8	Lovastatin also regulated the AKT-signaling pathway .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20205716_s9	Increased phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) and decreased DJ-1 expression lead to a down-regulation of the active pAkt .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20205716_s10	Lovastatin's involvement in the AKT-signaling pathway was confirmed by an upregulation of its downstream target , tumor progressor NDRG1 .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20205716_s11	Metabolic consequences to lovastatin exposure included suppression of glycolytic and Krebs cycle activity , and lipid biosynthesis .	
20205716_s12	CONCLUSIONS The combination of proteomics and metabonomics enabled us to identify several key targets essential to the antitumor activity of lovastatin .	
20205716_s13	Our results imply that lovastatin has the potential to reduce the growth of breast cancer cells .	
20217555_s0	Tumor invasion and metastasis are the primary causes of cancer patient mortality , underscoring the need for identification of novel genes and signaling pathways that mediate these prognosis-determining phenomena .	
20217555_s1	To identify and characterize novel lung adenocarcinoma genes associated with lung cancer progression , we created a bioinformatics-based approach that focuses on human cell-cycle-regulated genes that have evolved only in higher organisms but not in lower eukaryotic cells .	
20217555_s2	In siRNA experiments in lung cancer cells , FLJ10540 was identified as one of several novel targets involved in cell migration and invasion .	
20217555_s3	Here , we demonstrate that PI3K inhibition affects FLJ10540-mediated cell migration and invasion and further , that FLJ10540 knockdown ablates AKT-Ser(473) phosphorylation .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
20217555_s4	Taken together , these findings indicate that the FLJ10540/PI3K/AKT pathway may harbor new therapeutic targets for treating invasive lung adenocarcinoma .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20303770_s0	Certain steroidal compounds have demonstrated an antiproliferative effect against several tumor cell lines ; however , their complete role on cancer cells is not currently established .	
20303770_s1	Herein , we report the synthesis and evaluation of two new 26-hydroxy-22-oxocholestanic steroids on cervical cancer CaSki cells .	
20303770_s2	The title compounds were prepared from diosgenin and hecogenin in excellent yields .	
20303770_s3	We determined their effect on cell proliferation , cell cycle , and cell death .	
20303770_s4	The cytotoxic effect of the title compounds on CaSki and human lymphocytes was also evaluated , indicating that the main cell death process is not necrosis ; the null effect on lymphocytes implies that they are not cytotoxic .	resisting cell death
20303770_s5	The observation of apoptotic bodies as well as the increase in the expression of active caspase-3 along with the fragmentation of DNA confirmed that such new cholestanic frameworks induced apoptosis in tumor cells .	resisting cell death
20303770_s6	Significantly , their antiproliferative activity on tumor cells did not affect the proliferative potential of normal fibroblasts from cervix and peripheral blood lymphocytes .	
20303770_s7	The title compounds show selective antitumor activity and therefore serve as promising lead candidates for further optimization .	
20308543_s0	During the course of inflammation and its resolution , macrophages are exposed to various cytotoxic materials , including reactive oxygen species .	
20308543_s1	Thus , macrophages require a protective machinery against oxidative stress to survive at the inflammatory site .	
20308543_s2	Here , we showed that xCT , a component of transport system x(c)(-) , was significantly up-regulated in activated infiltrating cells , including macrophages and neutrophils at the inflammatory site .	tumor promoting inflammation
20308543_s3	System x(c)(-) mediates the uptake of extracellular L-cystine and is consequently responsible for maintenance of intracellular glutathione levels .	
20308543_s4	We established a loss-of-function mouse mutant line of xCT by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis .	
20308543_s5	Macrophages from xCT(mu/mu) mice showed cell death in association with the excessive release of high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 upon stimulation with LPS , suggesting that xCT deficiency causes unremitting inflammation because of the impaired survival of activated macrophages at the inflammatory site .	tumor promoting inflammation
20308543_s6	Subcutaneous injection of 3-methylcholanthrene ( 3-MCA ) induced the generation of fibrosarcoma in association with inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
20308543_s7	When 3-MCA was injected s.c. into mice , xCT mRNA was up-regulated in situ .	
20308543_s8	In xCT(mu/mu) mice , inflammatory cytokines ( such as IL-1beta and TNFalpha ) were overexpressed , and the generation of 3-MCA-induced fibrosarcoma was accelerated .	tumor promoting inflammation
20308543_s9	These results clearly indicate that the defect of the protective system against oxidative stress impaired survival of activated macrophages and subsequently enhanced tumorigenecity .	tumor promoting inflammation
20339958_s0	Currently , there are no satisfactory biomarkers available to screen for nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) .	
20339958_s1	Nitric oxide ( NO ) , produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , has been suggested to cause nitrative and oxidative stress , leading to the accumulation of 8-nitroguanine ( 8-NitroG ) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) and the subsequent transversion mutation of DNA .	
20339958_s2	The aim of this study was to evaluate iNOS expression and the status of nitrative and oxidative stress in NPC .	
20339958_s3	Fifty-nine cases of NPC and 39 cases of chronic nasopharyngitis were investigated to examine the expression of iNOS and the formation of 8-NitroG and 8-OHdG , using double-immunofluorescent staining .	
20339958_s4	The statistical differences in immunoreactivities were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test .	
20339958_s5	Thirty-six patients from the 57 cases of NPC and 36 healthy controls were investigated to examine the level of serum 8-OHdG , using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .	
20339958_s6	The statistical differences were analyzed using a t test .	
20339958_s7	Strong DNA lesions were observed in the cancer cells of NPC patients .	genomic instability and mutation
20339958_s8	All cases of NPC were positive for 8-NitroG and 8-OHdG , and 54 ( 94.7% ) were positive for iNOS .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
20339958_s9	NPC samples exhibited significantly more intense staining for 8-NitroG , 8-OHdG and iNOS than those of chronic nasopharyngitis ( P &lt ; 0.05 , respectively ) .	
20339958_s10	The mean value of serum 8-OHdG in the 36 NPC patients was 0.538 Â± 0.336 ng/ml compared to 0.069 Â± 0.059 ng/ml for the healthy controls .	
20339958_s11	The difference in the serum levels of 8-OHdG between the NPC patients and controls was statistically significant ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
20339958_s12	Our present findings suggest that pathological stimulation of nasopharyngeal tissue , caused by bacterial , viral or parasitic inflammation , may lead to nitrative and oxidative DNA lesions , caused by NO .	tumor promoting inflammation
20339958_s13	This may contribute to the cause and development of NPC .	
20339958_s14	Thus , 8-NitroG and 8-OHdG could be potential biomarkers for evaluating the risk of NPC .	
20339958_s15	Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying nitrative and oxidative DNA damage may provide clues to molecular targets for new approaches of NPC prevention .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
20354187_s0	The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) signaling cascade has been implicated in a wide range of diseases , including cancer .	
20354187_s1	It is unclear how different JNK proteins contribute to human cancer .	
20354187_s2	Here , we report that JNK2 is activated in more than 70% of human squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) samples and that inhibition of JNK2 pharmacologically or genetically impairs tumorigenesis of human SCC cells .	
20354187_s3	Most importantly , JNK2 , but not JNK1 , is sufficient to couple with oncogenic Ras to transform primary human epidermal cells into malignancy with features of SCC .	
20354187_s4	JNK2 prevents Ras-induced cell senescence and growth arrest by reducing the expression levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p16 and the activation of NF-kappaB .	enabling replicative immortality
20354187_s5	On the other hand , JNK , along with phosphoinositide 3-kinase , is essential for Ras-induced glycolysis , an energy-producing process known to benefit cancer growth .	cellular energetics
20354187_s6	These data indicate that JNK2 collaborates with other oncogenes , such as Ras , at multiple molecular levels to promote tumorigenesis and hence represents a promising therapeutic target for cancer .	
20360922_s0	INTRODUCTION Astrocytic gliomas are the most common intracranial central nervous system neoplasias , accounting for about 60% of all primary central nervous system tumors .	
20360922_s1	Despite advances in the treatment of gliomas , no effective therapeutic approach is yet available ; hence , the search for a more realistic model to generate more effective therapies is essential .	
20360922_s2	OBJECTIVE To develop an experimental malignant astrocytoma model with the characteristics of the human tumor .	
20360922_s3	METHOD Primary cells from subcutaneous xenograft tumors produced with malignant astrocytoma U87MG cells were inoculated intracerebrally by stereotaxis into immunosuppressed ( athymic ) Rowett rats .	
20360922_s4	RESULTS All four injected animals developed non-infiltrative tumors , although other glioblastoma characteristics , such as necrosis , pseudopalisading cells and intense mitotic activity , were observed .	resisting cell death
20360922_s5	CONCLUSION A malignant astrocytoma intracerebral xenograft model with poorly invasive behavior was achieved in athymic Rowett rats .	
20360922_s6	Tumor invasiveness in an experimental animal model may depend on a combination of several factors , including the cell line used to induce tumor formation , the rat strains and the status of the animal's immune system .	
20398056_s0	Obesity and related metabolic abnormalities are risk factors for colorectal cancer .	
20398056_s1	A state of chronic inflammation and adipocytokine imbalance may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis .	
20398056_s2	Statins , which are commonly used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia , are known to possess anti-inflammatory effects .	
20398056_s3	Statins also exert chemopreventive properties against various cancers .	
20398056_s4	The present study examined the effects of pitavastatin , a recently developed lipophilic statin , on the development of azoxymethane ( AOM)-initiated colonic premalignant lesions in C57BL/KsJ-db/db ( db/db ) obese mice .	
20398056_s5	Male db/db mice were administrated weekly subcutaneous injections of AOM ( 15 mg/kg body weight ) for 4 weeks and then were subsequently fed a diet containing 1 ppm or 10 ppm pitavastatin for 8 weeks .	
20398056_s6	Feeding with either dose of pitavastatin significantly reduced the number of colonic premalignant lesions , beta-catenin accumulated crypts , by inhibiting proliferation and the surrounding inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
20398056_s7	Pitavastatin increased the serum levels of adiponectin while conversely decreasing the serum levels of total cholesterol , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , interleukin ( IL)-6 , IL-18 , and leptin .	
20398056_s8	Pitavastatin also caused a significant increase in the expression of phosphorylated form of the AMP-activated kinase ( AMPK ) protein on the colonic mucosa of AOM-treated mice .	
20398056_s9	In addition , the expression levels of TNF-alpha , IL-6 , IL-18 , and COX-2 mRNAs on the colonic mucosa of AOM-treated mice were decreased by treatment with this agent .	tumor promoting inflammation
20398056_s10	These findings suggest that pitavastatin attenuates chronic inflammation and improves the imbalance of adipocytokines , both of which are caused by the presence of excess adipose tissues , thereby preventing the development of colonic premalignancies in an obesity-related colon cancer model .	tumor promoting inflammation
20398056_s11	Therefore , some types of statins , including pitavastatin , may be a useful chemoprevention modality for colon cancer in obese individuals .	
20419261_s0	Principal components analysis ( PCA ) combined to Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) microspectroscopic imaging was used to screen biochemical changes associated to C6 glioma tumor from 7 to 19 days growth .	
20419261_s1	Normal brain and tumor obtained at 7 , 12 , 19 days after C6 cell injection were used to develop a diagnostic model of brain glioma based on PCA analysis .	
20419261_s2	This classification model was validated using extra-measurements on normal and tumor at 9 and 15 days post-implantation .	
20419261_s3	The spatial and biochemical information obtained from FTIR/PCA maps can be used to improve the discrimination between normal and grading human glioma .	
20419261_s4	The first 4 PCs which account for more than 93.6% of total spectral variance were used to construct pseudo-color scores maps and compared each map to the corresponding hematoxylin and eosin ( H&amp;E ) staining .	
20419261_s5	Our results reported that by correlating pseudocolor map scores with H&amp;E staining it was possible to screen histological changes associated with tissue transformation .	
20419261_s6	In fact , PC1 and PC4 were associated to the tumor , surrounding tumor and necrosis .	resisting cell death
20419261_s7	Indeed , at day 7 after tumor implantation , FTIR investigations displayed a very small abnormal zone associated with the proliferation of C6 cells in the caudate putamen ( CP ) .	
20419261_s8	PC2 and PC3 described normal brain structures such as white matter ( corpus callosum ( CC ) and commissura anterior ( CA) ) and some cortex layers ( grey matter ) .	
20419261_s9	After delipidation of the tissues , we were still able to differentiate between different tissue features based on nucleic acid and protein content .	
20419261_s10	By comparing the patterns of the PC loads with the spectra of lipids extracted from white and gray matters , and DNA , we have identified some biochemical changes associated with tissue transformation .	
20419261_s11	This work demonstrated that our classification model provides a successful histological classification of different brain structures .	
20426969_s0	OBJECTIVE To explore the association between DNA damage induced by vinyl chloride monomer ( VCM ) and polymorphisms of DNA repair genes and xenobiotic metabolism genes of VCM .	
20426969_s1	METHODS Comet assay was employed to detect DNA damage .	
20426969_s2	Based on the status of DNA damage , the VCM exposure workers were divided into two groups : DNA damage group ( 75 ) and control group ( 75 ) .	
20426969_s3	Case-control design was used to investigate the association between the genetic polymorphisms and DNA damage induced by VCM .	
20426969_s4	Genotypes of XRCC1 ( Arg194Trp , Arg280His and Arg399Gln ) , XPD ( Ile199Met , Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln ) and CYP2E1 were identified by the PCR-RFLP .	
20426969_s5	PCR assay was used to detect positive and null genotype of GSTT1 and GSTM1 .	
20426969_s6	RESULTS Univariate analysis showed that the CYP2E1 c1c2/c2c2 and XPD751 Lys/Gln and Gln/Gln genotypes were significantly associated with the increased levels of DNA damage , XRCCI 339 Arg/Gln and Gln/Gln genotypes were significantly associated with the decreased levels of DNA damage ( P &lt ; 0.01 , P &lt ; 0.05 , respectively ) .	genomic instability and mutation
20426969_s7	Logistic regression analysis showed that there was significant association between the genotypes of XRCC1 194 , XRCC1 399 , XPD 751 , CYP2E1 and DNA damages .	genomic instability and mutation
20426969_s8	A prominent risk decreasing of DNA damage was observed for those individuals possessing XRCC1 399Arg/Gln + Gln/Gln genotypes ( OR : 0.35 , 95%CI : 0.12 approximately 1.01 , respectively ) ; The results also showed that there were significant associations between CYP2E1 c1c2/c2c2 and DNA damage both in high and low VCM-exposed groups ( OR : 2.57 , 95%CI : 1.01 approximately 6.59 and OR : 2.57 , 95%CI : 0.99 approximately 6.87 ) .	
20426969_s9	CONCLUSION Cumulative exposure dose and genotypes of XRCC1 194 , XRCC1 399 , XPD 751 and CYP2E1 may modulate the DNA damage induced by VCM exposure .	genomic instability and mutation
20525350_s0	BACKGROUND The immune system plays an important role in the multifactorial biologic system during the development of neoplasias .	
20525350_s1	However , the involvement of the inflammatory response in the promotion/control of malignant cells is still controversial , and the cell subsets and the mechanisms involved are poorly investigated .	
20525350_s2	The goal of this study was to characterize the clinical-pathological status and the immunophenotyping profile of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and their association with the animal survival rates in canine mammary carcinomas .	
20525350_s3	METHODS Fifty-one animals with mammary carcinomas , classified as carcinomas in mixed tumors-MC-BMT = 31 and carcinomas-MC = 20 were submitted to systematic clinical-pathological analysis ( tumor size ; presence of lymph node and pulmonary metastasis ; clinical stage ; histological grade ; inflammatory distribution and intensity as well as the lymphocytic infiltrate intensity ) and survival rates .	
20525350_s4	Twenty-four animals ( MC-BMT = 16 and MC = 8 ) were elected to the immunophenotypic study performed by flow cytometry .	
20525350_s5	RESULTS Data analysis demonstrated that clinical stage II-IV and histological grade was I more frequent in MC-BMT as compared to MC .	
20525350_s6	Univariate analysis demonstrated that the intensity of inflammation ( moderate/intense ) and the proportion of CD4+ ( &gt ; or = 66.7% ) or CD8+ T-cells ( &lt;33.3% ) were not associated with worse survival rate .	tumor promoting inflammation
20525350_s7	Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only lymphocytic infiltrate intensity &gt ; or = 600 ( P = 0.02 ) remained as independent prognostic factor .	
20525350_s8	Despite the clinical manifestation , the lymphocytes represented the predominant cell type in the tumor infiltrate .	
20525350_s9	The percentage of T-cells was higher in animals with MC-BMT without metastasis , while the percentage of B-lymphocytes was greater in animals with metastasized MC-BMT ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
20525350_s10	The relative percentage of CD4+ T-cells was significantly greater in metastasized tumors ( both MC-BMT and MC ) , ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) while the proportion of CD8+ T-cells was higher in MC-BMT without metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
20525350_s11	Consequently , the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly increased in both groups with metastasis .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
20525350_s12	Regardless of the tumor type , the animals with high proportions of CD4+ and low CD8+ T-cells had decreased survival rates .	avoiding immune destruction
20525350_s13	CONCLUSION The intensity of lymphocytic infiltrate and probably the relative abundance of the CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes may represent important survival prognostic biomarkers for canine mammary carcinomas .	avoiding immune destruction
20559452_s0	Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive cancer with a greater than 95% mortality rate and short survival after diagnosis .	
20559452_s1	Chemotherapeutic resistance hinders successful treatment .	
20559452_s2	This resistance is often associated with mutations in codon 12 of the K-Ras gene ( K-Ras 12 ) , which is present in over 90% of all pancreatic adenocarcinomas .	
20559452_s3	Codon 12 mutations maintain Ras in a constitutively active state leading to continuous cellular proliferation .	
20559452_s4	Our study determined if TRAIL resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinomas with K-Ras 12 mutations could be overcome by first sensitizing the cells with Benzyl isothiocyanate ( BITC ) .	
20559452_s5	BITC is a component of cruciferous vegetables and a cell cycle inhibitor .	
20559452_s6	BxPC3 , MiaPaCa2 and Panc-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were examined for TRAIL resistance .	
20559452_s7	Our studies show BITC induced TRAIL sensitization by dual activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways .	resisting cell death
20574925_s0	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) is an endemic malignant disease of the head and neck region with unique features including striking ethnic and geographic variations as well as multifactorial etiology .	
20574925_s1	Previous studies have demonstrated the anticancer properties of genistein , the major soy isoflavonoid , in several human cancer cells such as breast , prostate , colon , gastric , lung , and hepatoma .	
20574925_s2	However , the action of genistein in NPC cells has not been determined .	
20574925_s3	In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effects of genistein on NPC cells and its possible underlying mechanisms .	
20574925_s4	We found that genistein dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human NPC cell line CNE2 cells .	
20574925_s5	DNA flow cytometric analysis revealed that 30 to 120 microM genistein induced dramatic G2/M phase arrest in NPC cells .	evading growth suppressors
20574925_s6	The mRNA expression levels , as shown by gene expression array and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , and the protein expression levels of the cell cycle regulators p21(Cip1) and ATR ( Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related ) were elevated following genistein treatment .	evading growth suppressors
20574925_s7	Interestingly , we also observed concomitant induction of p15(Ink4b) in genistein induced inhibitory effects in NPC cells .	
20574925_s8	Moreover , selective estrogen receptor modulators did not affect genistein induced growth inhibition .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20574925_s9	These findings provide new insights into the potential intervention of NPC with genistein .	
20640572_s0	Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) is generally considered to be immunosuppressive but recent findings suggest this characterization oversimplifies its role in disease pathogenesis .	
20640572_s1	Recently , we showed that IDO is essential for tumor outgrowth in the classical two-stage model of inflammatory skin carcinogenesis .	
20640572_s2	Here , we report that IDO loss did not exacerbate classical inflammatory responses .	
20640572_s3	Rather , IDO induction could be elicited by environmental signals and tumor promoters as an integral component of the inflammatory tissue microenvironment even in the absence of cancer .	tumor promoting inflammation
20640572_s4	IDO loss had limited impact on tumor outgrowth in carcinogenesis models that lacked an explicit inflammatory tumor promoter .	tumor promoting inflammation
20640572_s5	In the context of inflammatory carcinogenesis where IDO was critical to tumor development , the most important source of IDO was radiation-resistant non-hematopoietic cells , consistent with evidence that loss of the IDO regulatory tumor suppressor gene Bin1 in transformed skin cells facilitates IDO-mediated immune escape by a cell autonomous mechanism .	tumor promoting inflammation
20640572_s6	Taken together , our results identify IDO as an integral component of ' cancer-associated ' inflammation that tilts the immune system toward tumor support .	tumor promoting inflammation
20640572_s7	More generally , they promote the concept that mediators of immune escape and cancer-associated inflammation may be genetically synonymous .	tumor promoting inflammation
20664062_s0	Cellular senescence is a mechanism to inhibit the growth of mammalian cells after oncogenic activation , or in response to damage or stress .	
20664062_s1	We describe here the identification of a novel gene , SENEX , that regulates stress induced premature senescence pathways in endothelial cells ( ECs ) involving p16(INK4a) and retinoblastoma protein activation .	
20664062_s2	Endogenous levels of SENEX remain unchanged during replicative senescence but are regulated by H(2)O(2)-mediated stress .	enabling replicative immortality
20664062_s3	In contrast to that previously described for senescence in other cell types , the SENEX induced senescent ECs are profoundly anti-inflammatory .	enabling replicative immortality,tumor promoting inflammation
20664062_s4	The cells are resistant to tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)Î±-induced apoptosis , adhesion of neutrophils and mononuclear cells , and the surface ( but not cytoplasmic ) expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 .	resisting cell death
20664062_s5	Furthermore they are resistant to thrombin induced vascular leak .	
20664062_s6	Senescent ECs such as those lining atherosclerotic lesions may therefore function to limit the inflammatory response .	enabling replicative immortality,tumor promoting inflammation
20664062_s7	SENEX is also essential for EC survival since depletion either ectopically by siRNA or by high- dose H(2)O(2) treatment causes apoptosis .	resisting cell death
20664062_s8	Together , these findings expand our understanding of the role of senescence in the vasculature and identify SENEX as a fulcrum for driving the resultant phenotype of the endothelium after activation .	enabling replicative immortality
20679748_s0	AIM To compare the value of intravenous contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ( US ) , intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( CT ) , and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas .	
20679748_s1	MATERIAL AND METHODS The study enrolled 48 patients , aged between 20 and 79 years ( 35 [ 72.9% ] women , 13 [ 27.1% ] men ; mean age , 53.5+/-12.855 years ) , who were examined and treated in the Departments of Gastroenterology , Surgery , and Oncology , Hospital of Kaunas University of Medicine , in the year 2007 .	
20679748_s2	All patients underwent intravenous contrast-enhanced US , intravenous contrast-enhanced CT , and MRI and were diagnosed with hepatic hemangioma according to the findings of these examinations .	
20679748_s3	RESULTS The size of hemangiomas was &lt ; or =2.0 cm in 20 cases ( 41.7% ) and &gt;2.0 cm in 28 ( 58.3% ) .	
20679748_s4	No association between hepatic hemangioma and patient's age was found ( chi(2)=0.547 , df=2 , P=0.761 ) .	
20679748_s5	Nearly one-third of hemangiomas were located in the segment IV of the left hepatic lobe .	
20679748_s6	There were a few complicated hemangiomas in the study sample : 2 with calcification and 1 with necrosis .	resisting cell death
20679748_s7	The sensitivity of CT in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma was 76.92% ; specificity , 33.3% ; positive prognostic value , 83.3% ; and negative prognostic value , 25.0% .	
20679748_s8	The sensitivity of intravenous contrast-enhanced US in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma was 77.8% ; specificity , 100% ; positive prognostic value , 100% ; and negative prognostic value , 23.1% .	
20679748_s9	CONCLUSIONS Intravenous contrast-enhanced US is more specific than intravenous contrast-enhanced CT in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma ( P=0.0005 ) and has a higher positive prognostic value ( P=0.001 ) .	
20686229_s0	Genipin is a metabolite of geniposide isolated from an extract of Gardenia fructus .	
20686229_s1	Some observations suggested that genipin could induce cell apoptosis in hepatoma cells and PC3 human prostate cancer cells .	
20686229_s2	However , the effects of genipin on HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells are still unknown .	
20686229_s3	In this study , we provided evidences that genipin induced the death of HeLa cells through apoptotic pathway in a dose-dependent manner .	
20686229_s4	Genipin could remarkably induce cytotoxicity in HeLa cells and inhibit its proliferation .	
20686229_s5	Induction of the apoptosis by genipin was confirmed by analysis of DNA fragmentation and induction of sub-G(1) peak through flow cytometry .	resisting cell death
20686229_s6	The results also showed that genipin-treated HeLa cells cycle was arrested at G(1) phase .	evading growth suppressors
20686229_s7	Western blot analysis revealed that the phosphorylated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) protein , phospho-Jun protein , p53 protein and bax protein significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner after treatment of genipin for 24 h , and to our knowledge , the activation of JNK maybe result in the increase of the p53 protein level , and the increase of the p53 protein led to the accumulation of bax protein , bax protein further induced cell apoptotic death eventually .	
20686229_s8	Taken all these together , it is possible to develop genipin as an anti-cancer drug .	
20706593_s0	BACKGROUND The Mutyh DNA glycosylase is involved in the repair of oxidized DNA bases .	
20706593_s1	Mutations in the human MUTYH gene are responsible for colorectal cancer in familial adenomatous polyposis .	
20706593_s2	Since defective DNA repair genes might contribute to the increased cancer risk associated with inflammatory bowel diseases , we compared the inflammatory response of wild-type and Mutyh(-/-) mice to oxidative stress .	
20706593_s3	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The severity of colitis , changes in expression of genes involved in DNA repair and inflammation , DNA 8-oxoguanine levels and microsatellite instability were analysed in colon of mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) .	genomic instability and mutation,tumor promoting inflammation
20706593_s4	The Mutyh(-/-) phenotype was associated with a significant accumulation of 8-oxoguanine in colon DNA of treated mice .	genomic instability and mutation
20706593_s5	A single DSS cycle induced severe acute ulcerative colitis in wild-type mice , whereas lesions were modest in Mutyh(-/-) mice , and this was associated with moderate variations in the expression of several cytokines .	
20706593_s6	Eight DSS cycles caused chronic colitis in both wild-type and Mutyh(-/-) mice .	
20706593_s7	Lymphoid hyperplasia and a significant reduction in Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells were observed only in Mutyh(-/-) mice .	
20706593_s8	CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that , in this model of ulcerative colitis , Mutyh plays a major role in maintaining intestinal integrity by affecting the inflammatory response .	
20737228_s0	n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) have a chemopreventive effect while n-6 PUFA promote carcinogenesis .	
20737228_s1	The effect of these essential fatty acids may be related to oxidative stress .	
20737228_s2	Therefore , the study was designed to evaluate the effect of different ratios of fish oil ( FO ) and corn oil ( CO ) in the prevention of colon cancer .	
20737228_s3	Male Wistar rats were divided into control , dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride ( DMH ) treated , FO + CO ( 1:1 ) and FO + CO ( 2.5:1 ) .	
20737228_s4	All the groups , except the control received a weekly injection of DMH for 4 weeks .	
20737228_s5	The animals were sacrificed either 48 h later ( initiation phase ) or kept for 16 weeks ( post initiation phase ) .	
20737228_s6	DMH treatment in the initiation phase animals showed mild to moderate inflammation , decreased ROS and TrxR activity , increased antioxidants , apoptosis and ACF multiplicity .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20737228_s7	The post initiation study showed severe inflammation with hyperplasia , increased ACF multiplicity and ROS levels , a decrease in antioxidants and apoptosis .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20737228_s8	The FO + CO ( 1:1 ) treated animals showed severe inflammation , a decrease in ROS , an increase in antioxidants and apoptosis in the initiation phase .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20737228_s9	FO + CO ( 1:1 ) in the post initiation phase and FO + CO ( 2.5:1 ) in the initiation showed mild inflammation , increased ROS , apoptosis and decreased antioxidants .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20737228_s10	There was a decrease in ACF multiplicity and ROS levels , increased antioxidants and apoptosis in the post initiation phase study .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20737228_s11	The present study suggests that FO has a dose- and time-dependent chemopreventive effect in colon cancer mediated through oxidative stress and apoptosis .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
20924143_s0	Cetuximab is a chimeric antibody registered for the therapy of advanced colorectal carcinoma .	
20924143_s1	Cancer and anticancer therapy are associated with oxidative stress , and disorders of antioxidant balance may be involved in the toxicity associated with anticancer treatment .	
20924143_s2	The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes of serum retinol , alpha-tocopherol and C-reactive protein during the first month of treatment with cetuximab and chemotherapy .	
20924143_s3	Twenty-five consecutive patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with a combination of chemotherapy and cetuximab were included in the present study .	
20924143_s4	Serum retinol and alpha-tocopherol were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and serum C-reactive protein was determined using commercial kits .	
20924143_s5	Significant correlation was observed between baseline concentrations of retinol and C-reactive protein ( r(s)=-0.54 , p&lt;0.01 ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
20924143_s6	Median survival of patients who had baseline serum retinol below 1.25 Âµmol/L was 10 mo compared to 18 mo for patients who had serum retinol equal or above 1.25 Âµmol/L ( p&lt;0.05 ) ; median survival of patients who had serum C-reactive protein below 24 mg/L was significantly longer compared to patients with C-reactive protein levels equal or above 24 mg/L ( 18 vs. 7 mo , p&lt;0.05 ) , but no difference in survival was observed based on alpha-tocopherol levels .	
20924143_s7	Twenty-two patients had evaluation of retinol , alpha-tocopherol and C-reactive protein at least once during the follow up .	
20924143_s8	Serum concentration of alpha-tocopherol decreased significantly during the therapy , but retinol and C-reactive protein concentrations remained unchanged .	
20924143_s9	In conclusion , a significant correlation was observed between serum retinol and C-reactive protein .	tumor promoting inflammation
20924143_s10	Serum alpha-tocopherol decreased significantly during the first month of combination therapy with cetuximab .	
20924143_s11	Low retinol and high C-reactive protein concentrations were predictive of poor prognosis in this patient population .	
20926896_s0	BACKGROUND Apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 ( ASPP ) family members can stimulate the apoptotic function of p53 but have no impact on its cell cycle arrest function .	
20926896_s1	MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression pattern of the ASPP family consisting of ASPP1 , ASPP2 , and iASPP was examined by immunohistochemistry in 45 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma ( EEA ) specimens and 26 normal endometrial tissue ( NET ) samples .	
20926896_s2	RESULTS The expression rates of ASPP1 and ASPP2 in EEA were significantly lower than those in NET ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
20926896_s3	However , the iASPP expression rate in EEA was statistically higher in contrast to NET ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	
20926896_s4	Expression of ASPP1 and iASPP in EEA had no correlation with any clinicopathological features ( p &gt ; 0.05). iASPP was associated with grade , invasion , and lymph node metastasis ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis
20926896_s5	CONCLUSIONS It is a novel finding that the expression pattern of the ASPP family members has respective pathological and clinical implications in EEA , and iASPP might be a candidate target for EEA therapy .	
20943596_s0	BACKGROUND Breast cancer is less common in China than in the United States and perinatal characteristics predict breast cancer risk in the offspring .	
20943596_s1	We determined levels of pregnancy hormones in Boston and Shanghai to identify those possibly involved in the intrauterine origin of breast cancer .	
20943596_s2	Participants and methods : We compared maternal and cord blood levels of estradiol , estriol , testosterone , progesterone , prolactin , insulin-like growth factors ( IGF ) 1 and 2 , insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 , adiponectin and sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) in 241 Caucasian and 295 Chinese women .	
20943596_s3	RESULTS In both centers , hormone levels at the 16th were predictive of those at the 27th gestational week , but there was little correlation between maternal and cord blood levels .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20943596_s4	In cord blood , we found significantly ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) higher levels of estradiol ( 44.2% ) , testosterone ( 54.5% ) , IGF-2 ( 22.7% ) and strikingly SHBG ( 104.6% ) in Shanghai women , whereas the opposite was true for IGF-1 ( -36.8% ) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
20943596_s5	CONCLUSIONS Taking into account the current understanding of the plausible biological role of the examined endocrine factors , those likely to be involved in the intrauterine origin of breast cancer are SHBG and IGF-2 , with higher cord blood levels among Chinese , and IGF-1 , with higher cord blood levels among Caucasian women .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21030797_s0	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of high-resolution MRI ( HR-MRI ) and proton MR spectroscopy ( (1)H-MRS ) for monitoring the early therapeutic response to radiotherapy .	
21030797_s1	Twenty rabbits with VX2 carcinoma were divided into control ( n = 8 ) and irradiation ( n = 12 ) groups .	
21030797_s2	The irradiation group underwent HR-MRI and ( 1)H-MRS using a microscopy coil at 1 , 3 , 7 or 14 days after irradiation .	
21030797_s3	Rabbits in the control group were subjected to HR-MRI and ( 1)H-MRS at the same time intervals .	
21030797_s4	All rabbits were killed after imaging and subjected to histopathologic examinations .	
21030797_s5	The diameter of necrosis by HR-MRI was then compared to that on the gross specimens .	
21030797_s6	The ratios of choline/creatine ( Cho/Cr ) and lactate/creatine ( Lac/Cr ) on the tumor and necrotic area detected by in vivo ( 1)H-MRS were compared between the control and irradiation groups , respectively .	
21030797_s7	In addition , the ratios of Cho/Cr and Lac/Cr were compared between the tumor and necrotic area in each irradiation group .	resisting cell death
21030797_s8	A significant correlation was found between the diameter of necrosis in each sequence of HR-MRI and that in the gross specimens ( r = 0.84-0.91 , p = 0.03- &lt ; 0.003 ) .	resisting cell death
21030797_s9	The ratios of Lac/Cr in the tumors of the irradiation groups were significantly higher than those in the control groups after 1 day and 3 days of irradiation ( p = 0.04 , and p = 0.02 ) .	
21030797_s10	Histological analysis showed necrosis and swelling of the endothelia of capillaries and arterioles at 1 day and 3 days after irradiation .	resisting cell death
21030797_s11	It was suggested that HR-MRI and ( 1)H-MRS are useful methods for monitoring the early therapeutic response to radiotherapy .	
21058195_s0	Over the past two decades , bioactive natural compounds have been shown to be a plausible adjunct to the treatment of breast cancer , the second leading cause of cancer death among American women .	
21058195_s1	This study was designed to investigate the effects of ursolic acid ( UA ) , a pentacyclic triterpene found in many foods and herbs , in a model of postmenopausal breast cancer .	
21058195_s2	Ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice ( n = 40 ) were randomized to receive control diet ( AIN-93G ) or diet supplemented with UA at 1 of 3 doses ( wt/wt ) : 0.05% , 0.10% , or 0.25% ( â54 , 106 , or 266 mg/kg body weight/day , respectively ) .	
21058195_s3	After 3 wk , syngeneic MMTV-Wnt-1 mammary tumor cells were injected in the mammary fat pad , and mice continued on their respective diets for 5 more wk .	
21058195_s4	All UA doses decreased tumor cell proliferation , as assessed by Ki67 immunostaining ; nevertheless , UA at 0.10% was most effective in inhibiting tumor take and decreasing tumor final tumor size .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21058195_s5	Modulation of Akt/mTOR signaling and induction of apoptosis appeared to mediate these effects on tumor growth .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling

21092281_s0	BACKGROUND Human T-cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV-I ) has efficiently adapted to its host and establishes a persistent infection characterized by low levels of viral gene expression and slow proliferation of HTLV-I infected cells over decades .	
21092281_s1	We have previously found that HTLV-I p30 is a negative regulator of virus expression .	
21092281_s2	RESULTS In this study we show that p30 targets multiple cell cycle checkpoints resulting in a delayed entry into S phase .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
21092281_s3	We found that p30 binds to cyclin E and CDK2 and prevents the formation of active cyclin E-CDK2 complexes .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
21092281_s4	In turn , this decreases the phosphorylation levels of Rb and prevents the release of E2F and its transcriptional activation of genes required for G1/S transition .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
21092281_s5	Our studies also show that HTLV-II p28 does not bind cyclin E and does not affect cell cycle progression .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
21092281_s6	CONCLUSIONS In contrast to HTLV-I , the HTLV-II-related retrovirus is not oncogenic in humans .	
21092281_s7	Here we report that the HTLV-I p30 delays cell cycle progression while its homologue , HTLV-II p28 , does not , providing evidence for important differences between these two related retrovirus proteins .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
21118808_s0	We recently showed that Nox4 NADPH oxidase is highly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and that it is activated by growth factors and plays a pro-survival , anti-apoptotic role .	
21118808_s1	Here we investigate the mechanisms through which insulin-like growth factor I and serum ( FBS ) activate NADPH oxidase in pancreatic cancer ( PaCa ) cells .	
21118808_s2	We show that in PaCa cells , NADPH oxidase is composed of Nox4 and p22(phox) catalytic subunits , which are both required for NADPH oxidase activity .	
21118808_s3	Insulin-like growth factor I and FBS activate NADPH oxidase through transcriptional up-regulation of p22(phox) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21118808_s4	This involves activation of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB mediated by Akt kinase .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21118808_s5	Up-regulation of p22(phox) by the growth factors results in increased Nox4-p22(phox) complex formation and activation of NADPH oxidase .	
21118808_s6	This mechanism is different from that for receptor-induced activation of phagocytic NADPH oxidase , which is mediated by phosphorylation of its regulatory subunits .	
21118808_s7	Up-regulation of p22(phox) represents a novel pro-survival mechanism through which growth factors and Akt inhibit apoptosis in PaCa cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21125741_s0	INTRODUCTION Clinical and experimental studies indicate oxygen free radicals and their reactive derivatives participation in formation of chronic inflammation states , which facilitate gastrointestinal tract tumors development .	
21125741_s1	During malignant changes formation in epithelium of gastrointestinal tract increased oxygen radicals generation initiates lipid peroxidation and DNA and proteins oxidation processes .	
21125741_s2	Final lipid peroxidation products ( saturated and unsaturated aldehydes ) are highly reactive and characterized by greatly longer half life time than reactive oxygen species and capability to diffuse from places of their formation to distant cell areas .	
21125741_s3	In cells they react with important biological macromolecules such as DNA and proteins causing their structural and functional damages .	
21125741_s4	The effects of changes in cell membranes structure are increase in their permeability , depolarization , decrease of hydrophobicity and inhibition of enzymes , membrane channels and transporters .	
21125741_s5	These changes lead to the loss of cell integrity .	
21125741_s6	STUDY AIM Determination of lipid peroxidation level in blood serum patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors .	
21125741_s7	MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials for studies were obtained from 170 patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors : 10 with stomach cancer , 20 with pancreatic cancer , 30 with primary liver cancer , 60 with primary colorectal cancer and 50 with metachronic colorectal cancer liver metastases .	
21125741_s8	Blood was taken from patients 1 day before and 6 days after surgery .	
21125741_s9	Control blood was obtained from 53 healthy blood donors .	
21125741_s10	Lipid peroxidation level was determined spectrophotometrically as a concentration of final lipid peroxidation products , which in reaction with tiobarbituric acid ( TBA ) form colour complex ( thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances , TBARS ) .	
21125741_s11	RESULTS Higher lipid peroxidation level was observed in pre- and postoperative blood sera patients with gastrointestinal tumors in comparison to serum from healthy blood donors .	tumor promoting inflammation
21125741_s12	CONCLUSIONS Increased lipid peroxidation level in peripheral blood of patients with gastrointestinal tract tumors is evidence of intensive oxidative stress and might indicate impairment of antioxidant defense mechanisms in organism .	tumor promoting inflammation
21188035_s0	Cyclin-dependent kinases are most extensively studied targets for cancer chemotherapy since the tumor cells exhibit false checkpoints and can proliferate even if the genome is compromised .	
21188035_s1	Cyclin-dependent kinases ensure the tight regulation of the cell cycle execution by mediating phosphorylation of cellular proteins .	
21188035_s2	Deregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity by cellular and external factors leads to many diseases like cancers .	
21188035_s3	Different methods like radiolabeled , fluorescence and luminescence are available for screening of library of compounds against kinases .	
21188035_s4	However , bioluminescent methods offer several advantages like low background and no effect of fluorescent compound interference .	
21188035_s5	Present study is focused on development , optimization and validation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 assay which is suitable for identification potent and selective , ATP competitive and non-competitive inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 .	
21188035_s6	The aim of present investigation was to optimize the assay for cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cylin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E with use of bioluminescence based biochemical reaction .	
21188035_s7	Both cyclin-dependent kinase 2 which are cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E complexes , have different affinity for ATP .	
21188035_s8	Therefore , both isoform analogs of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 were optimized separately .	
21188035_s9	Optimum cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E concentration were found to be 250 ng/well and 200 ng/well , respectively .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
21188035_s10	Optimum substrate ( histone H1 ) concentration was found to be 2.5 mg/ml for both cyclin-dependent kinase 2 analogs .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
21188035_s11	Optimum reaction time was found to be 20 min for both cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin complexes .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
21196431_s0	Isolinderanolide B ( IOB ) , a butanolide extracted from the stems of Cinnamomum subavenium , was investigated for its antiproliferative activity in T24 human bladder cancer cells .	
21196431_s1	To identity the anticancer mechanism of IOB , its effect on apoptosis , cell cycle distribution , and levels of p53 , p21 Waf1/Cip1 , Fas/APO-1 receptor , and Fas ligand was assayed .	
21196431_s2	Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the G0/G1 phase arrest is because of increase in the expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1 .	evading growth suppressors
21196431_s3	An enhancement in Fas/APO-1 and membrane-bound Fas ligand ( mFasL ) might be responsible for the apoptotic effect induced by IOB .	resisting cell death
21196431_s4	This study reports the novel finding that the induction of p21 Waf1/Cip1 and activity of the Fas/mFas ligand apoptotic system may participate in the antiproliferative activity of IOB in T24 cells .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
21203423_s0	BACKGROUND Nucleolin is one of the major proteins of the nucleolus , but it is also expressed on the cell surface where is serves as a binding protein for variety of ligands implicated in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis .	
21203423_s1	Emerging evidence suggests that the cell-surface expressed nucleolin is a strategic target for an effective and nontoxic cancer therapy .	
21203423_s2	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS By monitoring the expression of nucleolin mRNA , and by measuring the level of nucleolin protein recovered from the surface and nucleus of cells , here we show that the presence of nucleolin at the cell surface is dependent on the constant induction of nucleolin mRNA .	
21203423_s3	Indeed , inhibitors of RNA transcription or translation block expression of surface nucleolin while no apparent effect is observed on the level of nucleolin in the nucleus .	
21203423_s4	The estimated half-life of surface nucleolin is less than one hour , whereas that of nuclear nucleolin is more than 8 hours .	
21203423_s5	Nucleolin mRNA induction is reduced markedly in normal fibroblasts that reach confluence , while it occurs continuously even in post-confluent epithelial tumor cells consistent with their capacity to proliferate without contact inhibition .	evading growth suppressors
21203423_s6	Interestingly , cold and heat shock induce nucleolin mRNA concomitantly to enhanced mRNA expression of the heat shock protein 70 , thus suggesting that surface nucleolin induction also occurs in response to an environmental insult .	
21203423_s7	At the cell surface , one of the main functions of nucleolin is to shuttle specific extracellular ligands by an active transport mechanism , which we show here to be calcium dependent .	
21203423_s8	CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE Our results demonstrate that the expression of surface nucleolin is an early metabolic event coupled with tumor cell proliferation and stress response .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21203423_s9	The fact that surface nucleolin is constantly and abundantly expressed on the surface of tumor cells , makes them a preferential target for the inhibitory action of anticancer agents that target surface nucleolin .	
21220911_s0	BACKGROUND/AIMS Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) have been implicated in antitumor therapy for hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumors .	
21220911_s1	Cell-contact and soluble factors are demonstrated to play a role in the growth inhibition of tumor cells mediated by MSCs in vitro , while there is little clue about signaling pathways involved in the process .	
21220911_s2	P38 MAPK has been implicated as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis .	
21220911_s3	We here investigate whether p38 MAPK is involved in MSC-induced growth inhibition of leukemic tumor cells .	
21220911_s4	Methods : We characterized the effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells ( UC-MSCs ) on proliferation , cell cycle and phosphorylation pattern of p38 MAPK in HL60 and K562 cells .	
21220911_s5	SB203580 , a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK , or p38 MAPK-small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , were used to identify the role of p38 in growth suppression by UC-MSCs .	
21220911_s6	We also investigated the expression of cell cycle regulators .	
21220911_s7	RESULTS Treatment with UC-MSCs led to potent proliferation-inhibition of HL60 and K562 cells without inducing apoptosis .	
21220911_s8	Growth inhibition by UC-MSCs was due to G0/G1 arrest .	evading growth suppressors
21220911_s9	UC-MSCs increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HL60 and K562 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21220911_s10	Pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing ( through siRNA ) of p38 MAPK partially abrogated the proliferation-suppression and cell cycle arrest caused by UC-MSCs .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21220911_s11	UC-MSCs also modulated the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in HL60 and K562 cells while SB203580 reversed the effect .	
21220911_s12	CONCLUSION Taken together , our findings indicate that p38 MAPK is critical for the growth inhibitory effect of UC-MSCs on leukemic tumor cells .	
21400522_s0	AIMS Angiogenesis from thyroid cancer cell plays the important roles in post-surgical persistent , recurrent , and metastatic papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) .	
21400522_s1	This study is to investigate the expression of angiopoietin-1 ( Ang-1 ) , angiopoietin-2 ( Ang-2 ) , Tek/Tie-2 receptor , and vascular endothelial growth factors ( VEGF ) in normal , benign thyroid tissues and different stage of PTC .	
21400522_s2	We expect angiogenetic factors are important in the presentation of local-regional neck or distant metastases in PTC .	
21400522_s3	MATERIALS AND RESULTS A total of 101 tissues from the subjects underwent thyroidectomy were enrolled in the study .	
21400522_s4	There were 22 control and 79 thyroid cancer patients in different TNM stagings were collected .	
21400522_s5	Ang-1 illustrated highest mean immunostaining score in metastatic group .	
21400522_s6	Comparing with normal and benign thyroid tissues , thyroid cancer tissues illustrated significantly high expression of three angiogenetic factors and Tie-2 receptor .	
21400522_s7	Of the PTC , significantly high expression of three angiogenetic factors and Tie-2 receptor were illustrated in recurrent cases .	
21400522_s8	VEGF showed statistical difference in disease-free cancer mortality , and recurrent groups .	
21400522_s9	CONCLUSIONS Immunochemical staining illustrated VEGF , Ang-1 , Ang-2 expression in PTC tissues related to clinical staging ; however , we need more information concerning these factors with long-term follow-up results .	inducing angiogenesis
21569197_s0	The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug tepoxalin on canine tumour cell growth and describe the changes associated with tepoxalin treatment .	
21569197_s1	In vitro experiments were performed to assess tepoxalin-associated alterations in tumour cell growth .	
21569197_s2	Clinically achievable tepoxalin concentrations did not significantly alter tumour cell growth in vitro .	
21569197_s3	Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) production and hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± dose-dependently increased in vitro in the presence of tepoxalin .	inducing angiogenesis
21569197_s4	A canine osteosarcoma xenograft was used to determine in vivo effects of tepoxalin on tumour growth and angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
21569197_s5	Despite increased VEGF in vitro , there was a significant growth delay associated with tepoxalin treatment .	inducing angiogenesis
21569197_s6	Normal dogs were administered tepoxalin to assess effects on systemic VEGF production , but not found to have significantly increased VEGF .	inducing angiogenesis
21569197_s7	These data suggest that tepoxalin may moderately inhibit tumour growth and may be administered as an analgesic to tumour-bearing dogs .	
21850397_s0	The type I insulin-like growth factor receptor ( IGF1R ) contributes to cancer cell biology .	
21850397_s1	Disruption of IGF1R signaling alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents has emerged as a new therapeutic strategy .	
21850397_s2	Our laboratory has shown that sequential treatment with doxorubicin ( DOX ) and anti-IGF1R antibodies significantly enhanced the response to chemotherapy .	
21850397_s3	In this study , we examined whether inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of this receptor family would also enhance chemotherapy response .	
21850397_s4	Cis-3-[3-(4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)-cyclobutyl]-1-(2-phenyl-quinolin-7-yl)-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazin-8-ylamine ( PQIP ) inhibited IGF1R and insulin receptor ( InsR ) kinase activity and downstream activation of ERK1/2 and Akt in MCF-7 and LCC6 cancer cells .	
21850397_s5	PQIP inhibited both monolayer growth and anchorage-independent growth in a dose-dependent manner .	
21850397_s6	PQIP did not induce apoptosis , but rather , PQIP treatment was associated with an increase in autophagy .	resisting cell death
21850397_s7	We examined whether sequential or combination therapy of PQIP with DOX could enhance growth inhibition .	
21850397_s8	PQIP treatment together with DOX or DOX followed by PQIP significantly inhibited anchorage-independent growth in MCF-7 and LCC6 cells compared to single agent alone .	
21850397_s9	In contrast , pre-treatment with PQIP followed by DOX did not enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX in vitro .	
21850397_s10	Furthermore , OSI-906 , a PQIP derivative , inhibited IGF-I signaling in LCC6 xenograft tumors in vivo .	
21850397_s11	When given once a week , simultaneous administration of OSI-906 and DOX significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of DOX .	
21850397_s12	In summary , these results suggest that timing and duration of the IGF1R/InsR tyrosine kinase inhibitors with chemotherapeutic agents should be evaluated in clinical trials .	
21850397_s13	Long-term disruption of IGF1R/InsR may not be necessary when combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy .	
21893193_s0	Programmed cell death 6 ( PDCD6 ) was originally found as a pro-apoptotic protein , but its molecular mechanism is not well understood .	
21893193_s1	In this study , we have attempted to investigate the effects of PDCD6 on the inhibition of angiogenesis-mediated cell growth as a novel anti-angiogenic protein .	
21893193_s2	Purified recombinant human PDCD6 inhibited cell migration in a concentration-time-dependent manner .	
21893193_s3	We also found that overexpressed PDCD6 suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-induced proliferation , invasion , and capillary-like structure tube formation in vitro .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
21893193_s4	PDCD6 suppressed phosphorylation of signaling regulators downstream from PI3K , including Akt , mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) , glycogen synthase kinase-3Î²(GSK-3Î²) , ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( p70S6K ) , and also decreased cyclin D1 expression .	sustaining proliferative signaling
21893193_s5	We found binding PDCD6 to VEGFR-2 , a key player in the PI3K/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway .	
21893193_s6	Taken together , these data suggest that PDCD6 plays a significant role in modulating cellular angiogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
22245120_s0	Hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) is an organochlorine pesticide that acts as an endocrine disruptor in humans and rodents .	
22245120_s1	The development of breast cancer strongly depends on endocrine conditions modulated by environmental factors .	
22245120_s2	We have demonstrated that HCB is a tumor co-carcinogen in rats and an inducer of proliferation in MCF-7 cells , in an estrogen receptor Î± ( ERÎ±)-dependent manner , and of migration in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line .	
22245120_s3	In the present study , we examined HCB effect on c-Src/human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER1 ) and ERÎ± signaling pathways in mammary glands and in N-nitroso-N-methylurea ( NMU)-induced mammary tumors in rats .	
22245120_s4	Furthermore , we evaluated histopathological changes and serum hormone levels .	
22245120_s5	Rats were separated into four groups : control , HCB ( 100 mg/kg b.w. ) , NMU ( 50 mg/kg b.w. ) and NMU-HCB .	
22245120_s6	Our data show that HCB increases c-Src and HER1 activation , c-Src/HER1 association , and Y699-STAT5b and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in mammary glands .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22245120_s7	HCB also enhances Y537-ERÎ± phosphorylation and ERÎ±/c-Src physical interaction .	
22245120_s8	In tumors , HCB also induces c-Src and HER1 activation , c-Src/HER1 association , as well as T308-Akt and Y699-STAT5b phosphorylation .	
22245120_s9	In addition , the pesticide increases ERÎ± protein content and decreases p-Y537-ERÎ± levels and ERÎ±/c-Src association in tumors .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22245120_s10	HCB increases serum 17-beta estradiol and prolactin contents and decreases progesterone , FSH and LH levels in rats without tumors , while the opposite effect was observed in rats with tumors .	
22245120_s11	Taken together , our results indicate that HCB induces an estrogenic effect in mammary gland , increasing c-Src/HER1 and ERÎ± signaling pathways .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22245120_s12	HCB stimulates c-Src/HER1 pathway , but decreases ERÎ± activity in tumors , appearing to shift them towards a higher malignancy phenotype .	
22421439_s0	Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) is an important inflammatory cytokine and induces many cellular responses , including inflammation , cell proliferation , apoptosis , and necrosis .	
22421439_s1	It is known that receptor interacting protein ( RIP ) kinases , RIP1 and RIP3 , are key effectors of TNF-induced necrosis , but little is known about how these two RIP kinases mediate this process , although reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation and JNK activation have been suggested to be two downstream events of RIP kinases .	
22421439_s2	Here we report the identification of mixed lineage kinase domain-like , MLKL , as a key RIP3 downstream component of TNF-induced necrosis .	
22421439_s3	Through screening a kinase/phosphatase shRNA library in human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells , we found that knockdown of MLKL blocked TNF-induced necrosis .	resisting cell death
22421439_s4	Our data suggest that MLKL functions downstream of RIP1 and RIP3 and is recruited to the necrosome through its interaction with RIP3 .	
22421439_s5	Finally , we found that MLKL is required for the generation of ROS and the late-phase activation of JNK during TNF-induced necrosis .	
22421439_s6	However , because these two events are not involved in TNF-induced necrosis in HT-29 cells , the target of MLKL during TNF-induced necrosis remains elusive .	
22421439_s7	Taken together , our study suggests that MLKL is a key RIP3 downstream component of TNF-induced necrotic cell death .	
22511934_s0	The Salmonella type III secretion system ( T3SS ) efficiently translocates heterologous proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells .	
22511934_s1	This leads to an antigen-specific CD8 T-cell induction in mice orally immunized with recombinant Salmonella .	
22511934_s2	Recently , we have used Salmonella's T3SS as a prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against a murine fibrosarcoma .	
22511934_s3	In this study , we constructed a recombinant Salmonella strain translocating the immunogenic H-2D(b)-specific CD8 T-cell epitope VILTNPISM ( KDR2 ) from the murine vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) .	
22511934_s4	VEGFR2 is a member of the tyrosine protein kinase family and is upregulated on proliferating endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature .	
22511934_s5	After single orogastric vaccination , we detected significant numbers of KDR2-tetramer-positive CD8 T cells in the spleens of immunized mice .	
22511934_s6	The efficacy of these cytotoxic T cells was evaluated in a prophylactic setting to protect mice from challenges with B16F10 melanoma cells in a flank tumor model , and to reduce dissemination of spontaneous pulmonary melanoma metastases .	
22511934_s7	Vaccinated mice revealed a reduction of angiogenesis by 62% in the solid tumor and consequently a significant decrease of tumor growth as compared to non-immunized mice .	inducing angiogenesis
22511934_s8	Moreover , in the lung metastasis model , immunization with recombinant Salmonella resulted in a reduction of the metastatic melanoma burden by approximately 60% .	activating invasion and metastasis
22520577_s0	BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death throughout the world , and the risk to develop this malignant disease seems to be associated with long-term cigarette smoking .	
22520577_s1	Nicotine , one of the major components of cigarette smoking , can stimulate cell proliferation and suppress apoptosis both in normal cells and in several human cancer cell lines derived from various organs .	
22520577_s2	However , although nicotine appears to have a role in stimulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells , there is no information on its role in inhibiting apoptosis in these cells .	
22520577_s3	MATERIALS AND METHODS Human colorectal cancer cell lines Caco-2 and HCT-8 were treated with 1 Î¼M nicotine alone or in combination with 1 Î¼M Î±-BTX in complete or in serum free medium .	
22520577_s4	Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined by cell count performed with a cell counter and by cytofluorimetric assay respectively .	
22520577_s5	PI3K/Akt and PKC/ERK1/2 pathways , survivin , and P-Bcl2 ( Ser70 ) were investigated by Western blot analysis .	
22520577_s6	RESULTS Nicotine induced an increase in cell proliferation and a decrease of apoptosis in Caco-2 and HCT-8 cells .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22520577_s7	Both cell growth and apoptosis appear to be mediated by Î±7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors , since treatment with Î±-Bungarotoxin inhibited these processes .	
22520577_s8	Nicotine induced a statistically significant increase in the expression of PI3K and in P-Akt/Akt ratio as well as in the expression of PKC , ERK1/2 , survivin , and P-Bcl2 ( Ser70 ) in both cell lines .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22520577_s9	CONCLUSIONS Nicotine , contained in cigarette smoking , could participate in colon cancer development and progression by stimulating cell proliferation and suppressing physiological apoptosis .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22580046_s0	Oxidative stress is the main etiological factor behind the pathogenesis of various diseases including inflammation , cancer , cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders .	
22580046_s1	Due to the spin trapping abilities and various pharmacological properties of nitrones , their application as therapeutic agent has been gaining attention .	
22580046_s2	Though the antioxidant properties of the nitrones are well known , the mechanism by which they modulate the cellular defense machinery against oxidative stress is not well investigated and requires further elucidation .	
22580046_s3	Here , we have investigated the mechanisms of cytoprotection of the nitrone spin traps against oxidative stress in bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAEC ) .	
22580046_s4	Cytoprotective properties of both the cyclic nitrone 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide ( DMPO ) and linear nitrone Î±-phenyl N-tert-butyl nitrone ( PBN ) against HâOâ-induced cytotoxicity were investigated .	
22580046_s5	Preincubation of BAEC with PBN or DMPO resulted in the inhibition of HâOâ-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis .	resisting cell death
22580046_s6	Nitrone-treatment resulted in the induction and restoration of phase II antioxidant enzymes via nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf-2 ) in oxidatively-challenged cells .	
22580046_s7	Furthermore , the nitrones were found to inhibit the mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent activation of caspase-3 induced by HâOâ .	
22580046_s8	Significant down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins p53 and Bax , and up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and p-Bad were observed when the cells were preincubated with the nitrones prior to HâOâ-treatment .	
22580046_s9	It was also observed that Nrf-2 silencing completely abolished the protective effects of nitrones .	
22580046_s10	Hence , these findings suggest that nitrones confer protection to the endothelial cells against oxidative stress by modulating phase II antioxidant enzymes and subsequently inhibiting mitochondria-dependent apoptotic cascade .	
22590627_s0	Contact-inhibition ubiquitously exists in non-transformed cells and explains the poor regenerative capacity of in vivo human retinal pigment epithelial cells ( RPE ) during aging , injury and diseases .	
22590627_s1	RPE injury or degeneration may unlock mitotic block mediated by contact inhibition but may also promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) contributing to retinal blindness .	
22590627_s2	Herein , we confirmed that EMT ensued in post-confluent ARPE-19 cells when contact inhibition was disrupted with EGTA followed by addition of EGF and FGF-2 because of activation of canonical Wnt and Smad/ZEB signaling .	activating invasion and metastasis,evading growth suppressors
22590627_s3	In contrast , knockdown of p120-catenin ( p120 ) unlocked such mitotic block by activating p120/Kaiso , but not activating canonical Wnt and Smad/ZEB signaling , thus avoiding EMT .	
22590627_s4	Nuclear BrdU labeling was correlated with nuclear release of Kaiso through p120 nuclear translocation , which was associated with activation of RhoA-ROCK signaling , destabilization of microtubules .	
22590627_s5	Prolonged p120 siRNA knockdown followed by withdrawal further expanded RPE into more compact monolayers with a normal phenotype and a higher density .	
22590627_s6	This new strategy based on selective activation of p120/Kaiso but not Wnt/β-catenin signaling obviates the need of using single cells and the risk of EMT , and may be deployed to engineer surgical grafts containing RPE and other tissues .	
22639908_s0	BACKGROUND The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase is aberrantly activated in many solid tumors .	
22639908_s1	In a prior study we showed that prostate cancer PC-3 cells exhibit constitutively activated c-Met without exogenous hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) ; however whether this characteristic is due to an endogenous HGF/c-Met autocrine loop remains controversial .	
22639908_s2	In the current study we examined the response of PC-3 cells to an anti-HGF neutralizing antibody or a small molecule Met kinase inhibitor ( BMS-777607 ) .	
22639908_s3	METHODS Cell scattering was tested by monitoring cell morphology after HGF stimulation .	
22639908_s4	Cell migration was examined by both " wound-healing " and transwell assasy and invasion was detected by Matrigel-coated transwell assay .	
22639908_s5	Proliferation , survival and anoikis were determined by MTT , colony formation and trypan blue exclusion assay , respectively .	
22639908_s6	Gene and protein expression were assessed by real-time PCR and Western blot , respectively .	
22639908_s7	RESULTS Although HGF mRNA could be detected in PC-3 cells , the molecular weight of secreted " HGF " protein was inconsistent with the functional recombinant HGF .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22639908_s8	Furthermore , conditioned medium from PC-3 cell cultures was ineffective at triggering either motogenic behavior or c-Met signaling in DU145 , another prostate cancer cell line expressing c-Met but lacking basal c-Met activation .	
22639908_s9	PC-3 cells also were not responsive to the anti-HGF neutralizing antibody in experiments assessing proliferation , migration , or c-Met signaling .	
22639908_s10	BMS-777607 treatment with micromolar doses nonetheless led to significant inhibition of multiple PC-3 cell functions including proliferation , clonogenicity , migration and invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
22639908_s11	At the molecular level , BMS-777607 suppressed autophosphorylated c-Met and downstream c-Src and Akt pathways .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22639908_s12	CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the constitutive c-Met activation in PC-3 is independent of autocrine stimulation .	
22639908_s13	Because PC-3 cells were responsive to BMS-777607 but not the anti-HGF antibody , the findings also indicate that under circumstances where c-Met is constitutively hyperactive in the absence of functional HGF , targeting the c-Met receptor remains a viable therapeutic option to impede cancer progression .	
22722460_s0	BACKGROUND Metastatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the kidney is a rare malignant vascular tumor with a wide spectrum of behaviors .	
22722460_s1	CASE REPORT We present the case of a 53-year-old male patient with tumor metastases which developed after radical nephrectomy .	
22722460_s2	We describe the immunohistochemistry profile of the tumor and the successful long-term results of treatment with sunitinib , a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor .	
22722460_s3	Also , we discuss the rationale for using this type of medication based on immunohistochemistry results .	
22722460_s4	CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge , this is the first reported case of metastatic renal epithelioid hemangioendothelioma treated successfully with sunitinib .	activating invasion and metastasis
22800968_s0	Fagonia indica is a small spiny shrub of great ethnopharmacological importance in folk medicine .	
22800968_s1	The aqueous decoction of aerial parts is a popular remedy against various skin lesions , including cancer .	
22800968_s2	We used a biological activity-guided fractionation approach to isolate the most potent fraction of the crude extract on three cancer cell lines : MCF-7 oestrogen-dependent breast cancer , MDA-MB-468 oestrogen-independent breast cancer , and Caco-2 colon cancer cells .	
22800968_s3	A series of chromatographic and spectroscopic procedures were utilised on the EtOAc fraction , which resulted in the isolation of a new steroidal saponin glycoside .	
22800968_s4	The cytotoxic activity of the saponin glycoside was determined in cancer cells using the MTT and neutral red uptake assays .	
22800968_s5	After 24h treatment , the observed IC(50) values of the saponin glycoside were 12.5 Î¼M on MDA-MB-468 and Caco-2 cells , but 100 Î¼M on MCF-7 cells .	
22800968_s6	Several lines of evidence : PARP cleavage , caspase-3 cleavage , DNA ladder assays , and reversal of growth inhibition with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk , suggested stimulation of apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and Caco-2 cells , but not in MCF-7 cells , which do not express caspase-3 .	resisting cell death
22800968_s7	The haemolytic activity of the saponin glycoside was confirmed in sheep red blood cells , with cell lysis observed at &gt;100 Î¼M , suggesting that , at this concentration , the saponin glycoside caused necrosis through cell lysis in MCF-7 cells .	resisting cell death
22800968_s8	Using the DNA ladder assay , the saponin glycoside ( 12.5 Î¼M ) was not toxic to HUVEC ( human umbilical vein endothelial cells ) or U937 cells , indicating some selectivity between malignant and normal cells .	
22800968_s9	We conclude that the steroidal saponin glycoside isolated from F. indica is able to induce apoptosis or necrosis in cancer cells depending on the cell type .	resisting cell death
22870112_s0	Overexpression of growth factors and/or their receptors is a common event in malignancy and provides the underlying mechanisms for one of the hallmarks of cancer , uncontrolled proliferation .	
22870112_s1	Mounting evidence suggests that IGF-1 is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different types of human cancer such as colon , breast , prostate and lung .	
22870112_s2	However , only a few studies have investigated the association between IGF-1 levels and childhood cancer risk .	
22870112_s3	We aimed to compare the IGF-1 serum level in children with de novo malignancies to healthy children , and to assess its relationship with cancer type , stage , metastasis and different disease characteristics .	
22870112_s4	The study was carried out on 100 children ; 50 children with de novo malignancies and 50 healthy children of matched age and gender as a control group .	
22870112_s5	The patients were subjected to a routine work-up for their cancers according to our local standards .	
22870112_s6	Estimation of the serum level of IGF-1 was carried out in the two groups using ELISA .	
22870112_s7	Our results showed that children with cancer had significantly higher levels of IGF-1 than healthy controls of the same age and gender .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22870112_s8	No association was found between IGF-1 and tumor type , stage , metastasis and other disease characteristics .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22870112_s9	In conclusion , the IGF-1 serum level is an important indicator of risk for the most prevalent forms of childhood cancer .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22870112_s10	It may be used to identify children at the highest risk for these cancers and aid in determing who may benefit most from preventive strategies .	
22870112_s11	Given the small number of children in our study , studies with larger populations are required to confirm these results .	
22873102_s0	OBJECTIVES To investigate the expression of TLR-4 ( toll-like receptor ) on human cervical cancer and find the biological function of the TLR-4 signal system .	
22873102_s1	METHODS The immunohistochemistry method was performed to study the protein expression and distribution of TLR-4 .	
22873102_s2	The viability of HeLa cells was determined by cell viability assay .	
22873102_s3	Cell proliferation was detected by FCM , ELISA and Western blot were used to observe the gene and protein expression of IL-6 and TGF-beta1 in Hela cell lines .	
22873102_s4	RESULTS TLR-4 was over-expressed in cervix cancer , and its activation by LPS promotes proliferation and anti-apoptosis in Hela cells in vitro .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
22873102_s5	Moreover the cell line proliferation increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22873102_s6	The production of IL-6 and TGF-beta1 were promoted through the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway .	
22876119_s0	PURPOSE To characterize the clinical features of a Chinese Uygur pedigree with primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) and to identify mutations in two candidate genes , trabecular meshwork inducible glucocorticoid response ( MYOC/TIGR ) and human dioxin-inducible cytochrome P450 ( CYP1B1 ) .	
22876119_s1	METHODS Twenty one members from a Chinese Uygur family of four generations were included in the study .	
22876119_s2	All participants underwent complete ophthalmologic examinations .	
22876119_s3	Five were diagnosed as POAG , four as glaucoma suspects , and the rest were asymptomatic .	
22876119_s4	Molecular genetic analysis was performed on all subjects included in the study .	
22876119_s5	All exons of CYP1B1 and MYOC were amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , sequenced and compared with a reference database .	
22876119_s6	The variations detected were evaluated in available family members as well as 102 normal controls .	
22876119_s7	Possible changes in structure and function of the protein induced by amino acid variance were predicted by bioinformatics analysis .	
22876119_s8	RESULTS Elevated intraocular pressure and late-stage glaucomatous cupping of the optic disc were found in five patients of this family .	
22876119_s9	A novel heterozygous missense mutation c.1151 A&gt;G in exon 3 of MYOC was found in all five patients diagnosed as POAG and four glaucoma suspects , but not in the rest of the family members and 102 normal controls .	genomic instability and mutation
22876119_s10	This mutation caused an amino acid substitution of aspartic acid to glycine at position 384 ( p .	
22876119_s11	D384G ) of the MYOC protein .	
22876119_s12	This substitution may cause structural and functional changes of the protein based on bioinformatics analysis .	
22876119_s13	No mutations were found in CYP1B1 .	genomic instability and mutation
22876119_s14	CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that the novel mutation D384G of MYOC is likely responsible for the pathogenesis of POAG in this pedigree .	genomic instability and mutation
22899882_s0	Altered p53 protein is prevalently associated with the pathologic class of triple-negative breast cancers and loss of p53 function has recently been linked to the induction of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and acquisition of stemness properties .	
22899882_s1	We explored the association between TP53 mutational status and expression of some genes involved in the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway ( the most potent EMT inducer ) and in two early EMT associated events : loss of cell polarity and acquisition of stemness-associated features .	
22899882_s2	We used a publicly accessible microarray dataset consisting of 251 p53-sequenced primary breast cancers .	
22899882_s3	Statistical analysis indicated that mutant p53 tumors ( especially those harboring a severe mutation ) were consistent with the aggressive class of triple-negative cancers and that , differently from cell cultures , surgical tumors underexpressed some TGF-β related transcription factors known as involved in EMT ( ID1 , ID4 , SMAD3 , SMAD4 , SMAD5 , ZEB1 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation,sustaining proliferative signaling
22899882_s4	These unexpected findings suggest an interesting relationship between p53 mutation , mammary cell dedifferentiation , and the concomitant acquisition of stemlike properties ( as indicated by the overexpression of PROM1 and NOTCH1 genes ) , which improve tumor cells aggressiveness as indicated by the overexpression of genes associated with cell proliferation ( CDK4 , CDK6 , MKI67 ) and migration ( CXCR4 , MMP1 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,genomic instability and mutation
22911891_s0	Mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene are found in more than 80% of colorectal cancer ( CRC ) patients .	
22911891_s1	The nuclear transcription factor Nrf2 plays a central role in the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation .	
22911891_s2	Previously , we have shown that chronic inflammation in Nrf2(-/-) ( Nrf2 knockout ; KO ) mice resulted in higher expression of inflammatory markers and cytokines , coupled with higher inflammatory damage to the colonic crypt cells , as compared to the Nrf2(+/+) ( wild type ; WT ) mice .	
22911891_s3	Induction of mutation in the colon by administration of carcinogen , AOM prior to DSS-induced inflammation resulted in higher tumor incidence and numbers in Nrf2KO mice .	
22911891_s4	These results indicate that Nrf2-dependent inhibition of inflammation appears to be critical in inhibiting mutation-initiated colorectal carcinogenesis .	
22911891_s5	In this study , we aim to investigate if loss of Nrf2 would dose-dependently promote intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(min/+) mice .	
22911891_s6	To demonstrate the in vivo mechanisms , we constructed both Apc mutated and Nrf2 deficient strain Apc(min/+) mice with C57BL/6 Nrf2KO mice to obtain F1 , Apc(min/+) ;Nrf2(+/-) and F2 , Apc(min/+) ;Nrf2(-/-) mice .	
22911891_s7	Nrf2KO decreased the protein expression of antioxidant enzyme NQO1 in Apc(min/+) .	
22911891_s8	In contrast , Nrf2KO enhanced the expression of inflammatory markers such as COX-2 , cPLA , LTB(4) in Apc(min/+) .	tumor promoting inflammation
22911891_s9	Finally , Nrf2KO resulted in higher level of PCNA and c-Myc expression in intestinal tissue , indicating the deficiency of Nrf2 promotes proliferation of intestinal crypt cells in Apc(min/+) .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22911891_s10	Taken together , our results suggest that Nrf2KO attenuates anti-oxidative stress pathway , induces inflammation , and increases proliferative potential in the intestinal crypts leading to enhanced intestinal carcinogenesis and adenomas in Apc(min/+) .

22919357_s0	To evaluate a radioprotective effect of sodium n-propyl thiosulfate ( NPTS ) and sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate ( 2PTS ) derived from onions and garlic , respectively , rat hepatoma H4IIE cells and mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were preincubated with each of these compounds for 48 hours at 37°C before receiving 10 Gy of X-ray irradiation .	
22919357_s1	Cell damage caused by the irradiation was quantified as comet tail moment , which represents the degree of DNA damage .	
22919357_s2	X-ray-induced DNA damage was significantly decreased in both H4IIE and L5178Y cells by micromolar concentrations of NPTS and 2PTS compared with the control without the compounds .	genomic instability and mutation
22919357_s3	The protective effect was more potent with 2PTS than NPTS .	
22919357_s4	Onions and garlic have antiradiation potential .	
22933705_s0	In lung cancer , platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± ( PDGFRÎ± ) is expressed frequently by tumor-associated stromal cells and by cancer cells in a subset of tumors .	
22933705_s1	We sought to determine the effect of targeting stromal PDGFRÎ± in preclinical lung tumor xenograft models ( human tumor , mouse stroma ) .	
22933705_s2	Effects of anti-human ( IMC-3G3 ) and anti-mouse ( 1E10 ) PDGFRÎ± monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) on proliferation and PDGFRÎ± signaling were evaluated in lung cancer cell lines and mouse fibroblasts .	
22933705_s3	Therapy studies were conducted using established PDGFRÎ±-positive H1703 cells and PDGFRÎ±-negative Calu-6 , H1993 , and A549 subcutaneous tumors in immunocompromised mice treated with vehicle , anti-PDGFRÎ± mAbs , chemotherapy , or combination therapy .	
22933705_s4	Tumors were analyzed for growth and levels of growth factors .	
22933705_s5	IMC-3G3 inhibited PDGFRÎ± activation and the growth of H1703 cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo , but had no effect on PDGFRÎ±-negative cell lines or mouse fibroblasts. 1E10 inhibited growth and PDGFRÎ± activation of mouse fibroblasts , but had no effect on human cancer cell lines in vitro .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22933705_s6	In vivo , 1E10-targeted inhibition of murine PDGFRÎ± reduced tumor growth as single-agent therapy in Calu-6 cells and enhanced the effect of chemotherapy in xenografts derived from A549 cells .	
22933705_s7	We also identified that low expression cancer cell expression of VEGF-A and elevated expression of PDGF-AA were associated with response to stromal PDGFRÎ± targeting .	
22933705_s8	We conclude that stromal PDGFRÎ± inhibition represents a means for enhancing control of lung cancer growth in some cases , independent of tumor cell PDGFRÎ± expression .	
22935614_s0	Regulator of Cullins-1 ( ROC1 ) or RING box protein-1 ( RBX1 ) is an essential RING component of Cullin-RING ligase ( CRL ) .	
22935614_s1	Our previous studies showed that ROC1 is required for the growth of several cancer cell lines while ROC1 siRNA silencing inactivates CRL , leading to cell cycle arrest , cell senescence and/or apoptosis .	
22935614_s2	However , it is completely unknown whether ROC1 knockdown triggers autophagic response by inactivating CRL .	
22935614_s3	Moreover , the role of ROC1 in liver cancer remains elusive .	
22935614_s4	In this study , we reported that ROC1 knockdown significantly inhibited the growth of liver cancer cells by sequentially and independently inducing autophagy and p21-dependent cell senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
22935614_s5	Mechanism analysis revealed that ROC1 silencing triggered autophagy by inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) activity due to accumulation of mTOR-inhibitory protein Deptor , a substrate of CRL .	resisting cell death
22935614_s6	Consistently , Deptor knockdown significantly blocked autophagy response upon ROC1 silencing .	
22935614_s7	Biologically , autophagy response upon ROC1 silencing was a survival signal , and blockage of autophagy pathway sensitized cancer cells to apoptosis .	resisting cell death
22935614_s8	Finally , we demonstrated that ROC1 was overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinomas , which is associated with poor prognosis of liver cancer patients .	
22935614_s9	These findings suggest that ROC1 is an appealing drug target for liver cancer and provide a proof-of-concept evidence for a novel drug combination of ROC1 inhibitor and an autophagy inhibitor for effective treatment of liver cancer by enhancing apoptosis.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication , 31 August 2012 ; doi:10.1038/cdd.2012.113 .	
22939316_s0	Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia generally have a poor prognosis and a highly heterogeneous clinical outcome .	
22939316_s1	Prognostic indicators are required for and aid in patient stratification .	
22939316_s2	However , the prognostic value of genetic mutations and immunophenotypic features in elderly normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia , the largest cytogenetic risk group , remains unclear .	
22939316_s3	We investigated the genetic mutations NPM1 , FLT3-ITD , and FLT3-TKD and expression of the membrane antigens CD7 , CD15 , CD34 , and CD56 in 144 elderly patients with de novo normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia to retrospectively analyze the prognostic and clinical relevance of these parameters .	
22939316_s4	CD7 , CD15 , CD34 , and CD56 were expressed in 24% , 47% , 52% , and 15% of patients , respectively .	
22939316_s5	NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations were detected in 51% and 17% of patients , respectively .	genomic instability and mutation
22939316_s6	Complete remission was obtained in 94 patients ( 65% ) , and the median overall survival was 16.5 months .	
22939316_s7	Univariate analysis detected 5 markers with prognostic relevance : high leukocyte count , FLT3-ITD mutations , NPM1 mutations , CD34 expression , and CD56 expression in acute myeloid leukemia blasts .	genomic instability and mutation
22939316_s8	In multivariate analysis , patients with NPM1 predicted a higher complete remission ( CR ) rate ( P = .016 ) , longer event-free survival ( P = .008 ) , and longer overall survival ( P = .049 ) .	
22939316_s9	FLT3-ITD mutations predicted a shorter event-free survival ( P = .002 ) and shorter overall survival ( P &lt ; .001 ) .	genomic instability and mutation
22939316_s10	CD56 remained an independent predictor for lower CR rate ( P = .021 ) and shorter event-free survival ( P = .002 ) .	
22939316_s11	Our data highlight the prognostic importance of both genetic and immunophenotypic characteristics in this population of elderly patients with newly diagnosed normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia .	
22939316_s12	By combining genetic and immunophenotypic markers , we can divide patients into distinct prognostic groups with important implications for prognostic stratification and risk-adapted therapy .	
22940742_s0	Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new blood vessels form existing vessels surrounding a tumor .	
22940742_s1	The process of angiogenesis is an important step for tumor growth and metastasis , as is inflammation .	
22940742_s2	Thus , angiogenesis inhibitors that suppress inflammation have been studied as an anticancer treatment .	
22940742_s3	Recently , many research groups have investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of natural compounds since some have been demonstrated to have anticancer properties .	
22940742_s4	Among many natural compounds , we focused on betaine , which is known to suppress inflammation .	
22940742_s5	Betaine , trimethylglycine ( TMG ) , was first discovered in the juice of sugar beets and was later shown to be present in wheat , shellfish and spinach .	
22940742_s6	In Southeast Asia , betaine is used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of hepatic disorders .	
22940742_s7	Here , we report the anti-angiogenic action of betaine .	inducing angiogenesis
22940742_s8	Betaine inhibited invitro angiogenic cascade , tube formation , migration and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
22940742_s9	Betaine also inhibited invivo angiogenesis in the mouse Matrigel plug assay .	inducing angiogenesis
22940742_s10	The mRNA expression levels of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2 ) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in HUVECs were decreased by betaine treatment .	sustaining proliferative signaling
22940742_s11	In addition , betaine suppressed NF-ÎºB and Akt activation .	
22969849_s0	Liver cancer ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignancy of all cancers worldwide .	
22969849_s1	According to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine , liver Yin deficiency is a common clinical syndrome of liver cancer , and tonifying liver Yin is a common treatment method for liver cancer .	
22969849_s2	However , no hepatocarcinoma-specific liver Yin tonifying formula has yet been established .	
22969849_s3	In the present study , we established a liver cancer-specific combination of herbs , which we term liver Yin tonifying formula ( LYTF ) .	
22969849_s4	We found that LYTF inhibits the proliferation of Bel-7402 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner .	
22969849_s5	LYTF induces apoptosis in Bel-7402 cells , which is accompanied by activation of caspases-8 , -9 and -3 .	resisting cell death
22969849_s6	Pan-caspase blocking completely abrogates LYTF-induced apoptosis and partially abrogates LYTF-induced proliferation inhibition .	resisting cell death
22969849_s7	LYTF also induces cell senescence , as indicated by a large and flattened morphology , senescence-activated Î²-galactosidase-positive staining and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest , accompanied by the up-regulation of p16 and p21 and the down-regulation of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation .	enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors
22969849_s8	These findings suggest that LYTF is effective in inhibiting the growth and survival of hepatocarcinoma cells through the induction of apoptosis and cell senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
22969849_s9	Our study also provides insight into traditional Chinese medicine methods used for the treatment of liver cancer .	
22970226_s0	Despite insights into the molecular pathways regulating hypoxia-induced gene expression , it is not known which cell types accomplish oxygen sensing during neo-vasculogenesis .	
22970226_s1	We have developed a humanized mouse model of endothelial and mesenchymal progenitor co-transplantation to delineate the cellular compartments responsible for hypoxia response during vasculogenesis .	
22970226_s2	Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells ( MSPCs ) accumulated nuclear hypoxia-inducible transcription factor ( HIF)-1Î± earlier and more sensitively than endothelial colony forming progenitor cells ( ECFCs ) in vitro and in vivo .	
22970226_s3	Hypoxic ECFCs showed reduced function in vitro and underwent apoptosis within 24h in vivo when used without MSPCs .	resisting cell death
22970226_s4	Surprisingly , only in MSPCs did pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of HIF-1Î± abrogate neo-vasculogenesis .	inducing angiogenesis
22970226_s5	HIF deletion in ECFCs caused no effect .	
22970226_s6	ECFCs could be rescued from hypoxia-induced apoptosis by HIF-competent MSPCs resulting in the formation of patent perfused human vessels .	resisting cell death
22970226_s7	Several angiogenic factors need to act in concert to partially substitute mesenchymal HIF-deficiency .	inducing angiogenesis
22970226_s8	Results demonstrate that ECFCs require HIF-competent vessel wall progenitors to initiate vasculogenesis in vivo and to bypass hypoxia-induced apoptosis .	inducing angiogenesis,resisting cell death
22970226_s9	We describe a novel mechanistic role of MSPCs as oxygen sensors promoting vasculogenesis thus underscoring their importance for the development of advanced cellular therapies .	
22984881_s0	Exosomes are small-membrane vesicles secreted by hematopoietic and malignant epithelial cells as well as trophoblasts .	
22984881_s1	The composition of cancerous exosomes has been proven to play pivotal roles in the maintenance of the microenvironment that is beneficial for the progression of cancer , such as Fas-ligand-triggered lymphocyte apoptosis .	
22984881_s2	We supposed that the immunosuppressive effect of cancerous exosomes might be helpful in the treatment of diseases characterized by overactivation of the immune system and subsequent tissue injury .	
22984881_s3	The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of tumor-derived exosomes in the mice model of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)-induced inflammation .	
22984881_s4	Tetrazolium ( MTT ) and DNA electrophoresis were used to measure the cytotoxicity of exosomes on lymphocytes .	
22984881_s5	Pathologic observation of tissue sections , serologic analysis of aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ( AST/ALT ) , and urinary analysis of protein were used to assess the protection effect of exosomes in LPS-induced multiorgan damage .	
22984881_s6	In vitro outcomes of MTT and DNA electrophoresis showed the cytotoxicity of exosomes on lymphocytes .	
22984881_s7	Together with the alleviation of organ damages evaluated by urine protein , serum AST/ALT , and pathologic analysis , we confirmed the possibility that pretreatment of mice with exosomes , produced by H22 hepatic tumor cells , resulted in protection against LPS-induced tissue damage , which is caused by overactivation of the immune system and inflammation response .	tumor promoting inflammation
22984881_s8	This therapeutic strategy will raise an interesting way to search new therapeutics in pairs of diseases with complementarities in etiology and pathology , namely , a strategy of taking advantage of the mutual complementarities between diseases .	
22995475_s0	ABSTRACT : INTRODUCTION : Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis , the primary cause of breast cancer morbidity and death .	
22995475_s1	Here we investigated the role of p21Cip1 ( p21 ) , a member of the core cell cycle machinery , in transforming growth factor-beta ( TGFÎ²)-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion .	
22995475_s2	METHODS : A mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model was used to assess the mammary tumor growth and local invasion .	
22995475_s3	The triple negative human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and its sub-progenies SCP2 and SCP25 , SUM159PT , SUM149PT , SUM229PE and SUM1315MO2 were treated with 5 ng/ml TGFÎ² and the protein expression levels were measured by Western blot .	
22995475_s4	Cell migration and invasion were examined using the scratch/wound healing and Transwell assay .	
22995475_s5	TGFÎ² transcriptional activity was measured by a TGFÎ²/Smad reporter construct ( CAGA12-luc ) using luciferase assay. q-PCR was used for assessing TGFÎ² downstream target genes .	
22995475_s6	The interactions among p21 , p/CAF and Smad3 were performed by co-immunoprecipitation .	
22995475_s7	In addition , Smad3 on DNA binding ability was measured by DNA immunoprecipitation using biotinylated Smad binding element DNA probes .	
22995475_s8	Finally , the association among active TGFÎ²/Smad signaling , p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors , 25 of which are lymph node positive .	
22995475_s9	RESULTS : We found p21 expression to correlate with poor overall and distant metastasis free survival in breast cancer patients .	activating invasion and metastasis
22995475_s10	Furthermore , using xenograft animal models and in vitro studies , we found p21 to be essential for tumor cell invasion .	activating invasion and metastasis
22995475_s11	The invasive effects of p21 were found to correlate with Smad3 , and p/CAF interaction downstream of TGFÎ². p21 and p/CAF regulates TGFÎ²-mediated transcription of pro-metastatic genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation , DNA binding and transcriptional activity .	
22995475_s12	In addition , we found that active TGFÎ²/Smad signaling correlates with high p21 and p/CAF expression levels and lymph node involvement using tissue microarrays from breast cancer patients .	
22995475_s13	CONCLUSIONS : Together these results highlight an important role for p21 and p/CAF in promoting breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level and may open new avenues for breast cancer therapy .	activating invasion and metastasis
23028051_s0	The complement system contributes to various immune and inflammatory diseases , including cancer .	
23028051_s1	In this study , we investigated the capacity of lung cancer cells to activate complement and characterized the consequences of complement activation on tumor progression .	
23028051_s2	We focused our study on the production and role of the anaphylatoxin C5a , a potent immune mediator generated after complement activation .	
23028051_s3	We first measured the capacity of lung cancer cell lines to deposit C5 and release C5a .	
23028051_s4	C5 deposition , after incubation with normal human serum , was higher in lung cancer cell lines than in nonmalignant bronchial epithelial cells .	
23028051_s5	Notably , lung malignant cells produced complement C5a even in the absence of serum .	
23028051_s6	We also found a significant increase of C5a in plasma from patients with non-small cell lung cancer , suggesting that the local production of C5a is followed by its systemic diffusion .	
23028051_s7	The contribution of C5a to lung cancer growth in vivo was evaluated in the Lewis lung cancer model .	
23028051_s8	Syngeneic tumors of 3LL cells grew slower in mice treated with an antagonist of the C5a receptor .	
23028051_s9	C5a did not modify 3LL cell proliferation in vitro but induced endothelial cell chemotaxis and blood-vessels formation .	inducing angiogenesis
23028051_s10	C5a also contributed to the immunosuppressive microenvironment required for tumor growth .	avoiding immune destruction
23028051_s11	In particular , blockade of C5a receptor significantly reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cells and immunomodulators ARG1 , CTLA-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , LAG3 , and PDL1 ( B7H1 ) .	
23028051_s12	In conclusion , lung cancer cells have the capacity to generate C5a , a molecule that creates a favorable tumor microenvironment for lung cancer progression .	
23029387_s0	BACKGROUND Cellular stress responses trigger signaling cascades that inhibit proliferation and protein translation to help alleviate the stress or if the stress cannot be overcome induce apoptosis .	
23029387_s1	In recent studies , we demonstrated the ability of lovastatin , an inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis , to induce the Integrated Stress Response as well as inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) activation .	
23029387_s2	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS In this study , we evaluated the effects of lovastatin on the activity of the LKB1/AMPK pathway that is activated upon cellular energy shortage and can interact with the above pathways .	
23029387_s3	In the squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) cell lines SCC9 and SCC25 , lovastatin treatment ( 1-25 ï¿½M , 24 hrs ) induced LKB1 and AMPK activation similar to metformin ( 1-10 mM , 24 hrs ) , a known inducer of this pathway .	
23029387_s4	Lovastatin treatment impaired mitochondrial function and also decreased cellular ADP/ATP ratios , common triggers of LKB1/AMPK activation .	
23029387_s5	The cytotoxic effects of lovastatin were attenuated in LKB1 null MEFs indicating a role for this pathway in regulating lovastatin-induced cytotoxicity .	
23029387_s6	Of clinical relevance , lovastatin induces synergistic cytotoxicity in combination with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23029387_s7	In LKB1 deficient ( A549 , HeLa ) and expressing ( SCC9 , SCC25 ) cell lines , metformin enhanced gefitinib cytotoxicity only in LKB1 expressing cell lines while both groups showed synergistic cytotoxic effects with lovastatin treatments .	
23029387_s8	Furthermore , the combination of lovastatin with gefitinib induced a potent apoptotic response without significant induction of autophagy that is often induced during metabolic stress inhibiting cell death .	resisting cell death
23029387_s9	CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE Thus , targeting multiple metabolic stress pathways including the LKB1/AMPK pathway enhances lovastatin's ability to synergize with gefitinib in SCC cells .	
23029447_s0	Complex interactions between effector T cells and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells ( Treg ) contribute to clinical outcomes in cancer , and autoimmune and infectious diseases .	
23029447_s1	Previous work showed that IL-12 reversed Treg-mediated suppression of CD4(+)Foxp3(-) T cell ( Tconv ) proliferation .	
23029447_s2	We and others have also shown that Tregs express T-bet and IFN-Î³ at sites of Th1 inflammation and that IL-12 induces IFN-Î³ production by Tregs in vitro .	
23029447_s3	To investigate whether loss of immunosuppression occurs when IFN-Î³ is expressed by Tregs we treated mouse lymphocyte cultures with IL-12 .	
23029447_s4	IFN-Î³ expression did not decrease the ability of Tregs to suppress Tconv proliferation .	
23029447_s5	Rather , IL-12 treatment decreased Treg frequency and Foxp3 levels in Tregs .	
23029447_s6	We further showed that IL-12 increased IL-2R expression on Tconv and CD8 T cells , diminished its expression on Tregs and decreased IL-2 production by Tconv and CD8 T cells .	avoiding immune destruction
23029447_s7	Together , these IL-12 mediated changes favored the outgrowth of non-Tregs .	
23029447_s8	Additionally , we showed that treatment with a second cytokine , IL-27 , decreased IL-2 expression without augmenting Tconv and CD8 T cell proliferation .	
23029447_s9	Notably , IL-27 only slightly modified levels of IL-2R on non-Treg T cells .	
23029447_s10	Together , these results show that IL-12 has multiple effects that modify the balance between Tregs and non-Tregs and support an important role for relative levels of IL-2R but not for IFN-Î³ expression in IL-12-mediated reversal of Treg immunosuppression .	avoiding immune destruction
23047035_s0	Human podoplanin is a type-1 transmembrane sialomucin-like glycoprotein that is involved in cell migration , tumor cell invasion and metastasis .	
23047035_s1	Our recent study of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) demonstrated that the degree of immunohistochemical expression of podoplanin was correlated with the severity of epithelial dysplasia and significantly associated with a poor pathologic grade of differentiation .	
23047035_s2	Furthermore , it has been reported that Src directly associates with the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in OSCC cells upon stimulation with EGF and phosphorylates Crk-associated substrate ( Cas ) , podoplanin acting downstream of Src and Cas to promote cell migration .	
23047035_s3	However , the molecular function of podoplanin remains unclear .	
23047035_s4	In this study we performed real-time RT-PCR , Western blotting and scratch assay using OSCC cell lines in order to clarify the molecular biological function of podoplanin expression associated with various growth factors including EGF and with the Src-Cas signaling pathway .	
23047035_s5	Podoplanin was found to have a marked influence on cancer cell migration and the expression of matrix metalloprotease-9 ( MMP-9 ) in the oral cavity upon stimulation with EGF .	activating invasion and metastasis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23047035_s6	Podoplanin promotes oral cancer cell migration , and the EGF-Src-Cas pathway is one of the possible mechanisms responsible for progression of cancer in the oral cavity .	activating invasion and metastasis
23069658_s0	Although prostate cancer ( CaP ) is the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumor in American men , the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of CaP remain largely unknown .	
23069658_s1	Recent studies have shown that downregulation of the microRNA miR-124 occurs in several types of human cancer , suggesting a tumor suppressive function of miR-124 .	
23069658_s2	Until now , however , it has been unclear whether miR-124 is associated with CaP .	
23069658_s3	In the present study , we completed a series of experiments to understand the functional role of miR-124 in CaP .	
23069658_s4	We detected the expression level of miR-124 in clinical CaP tissues , evaluated the influence of miR-124 on the growth of CaP cells and investigated the mechanism underlying the dysregulation of miR-124 .	
23069658_s5	We found that ( i ) miR-124 directly targets the androgen receptor ( AR ) and subsequently induces an upregulation of p53 ; ( ii ) miR-124 is significantly downregulated in malignant prostatic cells compared to benign cells , and DNA methylation causes the reduced expression of miR-124 ; and ( iii ) miR-124 can inhibit the growth of CaP cells in vitro and in vivo .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23069658_s6	Data from this study revealed that loss of miR-124 expression is a common event in CaP , which may contribute to the pathogenesis of CaP .	
23069658_s7	Our studies also suggest that miR-124 is a potential tumor suppressive gene in CaP , and restoration of miR-124 expression may represent a novel strategy for CaP therapy.Oncogene advance online publication , 15 October 2012 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.425 .	
23085979_s0	The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) contributes to the control of cell-to-cell communication , cell adhesion , migration or proliferation .	
23085979_s1	In the present study , we investigated the regulation of connexin43 ( Cx43 ) and Cx43-mediated gap junctional intercellular communication ( GJIC ) during the AhR-dependent disruption of contact inhibition in non-tumorigenic liver epithelial cells .	
23085979_s2	The contact inhibition of cell proliferation is a process restricting the cell division of confluent non-transformed cells , which is frequently abolished in cancer cells ; however , the mechanisms contributing to its disruption are still only partially understood .	
23085979_s3	Disruption of contact inhibition , which was induced by toxic AhR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in epithelial WB-F344 cells , reduced Cx43 protein levels , possibly via enhanced proteasomal degradation , significantly decreased the amount of gap junction plaques and downregulated GJIC , in an AhR-dependent manner .	evading growth suppressors
23085979_s4	Although both intracellular and membrane Cx43 pools were markedly reduced in cells released from contact inhibition by TCDD , siRNA-mediated Cx43 knock-down was not sufficient to stimulate proliferation in contact-inhibited cells .	evading growth suppressors
23085979_s5	Our data suggest that downregulation of Cx43/GJIC in non-transformed epithelial cells is an inherent part of disruption of contact inhibition , which occurs at the post-transcriptional level .	evading growth suppressors
23085979_s6	This process runs in parallel with alterations of other forms of cell-to-cell communication , thus suggesting that toxic AhR agonists may simultaneously abrogate contact inhibition and reduce GJIC , two essential mechanisms linked to deregulation of cell-to-cell communication during tumor promotion and progression .	evading growth suppressors
23098072_s0	Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) is a target for immune system stimulation during cancer immunotherapy and a cell-surface marker for pancreatic cancer .	
23098072_s1	To develop targeted agents for cancer imaging and therapy , we designed , synthesized , and characterized 13 novel , fully synthetic high affinity TLR2 agonists .	
23098072_s2	Analogue 10 had the highest agonist activity ( NF-ÎºB functional assay , EC(50) = 20 nM ) and binding affinity ( competitive binding assay , K(i) = 25 nM ) .	
23098072_s3	As an immune adjuvant , compound 10 stimulated the immune system in vivo by generation and persistence of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells indicating its potential use in cancer immunotherapy .	avoiding immune destruction
23098072_s4	After conjugation of near-infrared dye to 10 , agonist activity ( EC(50) = 34 nM ) and binding affinity ( K(i) = 11 nM ) were retained in 13 .	
23098072_s5	Fluorescence signal was present in TLR2 expressing pancreatic tumor xenografts 24 h after injection of 13 , while an excess of unlabeled ligand blocked 13 from binding to the tumor , resulting in significantly decreased signal ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) demonstrating in vivo selectivity .	
23108141_s0	Dose-dense ( DD ) regimens of combination chemotherapy may produce superior clinical outcomes , but the basis for these effects are not completely clear .	
23108141_s1	In this study , we assessed whether a DD combinatorial regimen of low-dose cisplatin and paclitaxel produces superior immune-mediated efficacy when compared with a maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) regimen in treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer as modeled in mice .	
23108141_s2	Immune responses generated by the DD regimen were identified with regard to the immune cell subset responsible for the antitumor effects observed .	avoiding immune destruction
23108141_s3	The DD regimen was less toxic to the immune system , reduced immunosuppression by the tumor microenvironment , and triggered recruitment of macrophages and tumor-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to tumors [ as determined by interleukin ( IL)-2 and IFN-Î³ secretion ] .	avoiding immune destruction
23108141_s4	In this model , we found that the DD regimen exerted greater therapeutic effects than the MTD regimen , justifying its further clinical investigation .	
23108141_s5	Fourteen patients with platinum-resistant relapse of ovarian cancer received DD chemotherapy consisting of weekly carboplatin ( AUC2 ) and paclitaxel ( 60-80 mg/m(2) ) as the third- or fourth-line treatment .	
23108141_s6	Serum was collected over the course of treatment , and serial IFN-Î³ and IL-2 levels were used to determine CD8(+) T-cell activation .	
23108141_s7	Of the four patients with disease control , three had serum levels of IL-2 and IFN-Î³ associated with cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell activity .	
23108141_s8	The therapeutic effect of the DD chemotherapy relied on the preservation of the immune system and the treatment-mediated promotion of tumor-specific immunity , especially the antitumor CD8(+) T-cell response .	avoiding immune destruction
23108141_s9	Because the DD regimen controlled drug-resistant disease through a novel immune mechanism , it may offer a fine strategy for salvage treatment .	avoiding immune destruction

23132676_s0	BACKGROUND Dickkopf-related protein 1 ( DKK1 ) has been reported involved in metastasis and invasion in several tumors .	
23132676_s1	This study sought to investigate the prognostic value of DKK1 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) and its role in promoting ICC metastasis .	
23132676_s2	METHODS Tissue microarrays of 138 ICC patient samples were employed to detect DKK1 , vascular endothelial growth factor C ( VEGF-C ) , and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP9 ) expression using immunohistochemistry .	
23132676_s3	The prognostic significances were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates .	
23132676_s4	DKK1 expression was measured in an ICC cell line ( HCCC-9810 ) and ICC tissues by immunofluorescence assay , quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , and western blot .	
23132676_s5	Serum levels of DKK1 from 37 ICC patients were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .	
23132676_s6	The role of DKK1 in proliferation , migration , invasion , and gene expression regulation was assessed by DKK1 depletion using small interfering RNA .	
23132676_s7	RESULTS Multivariate analyses revealed that DKK1 was an unfavorable predictor for overall survival and time to recurrence .	
23132676_s8	The prognostic significance was retained in ICC patients with low recurrence risk ( P &lt ; .05 ) .	
23132676_s9	DKK1 expression was elevated in an ICC cell line , tumor samples , and patient sera .	activating invasion and metastasis
23132676_s10	High levels of DKK1 in ICC tissues correlated with elevated MMP9 , VEGF-C , and metastasis of hepatic hilar lymph nodes .	activating invasion and metastasis
23132676_s11	DKK1 depletion caused a decrease in cell migration and invasiveness , and down-regulation of MMP9 and VEGF-C expression .	activating invasion and metastasis
23132676_s12	CONCLUSIONS DKK1 is a novel prognostic biomarker for ICC , and it enhances tumor cell invasion and promotes lymph node metastasis of ICC through the induction of MMP9 and VEGF-C .	activating invasion and metastasis
23132676_s13	DKK1 may be a potential therapeutic target for ICC .	
23143679_s0	We previously found that cancer metastasis is accelerated by immunosuppression during Snail-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) .	
23143679_s1	However , the molecular mechanism still remained unclear .	
23143679_s2	Here , we demonstrate that CCL2 is a critical determinant for both tumor metastasis and immunosuppression induced by Snail(+) tumor cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
23143679_s3	CCL2 is significantly upregulated in various human tumor cells accompanied by Snail expression induced by snail transduction or TGFÎ² treatment .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23143679_s4	The Snail(+) tumor-derived CCL2 amplifies EMT events in other cells including Snail(-) tumor cells and epithelial cells within tumor microenvironment .	
23143679_s5	CCL2 secondarily induces Lipocalin 2 ( LCN2 ) in the Snail(+) tumor cells in an autocrine manner .	
23143679_s6	CCL2 and LCN2 cooperatively generate immunoregulatory dendritic cells ( DCreg ) having suppressive activity accompanied by lowered expression of costimulatory molecules such as HLA-DR but increased expression of immunosuppressive molecules such as PD-L1 in human PBMCs .	avoiding immune destruction
23143679_s7	The CCL2/LCN2-induced DCreg cells subsequently induce immunosuppressive CD4(+)FOXP3(+) Treg cells , and finally impair tumor-specific CTL induction .	avoiding immune destruction
23143679_s8	In murine established tumor model , however , CCL2 blockade utilizing the specific siRNA or neutralizing mAb significantly inhibits Snail(+) tumor growth and metastasis following systemic induction of anti-tumor immune responses in host .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
23143679_s9	These results suggest that CCL2 is more than a chemoattractant factor that is the significant effector molecule responsible for immune evasion of Snail(+) tumor cells .	
23143679_s10	CCL2 would be an attractive target for treatment to eliminate cancer cells via amelioration of tumor metastasis and immunosuppression .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
23144496_s0	Adoptive T cell therapy uses the specificity of the adaptive immune system to target cancer and virally infected cells .	
23144496_s1	Yet the mechanism and means by which to enhance T cell function are incompletely described , especially in the skin .	
23144496_s2	In this study , we use a murine model of immunotherapy to optimize cell-mediated immunity in the skin .	
23144496_s3	We show that in vitro-derived central but not effector memory-like T cells bring about rapid regression of skin-expressing cognate Ag as a transgene in keratinocytes .	
23144496_s4	Local inflammation induced by the TLR7 receptor agonist imiquimod subtly yet reproducibly decreases time to skin graft rejection elicited by central but not effector memory T cells in an immunodeficient mouse model .	tumor promoting inflammation
23144496_s5	Local CCL4 , a chemokine liberated by TLR7 agonism , similarly enhances central memory T cell function .	
23144496_s6	In this model , IL-2 facilitates the development in vivo of effector function from central memory but not effector memory T cells .	
23144496_s7	In a model of T cell tolerogenesis , we further show that adoptively transferred central but not effector memory T cells can give rise to successful cutaneous immunity , which is dependent on a local inflammatory cue in the target tissue at the time of adoptive T cell transfer .	tumor promoting inflammation
23144496_s8	Thus , adoptive T cell therapy efficacy can be enhanced if CD8(+) T cells with a central memory T cell phenotype are transferred , and IL-2 is present with contemporaneous local inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
23157741_s0	OBJECTIVE To study the mechanism of interleukin 7/interleukin 7 receptor ( IL-7/IL-7R ) in promoting cell proliferation and inducing lymphangiogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in vivo and in vitro .	
23157741_s1	METHODS Immunohistochemical study for IL-7 , IL-7R , cyclin D1 and vascular endothelial growth factor-D ( VEGF-D ) was carried out in NSCLC tissues from 95 patients .	
23157741_s2	The relationship between IL-7/IL-7R expression and various parameters was analyzed .	
23157741_s3	The mechanism of IL-7/IL-7R in promoting cell proliferation and inducing lymphangiogenesis was studied by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide , fluorescence-activated cell sorting , reverse transcriptase-PCR , Western blot , co-immunoprecipitation , chromatin immunoprecipitation and nude mice experiments with xenograft tumors .	
23157741_s4	RESULTS IL-7 ( 63.2% , 60/95 ) , IL-7R ( 61.1% , 58/95 ) , cyclin D1 ( 52.6% , 50/95 ) and VEGF-D ( 58.9% , 56/95 ) showed that high level of expression in NSCLC .	
23157741_s5	IL-7/IL-7R over-expression correlated with cyclin D1 expression ( P &lt ; 0.01 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) , VEGF-D expression ( P &lt ; 0.01 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) , increased lymphovascular density ( P = 0.005 , P = 0.013 ) , advanced clinical stage ( P = 0.008 , P = 0.005 ) and presence of lymph node metastasis ( P &lt ; 0.01 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23157741_s6	IL-7/IL-7R could promote proliferation of A549 cell , increase cyclin D1 and VEGF-D expression , and enhance c-Fos/c-Jun expression and phosphorylation , resulting in formation of heterodimer .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23157741_s7	Furthermore , IL-7/IL-7R could induce binding of c-Fos/c-Jun to cyclin D1/VEGF-D promoters and regulate their transcription .	
23157741_s8	IL-7/IL-7R could also promote proliferation and lymphangiogenesis of lung cancer xenograft tumors .	
23157741_s9	CONCLUSIONS IL-7/IL-7R promotes c-Fos/c-Jun expression and activity in NSCLC .	
23157741_s10	This further facilitates cyclin D1 expression and accelerates proliferation of cells and VEGF-D-induced lymphovascular formation .	inducing angiogenesis,sustaining proliferative signaling
23157744_s0	OBJECTIVE To investigate the mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in tumor tissue and pleural effusion in advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients , and to analyze the relationship between EGFR mutations and the clinicopathologic characteristics .	
23157744_s1	METHODS Two-hundred and forty-one cases of formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissues and 14 paired pleural effusions from advanced NSCLC patients were collected .	
23157744_s2	Twenty-nine different EGFR mutations in exons 18-21 were assessed by scorpions and amplification refractory mutation system ( scorpions ARMS ) using real time PCR .	
23157744_s3	The relationship between the EGFR mutations and clinical parameters was analyzed using statistical methods .	
23157744_s4	EGFR mutation of 37 cases were detected with direct sequencing , and assessed the sensitivity , the specificity and the accuracy of scorpions ARMS .	
23157744_s5	RESULTS EGFR somatic mutations were detected in 114 of 234 advanced NSCLC patients , with the mutation rate of 48.7% , including deletions in exon 19 in 65 patients and point mutation of L858R in exon 21 in 39 patients ; both accounting for 91.2% ( 104/114 ) of all types of EGFR mutations .	genomic instability and mutation
23157744_s6	The test results of 14 paired pleural effusion specimens were entirely the same to the tissues .	
23157744_s7	The concordance rate of 2 different detection methods was 94.6% .	
23157744_s8	Mutation rate was higher in women ( 55.9% ) than in men ( 42.2% ) , and there was no difference in mutation rates between smokers and non-smokers ; patients in stage IIIB and stage IV ; adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma .	genomic instability and mutation
23157744_s9	CONCLUSIONS EGFR somatic mutations appear to occur frequently in Chinese .	genomic instability and mutation

23159001_s0	OBJECTIVE To explore the efficacy and side effects of icotinib hydrochloride in the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .	
23159001_s1	METHODS The efficacy and side effects of icotinib hydrochloride in treatment of 59 cases with stage IV NSCIC and followed-up from March 2009 to January 2012 were retrospectively analyzed .	
23159001_s2	RESULTS Twenty seven patients ( 45.8% ) showed partial response ( PR ) , 17 patients ( 28.8% ) achieved SD , and 15 ( 25.4% ) had progressive disease .

23161498_s0	An epidemiological survey was conducted in the Seine estuary and in two smaller and relatively preserved estuaries on the French Atlantic coast in order to estimate the occurrence of liver lesions in European flounder , Platichthys flesus , and also to seek putative risk factors for the recorded pathologies .	
23161498_s1	Four hundred and seventy-eight fish of both sexes and of different size ranges were sampled in the three studied areas , 338 of which in the Seine estuary .	
23161498_s2	All fish were examined for histopathological liver lesions , while DNA adducts and otoliths were analyzed on a subsample .	
23161498_s3	Five categories of hepatic lesions were recorded with the following prevalence for the Seine estuary : 36.7 % inflammations , 8 % parasites ( mainly encysted nematodes ) , 6.5 % foci of cellular alteration ( FCA ) , 5.3 % foci of necrosis or regeneration ( FNR ) , and 1.5 % tumors .	
23161498_s4	Inflammation occurrence increased according to age , contrary to parasitic infestations and FCA which were more prevalent in young fish , notably those of &lt;1 year old ( group 0 ) .	tumor promoting inflammation
23161498_s5	Tumors were only observed in females of more than two winters .	
23161498_s6	Females exhibited a higher prevalence of tumors ( 3.0 % ) and FCA ( 6.5 % ) than males ( 0 and 2.6 % , respectively ) .	
23161498_s7	Parasitic and infectious lesions and FNR were equally distributed in males and females .	
23161498_s8	The prevalence of FNR was also shown to vary according to sampling season , with significantly more occurrences of liver necrosis in the fish collected in summer than in spring .	
23161498_s9	Spatial differences were observed with a higher occurrence of encysted parasites in flounders from the upper Seine estuary , while inflammations predominated in flounders living downstream .	
23161498_s10	Temporal trends were also noted , with an increased prevalence of parasitic infestations , inflammations , and FCA in the 2002-2003 period in comparison to the 1996-1997 one .	
23161498_s11	The three flounder populations from the Seine estuary ( Normandy ) , Ster estuary ( Brittany ) , and Bay of Veys ( Normandy ) showed different spectra of hepatic lesions .	
23161498_s12	Flounders from the Bay of Veys had relatively few liver lesions as compared to flounders from the two other estuaries .	
23161498_s13	Flounders from the Ster estuary exhibited the highest prevalence of parasites ( 37.2 % ) and inflammations ( 51.1 % ) .	
23161498_s14	Finally , FCA and liver tumors occurred at very similar levels in both flounder populations from the Seine and the Ster estuaries .	
23161498_s15	Group 0 flounders inhabiting the upper Seine estuary were more prone to parasitic and pre-neoplastic hepatic lesions and had higher levels of liver DNA adducts than the older ones living downstream .	genomic instability and mutation
23161498_s16	It was postulated that group 0 European flounders may serve as valuable bioindicators for assessing the quality of estuarine waters and the health status of euryhaline fish populations .	
23172421_s0	The anthracycline doxorubicin is a widely used effective anti-cancer drug .	
23172421_s1	However , its application and dosage are severely limited due to its cardiotoxicity .	
23172421_s2	The exact mechanisms of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxic side effects remain poorly understood .	
23172421_s3	Even less is known about the impact of doxorubicin treatment on vascular damage .	
23172421_s4	We found that low doses of doxorubicin induced a senescent response in human primary vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMC ) .	enabling replicative immortality
23172421_s5	We observed that expression of urokinase receptor ( uPAR ) was upregulated in response to doxorubicin .	
23172421_s6	Furthermore , the level of uPAR expression played a decisive role in developing doxorubicin-induced senescence. uPAR silencing in human VSMC by means of RNA interference as well as uPAR knockout in mouse VSMC resulted in abrogation of doxorubicin-induced cellular senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
23172421_s7	On the contrary , uPAR overexpression promoted VSMC senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
23172421_s8	We further found that proteasomal degradation of telomeric repeat binding factor 2 ( TRF2 ) mediates doxorubicin-induced VSMC senescence .	enabling replicative immortality
23172421_s9	Our results demonstrate that uPAR controls the ubiquitin-proteasome system in VSMC and regulates doxorubicin-induced TRF2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation via this mechanism .	
23172421_s10	Therefore , VSMC senescence induced by low doses of doxorubicin may contribute to vascular damage upon doxorubicin treatment. uPAR-mediated TRF2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are further identified as a molecular mechanism underlying this process .	
23177934_s0	Metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells provides energy and multiple intermediates critical for cell growth .	
23177934_s1	Hypoxia in tumors represents a hostile environment that can encourage these transformations .	
23177934_s2	We report that glycogen metabolism is upregulated in tumors invivo and in cancer cells invitro in response to hypoxia .	
23177934_s3	Invitro , hypoxia induced an early accumulation of glycogen , followed bya gradual decline .	
23177934_s4	Concordantly , glycogen synthase ( GYS1 ) showed a rapid induction , followed by a later increase of glycogen phosphorylase ( PYGL ) .	
23177934_s5	PYGL depletion and the consequent glycogen accumulation led to increased reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) levels that contributed to a p53-dependent induction of senescence and markedly impaired tumorigenesis invivo .	enabling replicative immortality,tumor promoting inflammation
23177934_s6	Metabolic analyses indicated that glycogen degradation by PYGL is important for the optimal function of the pentose phosphate pathway .	
23177934_s7	Thus , glycogen metabolism is a key pathway induced by hypoxia , necessary for optimal glucose utilization , which represents a targetable mechanism of metabolic adaptation .	
23178952_s0	PURPOSE : Previous studies have shown that the novel microtubule poison , JG-03-14 , which binds to the colchicine binding site of tubulin , has the capacity to kill breast tumor cells primarily through the promotion of autophagy .	
23178952_s1	The current work was designed to determine whether autophagy was , in fact , the primary mode of action as well as susceptibility to JG-03-14 in two additional tumor cell models , the B16/F10 murine melanoma cell line and the HCT-116 human colon cancer cell line .	
23178952_s2	METHODS : Drug cytotoxicity was monitored based on viable cell number and clonogenic survival .	
23178952_s3	Apoptosis was assessed by DAPI staining , the TUNEL assay and/or FACS analysis .	
23178952_s4	Autophagy was monitored based on staining with acridine orange , redistribution and punctuation of RFP-LC3 and electron microscopy as well as p62 degradation .	
23178952_s5	Senescence was evaluated based on Î²-galactosidase staining and alterations in cell morphology .	
23178952_s6	Drug effects were also evaluated in a murine model of B16/F10 cells that localizes to the lungs while peripheral neuropathy was assessed by three complementary behavioral assays .	
23178952_s7	RESULTS : Both HCT-116 colon cancer cells and B16/F10 melanoma cells were sensitive to JG-03-14 in that the drug demonstrated tumor cell killing .	
23178952_s8	However , there was minimal induction of apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23178952_s9	In contrast , there was clear evidence for autophagy and autophagic flux while the residual surviving cells appeared to be in a state of irreversible senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,resisting cell death
23178952_s10	Inhibition of drug-induced autophagy in either the melanoma cells or the colon carcinoma cells was only slightly protective as the cells instead died by apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23178952_s11	JG-03-14 reduced the size of tumor nodules in mice lungs ; furthermore , the drug did not promote peripheral neuropathy .	
23178952_s12	CONCLUSIONS : Taken together with evidence for its actions as a vascular disrupting agent , these observations support the potential utility of JG-03-14 to effectively treat malignancies that might be resistant to conventional chemotherapy through evasion of apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23180767_s0	The environmental arylamine mutagens are implicated in the etiology of various sporadic human cancers .	
23180767_s1	Arylamine-modified dG lesions were studied in two fully paired 11-mer duplexes with a -G*CN- sequence context , in which G* is a C8-substituted dG adduct derived from fluorinated analogs of 4-aminobiphenyl ( FABP ) , 2-aminofluorene ( FAF ) or 2-acetylaminofluorene ( FAAF ) , and N is either dA or dT .	
23180767_s2	The FABP and FAF lesions exist in a simple mixture of ' stacked ' ( S ) and ' B-type ' ( B ) conformers , whereas the N-acetylated FAAF also samples a ' wedge ' ( W ) conformer .	
23180767_s3	FAAF is repaired three to four times more efficiently than FABP and FAF .	
23180767_s4	A simple A- to -T polarity swap in the G*CA/G*CT transition produced a dramatic increase in syn-conformation and resulted in 2- to 3-fold lower nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) efficiencies in Escherichia coli .	genomic instability and mutation
23180767_s5	These results indicate that lesion-induced DNA bending/thermodynamic destabilization is an important DNA damage recognition factor , more so than the local S/B-conformational heterogeneity that was observed previously for FAF and FAAF in certain sequence contexts .	genomic instability and mutation
23180767_s6	This work represents a novel 3'-next flanking sequence effect as a unique NER factor for bulky arylamine lesions in E. coli .	
23211746_s0	Lesion-specific enzymes repair different forms of DNA damage , yet all lesions elicit the same checkpoint response .	
23211746_s1	The common intermediate required to mount a checkpoint response is thought to be single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) , coated by replication protein A ( RPA ) and containing a primer-template junction .	
23211746_s2	To identify factors important for initiating the checkpoint response , we screened for genes that , when overexpressed , could amplify a checkpoint signal to a weak allele of chk1 in fission yeast .	
23211746_s3	We identified Ast1 , a novel member of the XPG-related family of endo/exonucleases .	
23211746_s4	Ast1 promotes checkpoint activation caused by the absence of the other XPG-related nucleases , Exo1 and Rad2 , the homologue of Fen1 .	
23211746_s5	Each nuclease is recruited to DSBs , and promotes the formation of ssDNA for checkpoint activation and recombinational repair .	genomic instability and mutation
23211746_s6	For Rad2 and Exo1 , this is independent of their S-phase role in Okazaki fragment processing .	
23211746_s7	This XPG-related pathway is distinct from MRN-dependent responses , and each enzyme is critical for damage resistance in MRN mutants .	
23211746_s8	Thus , multiple nucleases collaborate to initiate DNA damage responses , highlighting the importance of these responses to cellular fitness .	genomic instability and mutation
23220211_s0	The flow of interstitial fluid and the associated interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP ) in solid tumors and surrounding host tissues have been identified as critical elements in cancer growth and vascularization .	
23220211_s1	Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that tumors may present elevated IFP , which can be a formidable physical barrier for delivery of cell nutrients and small molecules into the tumor .	
23220211_s2	Elevated IFP may also exacerbate gradients of biochemical signals such as angiogenic factors released by tumors into the surrounding tissues .	
23220211_s3	These studies have helped to understand both biochemical signaling and treatment prognosis .	
23220211_s4	Building upon previous work , here we develop a vascular tumor growth model by coupling a continuous growth model with a discrete angiogenesis model .	
23220211_s5	We include fluid/oxygen extravasation as well as a continuous lymphatic field , and study the micro-environmental fluid dynamics and their effect on tumor growth by accounting for blood flow , transcapillary fluid flux , interstitial fluid flow , and lymphatic drainage .	
23220211_s6	We thus elucidate further the non-trivial relationship between the key elements contributing to the effects of interstitial pressure in solid tumors .	
23220211_s7	In particular , we study the effect of IFP on oxygen extravasation and show that small blood/lymphatic vessel resistance and collapse may contribute to lower transcapillary fluid/oxygen flux , thus decreasing the rate of tumor growth .	
23220211_s8	We also investigate the effect of tumor vascular pathologies , including elevated vascular and interstitial hydraulic conductivities inside the tumor as well as diminished osmotic pressure differences , on the fluid flow across the tumor capillary bed , the lymphatic drainage , and the IFP .	
23220211_s9	Our results reveal that elevated interstitial hydraulic conductivity together with poor lymphatic function is the root cause of the development of plateau profiles of the IFP in the tumor , which have been observed in experiments , and contributes to a more uniform distribution of oxygen , solid tumor pressure and a broad-based collapse of the tumor lymphatics .	
23220211_s10	We also find that the rate that IFF is fluxed into the lymphatics and host tissue is largely controlled by an elevated vascular hydraulic conductivity in the tumor .	
23220211_s11	We discuss the implications of these results on microenvironmental transport barriers , and the tumor invasive and metastatic potential .	activating invasion and metastasis
23220211_s12	Our results suggest the possibility of developing strategies of targeting tumor cells based on the cues in the interstitial fluid .	
23222813_s0	Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 ( CTHRC1 ) is a secreted protein involved in vascular remodeling , bone formation and developmental morphogenesis .	
23222813_s1	CTHRC1 has recently been shown to be expressed in human cancers such as breast cancer and melanoma .	
23222813_s2	In this study , we show that CTHRC1 is highly expressed in human pancreatic cancer tissues and plays a role in the progression and metastasis of the disease .	activating invasion and metastasis
23222813_s3	CTHRC1 promoted primary tumor growth and metastatic spread of cancer cells to distant organs in orthotopic xenograft tumor mouse models .	activating invasion and metastasis
23222813_s4	Overexpression of CTHRC1 in cancer cells resulted in increased motility and adhesiveness , whereas these cellular activities were diminished by down-regulation of the protein .	
23222813_s5	CTHRC1 activated several key signaling molecules , including Src , focal adhesion kinase , paxillin , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) , extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Rac1 .	
23222813_s6	Treatment with chemical inhibitors of Src , MEK or Rac1 and expression of dominant-negative Rac1 attenuated CTHRC1-induced cell migration and adhesion .	
23222813_s7	Collectively , our results suggest that CTHRC1 has a role in pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis by regulating migration and adhesion activities of cancer cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23245650_s0	Tumor cells exhibit enhanced glucose consumption and lactate production even when supplied with adequate oxygen ( a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect , or aerobic glycolysis ) .	
23245650_s1	Pharmacological inhibition of aerobic glycolysis represents a potential tumor-selective approach that targets the metabolic differences between normal and malignant tissues .	
23245650_s2	Human breast tumor MDA-MB-231 cells were used to develop an assay system to discover natural product-based glycolysis inhibitors .	
23245650_s3	The assay employed was based on hypersensitivity to glycolytic inhibition in tumor cells treated with the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor rotenone .	
23245650_s4	Under such conditions , ATP supply , and hence cell viability , depends exclusively on glycolysis .	
23245650_s5	This assay system was used to evaluate 10648 plant and marine organism extracts from the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Open Repository .	
23245650_s6	Bioassay-guided isolation of an active Moronobea coccinea extract yielded the new bis-geranylacylphloroglucinol derivative moronone ( 1 ) .	
23245650_s7	Compound 1 exhibited enhanced antiproliferative/cytotoxic activity in the presence of rotenone-imposed metabolic stress on tumor cells .	
23245650_s8	Surprisingly , mechanistic studies revealed that 1 did not inhibit glycolysis , but rather functions as a protonophore that dissipates the mitochondrial proton gradient .	cellular energetics
23245650_s9	In the presence of rotenone , tumor cells may be hypersensitive to protonophores due to increased ATP utilization by the ATP synthase .	
23246483_s0	DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) representa serious threat for hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) .	
23246483_s1	How cytokines and environmental signals integrate the DNA damage response and contribute to HSC-intrinsic DNA repair processes remains unknown .	
23246483_s2	Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) and its receptor , Mpl , are critical factors supporting HSC self-renewal and expansion .	
23246483_s3	Here , we uncover an unknown function for TPO-Mpl in the regulation of DNA damage response .	genomic instability and mutation
23246483_s4	We show that DNA repair following γ-irradiation ( γ-IR ) or the action of topoisomerase-II inhibitors is defective in Mpl(-/-) and in wild-type mouse or human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells treated in the absence of TPO .	genomic instability and mutation
23246483_s5	TPO stimulates DNA repair invitro and invivo by increasing DNA-PK-dependent nonhomologous end-joining efficiency .	genomic instability and mutation
23246483_s6	This ensures HSC chromosomal integrity and limits their long-term injury in response to IR.This shows that niche factors can modulate theHSC DSB repair machinery and opens new avenues for administration of TPO agonists for minimizing radiotherapy-induced HSC injury and mutagenesis .	
23251295_s0	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects and molecular mechanisms of everolimus on Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells .	
23251295_s1	Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells were treated with everolimus ( 10 Î¼g/ml ) at selected time points ( 6 , 12 and 24 h ) .	
23251295_s2	Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT and flow cytometric analyses .	
23251295_s3	The glycolytic activity was determined by measuring the activity of the key enzyme lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) and lactate production .	
23251295_s4	The activity of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling was measured by western blotting .	
23251295_s5	The expression of genes , including hexokinase 2 ( HK2 ) and microRNA-143 ( miR-143 ) , was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) .	
23251295_s6	The administration of everolimus time-dependently inhibited proliferation and glycolysis and induced apoptosis in the Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells .	cellular energetics,resisting cell death
23251295_s7	As the time of treatment with everolimus increased , the mTOR signaling activity decreased , indicated by lower phosphorylation levels of S6 kinase ; however , the phosphorylation levels of mTOR barely changed .	
23251295_s8	Moreover , our data showed an everolimus-induced increase in miR-143 and decrease in HK2 in Panc-1 cells in a time-dependent manner .	
23251295_s9	In conclusion , the current study indicates a novel role of everolimus in its antitumor effect as an inhibitor of glycolysis in Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells .	cellular energetics
23251295_s10	Furthermore , our data highlights the significance of exploring the mechanisms of everolimus and miR-143 in malignant tumors .	
23255243_s0	BACKGROUND: : Radiotherapy is an efficient remedy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma ( Hca ) ; however , some cancer cells can still survive from the radiation and the therapeutic effect is to be improved .	
23255243_s1	Regulatory T cell ( Tregs)-induced tumor tolerance and Akt expression play important roles in the tumor survival .	
23255243_s2	This study aims to elucidate the role of radiation induces Akt expression in Tregs .	
23255243_s3	METHODS: : A rat Hca model was developed .	
23255243_s4	Hca tissue was collected from the rats with or without radiotherapy .	
23255243_s5	The frequency of Treg and apoptotic Treg in Hca tissue was assessed by flow cytometry .	
23255243_s6	A cell culture model was used to investigate the mechanism by which the tumor-infiltrating Tregs survive from irradiation .	
23255243_s7	RESULTS: : After radiotherapy , the frequency of Treg was increased in Hca , the frequency of apoptotic Tregs was decreased and the expression of Akt was increased in the remaining Tregs .	resisting cell death
23255243_s8	The results were reproduced in vitro with a cell culture model .	
23255243_s9	The addition of Akt inhibitor blocked the irradiation-induced Treg survival .	
23255243_s10	Tregs with high levels of Akt still preserve the immune suppressor function .	avoiding immune destruction
23255243_s11	CONCLUSIONS: : Akt plays an important role in the radiation-induced tumor-infiltrating Treg survival in Hca .	
23255611_s0	cAMP-signaling plays an essential role in modulating the proliferation of different cell types , including cancer cells .	
23255611_s1	Until now , the regulation of this pathway was restricted to the transmembrane class of adenylyl cyclases .	
23255611_s2	In the present study , a significant overexpression of soluble adenylyl cyclase ( sAC ) , an alternative source of cAMP , was found in human prostate carcinoma and , therefore , the contribution of this cyclase was investigated in the prostate carcinoma cell lines LNCaP and PC3 .	
23255611_s3	Suppression of sAC activity by treatment with the sAC-specific inhibitor KH7 or by sAC-specific knockdown mediated by siRNA or shRNA transfection prevented the proliferation of prostate carcinoma cells , led to lactate dehydrogenase release , and induced apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23255611_s4	Cell cycle analysis revealed a significant rise in the G2-phase population 12 hours after sAC inhibition , which was accompanied by the down-regulation of cyclin B1 and CDK1. sAC-dependent regulation of proliferation involves the EPAC/Rap-1/B-Raf signaling pathway .	
23255611_s5	In contrast , protein kinase A does not play a role .	
23255611_s6	In conclusion , the present study suggests a novel sAC-dependent signaling pathway that controls the proliferation of prostate carcinoma cells .	
23264463_s0	The Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway is constitutively activated in over 90% of human colorectal cancer .	
23264463_s1	Activated Î²-catenin stimulates cell proliferation and survival , however , its anti-apoptotic mechanisms are not fully understood .	
23264463_s2	We show here that activated Î²-catenin is required to suppress caspase-8 activation but only in colon cancer cells that are resistant to tumor necrosis factor-a ( TNF ) induced apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23264463_s3	We found that lysosomal delivery of internalized TNF occurred at a faster pace in apoptosis-resistant than in apoptosis-sensitive colon cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23264463_s4	Retardation of endosomal trafficking through V-ATPase inhibition enhanced caspase-8 activation in the apoptosis-resistant but not sensitive cells .	resisting cell death
23264463_s5	Interestingly , knockdown of Î²-catenin also prolonged TNF association with the early endosome and enhanced caspase-8 activation in the apoptosis-resistant but not sensitive colon cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23264463_s6	In a mouse model of inflammation-associated colon tumors , we found nuclear expression of Î²-catenin , resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis , and reactivation of apoptosis in vivo by cotreatment of TNF with a V-ATPase inhibitor .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23264463_s7	Together , these results suggest that activated Î²-catenin can facilitate endosomal trafficking of internalized TNF to suppress caspase-8 activation in colon cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23264896_s0	Inflammation is a major risk factor for carcinogenesis in patients affected by chronic colitis , yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression from chronic inflammation to cancer are not completely understood .	
23264896_s1	Activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4)-NFÎºB signaling axis is associated with inflammation .	
23264896_s2	Thus , we hypothesized that inhibition of TLR4-NFÎºB signaling might help in limiting inflammatory responses and inflammation-induced oncogenesis .	
23264896_s3	In this work , we studied the effects of a TLR4-interacting surfactant protein A-derived ( SPA4 ) peptide on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)-induced TLR4-NFÎºB signaling and cancer progression .	
23264896_s4	We first characterized this peptide for its ability to bind the TLR4 ligand-LPS and for physico-chemical characteristics .	
23264896_s5	Inflammation was induced by challenging the colon cancer SW480 cells with Escherichia coli LPS .	tumor promoting inflammation
23264896_s6	Cells were then treated with varying amounts of the SPA4 peptide .	
23264896_s7	Changes in the expression of TLR4 , interleukin ( IL)-1Î² and IL-6 , in intracellular NFÎºB-related signal transducers ( IKBÎ± , p65 , phosphorylated IKBÎ± , phosphorylated p65 , RelB , COX-2 ) as well as in the transcriptional activity of NFÎºB were studied by immunocytochemistry , immunoblotting and NFÎºB reporter assay , respectively .	
23264896_s8	Simultaneously , the effects on LPS-induced cell migration and invasion were determined .	
23264896_s9	We found that the SPA4 peptide does not bind to LPS .	activating invasion and metastasis
23264896_s10	Rather , its binding to TLR4 inhibits the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p65 , production of IL-1Î² and IL-6 , activity of NFÎºB , migration and invasion of SW480 cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23264896_s11	In conclusion , our results suggest that the inhibition of TLR4-NFÎºB signaling by a TLR4-binding peptide may help for the treatment of chronic inflammation and prevention of inflammation-induced cancer in patients with colitis .	tumor promoting inflammation
23266555_s0	Members of the Orai family are highly selective calcium ion channels that play an important role in store-operated calcium entry .	
23266555_s1	Among the three known Orai isoforms , Orai3 has gained increased attention , notably for its emerging role in cancer .	
23266555_s2	We recently demonstrated that Orai3 channels are over-expressed in breast cancer ( BC ) biopsies , and involved specifically in proliferation , cell cycle progression and survival of MCF-7 BC cells .	
23266555_s3	Here , we investigate the downstream signaling mechanisms affected by Orai3 silencing , leading to the subsequent functional impact specifically seen in MCF-7 cancer cells .	
23266555_s4	We report a correlation between Orai3 and c-myc expression in tumor tissues and in the MCF-7 cancer cell line by demonstrating that Orai3 down-regulation reduces both expression and activity of the proto-oncogene c-myc .	
23266555_s5	This is likely mediated through the MAP Kinase pathway , as we observed decreased pERK1/2 levels and cell-cycle arrest in G1 phase after Orai3 silencing .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23266555_s6	Our results provide strong evidence that the c-myc proto-oncogene is influenced by the store-operated calcium entry channel Orai3 through the MAP kinase pathway .	
23266555_s7	This connection provides new clues in the downstream mechanism linking Orai3 channels and proliferation , cell cycle progression and survival of MCF-7 BC cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23267883_s0	We evaluated the clinical significance of indoleamine 2 , 3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) expression in breast cancer patients with bone metastasis .	
23267883_s1	IDO activity can be measured by the tryptophan(Trp)/kynurenine(Kyn) ratio .	
23267883_s2	Trp and Kyn levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) .	
23267883_s3	The serum IDO levels of postoperative breast cancer patients with a high number of bone metastases were lower than those of patients with a single metastasis lesion .	activating invasion and metastasis
23267883_s4	In addition , IDO activity increased in the cases in which the number of metastatic lesions to the bone increased .	activating invasion and metastasis
23267883_s5	These results suggest that the expression of IDO in breast cancer patients with bone metastasis may play a critical role in immunosuppression in these patients .	activating invasion and metastasis,avoiding immune destruction
23272057_s0	Hypoxia is known to play critical roles in cell survival , angiogenesis , tumor invasion , and metastasis .	
23272057_s1	Hypoxia mediated over-expression of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) has been shown to be associated with therapeutic resistance , and contributes to poor prognosis of cancer patients .	
23272057_s2	Emerging evidence suggest that hypoxia and HIF pathways contributes to the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , maintenance of cancer stem cell ( CSC ) functions , and also maintains the vicious cycle of inflammation-all which lead to therapeutic resistance .	
23272057_s3	However , the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which hypoxia/HIF drives these events are not fully understood .	
23272057_s4	Here , we show , for the first time , that hypoxia leads to increased expression of VEGF , IL-6 , and CSC signature genes Nanog , Oct4 and EZH2 consistent with increased cell migration/invasion and angiogenesis , and the formation of pancreatospheres , concomitant with increased expression of miR-21 and miR-210 in human pancreatic cancer ( PC ) cells .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
23272057_s5	The treatment of PC cells with CDF , a novel synthetic compound inhibited the production of VEGF and IL-6 , and down-regulated the expression of Nanog , Oct4 , EZH2 mRNAs , as well as miR-21 and miR-210 under hypoxia .	
23272057_s6	CDF also led to decreased cell migration/invasion , angiogenesis , and formation of pancreatospheres under hypoxia .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
23272057_s7	Moreover , CDF decreased gene expression of miR-21 , miR-210 , IL-6 , HIF-1Î± , VEGF , and CSC signatures in vivo in a mouse orthotopic model of human PC .	
23272057_s8	Collectively , these results suggest that the anti-tumor activity of CDF is in part mediated through deregulation of tumor hypoxic pathways , and thus CDF could become a novel , and effective anti-tumor agent for PC therapy .	
23273920_s0	Loss of p53 is considered to allow progression of colorectal tumors from the adenoma to the carcinoma stage .	
23273920_s1	Using mice with an intestinal epithelial cell ( IEC)-specific p53 deletion , we demonstrate that loss ofp53 alone is insufficient to initiate intestinal tumorigenesis but markedly enhances carcinogen-induced tumor incidence and leads to invasive cancer and lymph node metastasis .	
23273920_s2	Whereas p53 controls DNA damage and IEC survival during the initiation stage , loss of p53 during tumor progression is associated with increased intestinal permeability , causing formation of an NF-ÎºB-dependent inflammatory microenvironment and the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition .	activating invasion and metastasis,tumor promoting inflammation
23273920_s3	Thus , we propose a p53-controlled tumor-suppressive function that is independent of its well-established role in cell-cycle regulation , apoptosis , and senescence .	enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death
23277562_s0	SMG1 is a member of the phosphoinositide kinase-like kinase family of proteins that includes ATM , ATR , and DNA-PK , proteins with known roles in DNA damage and cellular stress responses .	
23277562_s1	SMG1 has a well-characterized role in nonsense-mediated decay as well as suggested roles in the DNA damage response , resistance to oxidative stress , regulation of hypoxic responses , and apoptosis .	
23277562_s2	To understand the roles of SMG1 further , we generated a Genetrap Smg1 mouse model .	
23277562_s3	Smg1 homozygous KO mice were early embryonic lethal , but Smg1 heterozygous mice showed a predisposition to a range of cancers , particularly lung and hematopoietic malignancies , as well as development of chronic inflammation .	tumor promoting inflammation
23277562_s4	These mice did not display deficiencies in known roles of SMG1 , including nonsense-mediated decay .	
23277562_s5	However , they showed elevated basal tissue and serum cytokine levels , indicating low-level inflammation before the development of tumors .	tumor promoting inflammation
23277562_s6	Smg1 heterozygous mice also showed evidence of oxidative damage in tissues .	genomic instability and mutation
23277562_s7	These data suggest that the inflammation observed in Smg1 haploinsufficiency contributes to susceptibility to cancer and that Smg1-deficient animals represent a model of inflammation-enhanced cancer development .	tumor promoting inflammation
23281044_s0	Aurora kinases play an essential role in mitotic progression and are potentially druggable targets in cancer therapy .	
23281044_s1	We identified benzo[e]pyridoindoles ( BePI ) as powerful aurora kinase inhibitors .	
23281044_s2	Their efficiency was demonstrated both in enzymatic inhibition studies and in cell culture assays .	
23281044_s3	New BePI molecules were synthesized , and a structure-activity relationship study was conducted with the aim of improving the activity and solubility of the lead compound .	
23281044_s4	Tetracyclic BePI derivatives are characterized by a particular curved shape , and the presence of an oxo group on the pyridine ring was found to be required for aurora kinaseâB inhibition .	
23281044_s5	New hydrosoluble benzo[e]pyridoindolones were subsequently designed , and their efficacy was tested by a combination of cell-cycle analysis and time-lapse experiments in live cells .	
23281044_s6	The most active BePI derivative , 13âb , inhibited the cell cycle , drove cells to polyploidy , and eventually induced apoptosis .	evading growth suppressors,resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23281044_s7	It exhibited high antiproliferative activity in HeLa cells with an IC(50) value of 63ânM .	
23281044_s8	Relative to compounds tested in clinical trials , this antiproliferative potency places 13âb among the top 10 aurora kinase inhibitors .	
23281044_s9	Our results justify further inâvivo evaluation in preclinical animal models of cancer .	
23287532_s0	Recent studies have highlighted an apparently paradoxical link between self-renewal and senescence triggered by DNA damage in certain cell types .	
23287532_s1	In addition , the finding that TP53 can suppress senescence has caused a re-evaluation of its functional role in regulating these outcomes .	
23287532_s2	To investigate these phenomena and their relationship to pluripotency and senescence , we examined the response of the TP53-competent embryonal carcinoma ( EC ) cell line PA1 to etoposide-induced DNA damage .	
23287532_s3	Nuclear POU5F1/OCT4A and p21cip1 were upregulated in the same cells following etoposide-induced G 2M arrest .	evading growth suppressors
23287532_s4	However , while accumulating in the karyosol , the amount of OCT4A was reduced in the chromatin fraction .	
23287532_s5	Phosphorylated CHK2 and Rad51/Î³H2AX-positive nuclear foci , overexpression of Aurora B kinase and moderate macroautophagy were evident .	
23287532_s6	Upon release from G 2M arrest , cells with repaired DNA entered mitoses , while the cells with persisting DNA damage remained at this checkpoint or underwent mitotic slippage and gradually senesced .	enabling replicative immortality,evading growth suppressors,genomic instability and mutation
23287532_s7	Reduction of TP53 using sh- or si-RNA prevented the upregulation of OCT4A and p21cip1 and increased DNA damage .	genomic instability and mutation
23287532_s8	Subsequently , mitoses , micronucleation and senescence were all enhanced after TP53 reduction with senescence confirmed by upregulation of CDKN2A/p16ink4a and increased sa-Î²-galactosidase positivity .	enabling replicative immortality
23287532_s9	Those mitoses enhanced by TP53 silencing were shown to be multicentrosomal and multi-polar , containing fragmented and highly deranged chromosomes , indicating a loss of genome integrity .	
23287532_s10	Together , these data suggest that TP53-dependent coupling of self-renewal and senescence pathways through the DNA damage checkpoint provides a mechanism for how embryonal stem cell-like EC cells safeguard DNA integrity , genome stability and ultimately the fidelity of self-renewal .	enabling replicative immortality,genomic instability and mutation
23300882_s0	We had demonstrated that plasminogen kringle 5 ( K5 ) , a potent angiogenic inhibitor , inhibited retinal neovascularization and hepatocellular carcinoma growth by anti-angiogenesis .	
23300882_s1	The current study investigated the effects and the underlying mechanisms of K5 on both tumor growth and spontaneous pulmonary metastasis in Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) implanted mouse model .	
23300882_s2	Similarly , K5 could decrease expression of VEGF in LLC cells and grafted tissues and suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth .	inducing angiogenesis
23300882_s3	K5 had no direct effect on proliferation and apoptosis of LLC .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23300882_s4	However , K5 could significantly inhibit SDF-1Î±-induced chemotaxis movement of LLC cells and resulted in a great reduction of surface metastatic nodules and micrometastases in the lungs of LLC tumor-bearing mice .	activating invasion and metastasis
23300882_s5	K5 also decreased expression of chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) in LLC cells and grafted tissues .	
23300882_s6	Furthermore , K5 down-regulated SDF-1Î± expression in metastatic lung tissues of LLC-bearing mice .	activating invasion and metastasis
23300882_s7	Therefore , K5 may suppress tumor pulmonary metastasis through inhibiting SDF-1Î±-CXCR4 chemotaxis movement and down-regulation of VEGF .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
23300882_s8	Moreover , the role of hypoxia inducible factor-1Î± ( HIF-1Î± ) , a crucial transcriptional factor for both VEGF and CXCR4 expression , was evaluated .	
23300882_s9	The siRNA of HIF-1Î± attenuated expression of VEGF and CXCR4 and inhibited LLC migration .	inducing angiogenesis
23300882_s10	K5 decreased HIF-1Î± protein level and impaired nuclear HIF-1Î± accumulation .	
23300882_s11	These results showed for the first time that K5 inhibits LLC growth and metastasis via the dual effects of anti-angiogenesis and suppression of tumor cell motility by targeting the pivotal molecule , HIF-1Î± .	activating invasion and metastasis,inducing angiogenesis
23350354_s0	Cellular redox changes have emerged as a pivotal and proximal event in cancer .	
23350354_s1	PKI 166 is used to determine the effects of redox sensitive inhibition of EGFR , metastasis and apoptosis in epidermoid carcinoma .	
23350354_s2	Cytotoxicity study of PKI 166 ( IC50 1.0 microM ) treated A431 cells were performed by MTT assay for 48 and 72 hrs .	
23350354_s3	Morphological analysis of PKI 166 treated A431 cells for 48 hrs. revealed the cell shrinkage , loss of filopodia and lamellipodia by phase contrast and SEM images in dose dependent manner .	
23350354_s4	It has cytotoxic effects through inhibiting cellular proliferation , leads to the induction of apoptosis , as increased fraction of sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle , chromatin condensation and DNA ladder .	resisting cell death
23350354_s5	It inhibited cyclin-D1 and cyclin-E expression and induced p53 , p21 expression in dose dependent manner .	evading growth suppressors,sustaining proliferative signaling
23350354_s6	Consequently , an imbalance of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio triggered caspase cascade and subsequent cleavage of PARP , thereby shifting the balance in favour of apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23350354_s7	PKI 166 treatment actively stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and mitochondrial membrane depolarization .	tumor promoting inflammation
23350354_s8	It inhibited some metastatic properties of A431 cells supressing colony formation by soft agar assay and inhibition of MMP 9 activity by gelatin zymography and western blot analysis .	activating invasion and metastasis
23350354_s9	PKI 166 inhibited growth factor induced phosphorylation of EGFR , Akt , MAPK , JNK and colony formation in A431 cells .	sustaining proliferative signaling
23350354_s10	Thus the inhibition of proliferation was associated with redox regulation of the caspase cascade , EGFR , Akt/PI3K , MAPK/ ERK and JNK pathway .	resisting cell death,sustaining proliferative signaling
23350354_s11	On the other hand , increased antioxidant activity leads to decreased ROS generation inhibit the anti-proliferative and apoptotic properties of PKI 166 in A431 cells .	resisting cell death,tumor promoting inflammation
23350354_s12	These observations indicated PKI 166 induced redox signalling dependent inhibition of cell proliferation , metastatic properties and induction of apoptotic potential in epidermoid carcinoma .	activating invasion and metastasis,resisting cell death
23406762_s0	BACKGROUND DNA-damaging compounds ( e.g. , alkylating agents , cytotoxic antibiotics and DNA topoisomerase poisons ) are the most widely used anticancer drugs .	
23406762_s1	The inability of tumor cells to properly repair some types of DNA damage may explain why specific DNA-damaging drugs can selectively kill tumor cells .	
23406762_s2	Phenylglyoxal is a dicarbonyl compound known to react with guanidine groups such as that of the DNA base guanine , therefore suggesting that phenylglyoxal could induce DNA damage and have anticancer activity .	
23406762_s3	METHODS Cellular DNA damage was measured by the alkaline comet assay and the γH2AX focus assay .	
23406762_s4	Formation of topoisomerase I- and topoisomerase II-DNA complexes was assessed by the TARDIS assay , an immunofluorescence technique that employs specific antibodies to DNA topo I or topo II to detect the protein covalently bound to the DNA in individual cells .	
23406762_s5	Cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity were determined by XTT , MTT and clonogenic assays .	
23406762_s6	Apoptosis was assessed by the Annexin V flow cytometry assay .	
23406762_s7	RESULTS Phenylglyoxal induced cellular DNA damage and formation of high levels of topoisomerase I- and topoisomerase II-DNA complexes in cells .	genomic instability and mutation
23406762_s8	These topoisomerase-DNA complexes were abolished by catalase pretreatment and correlated well with the induction of apoptosis .	resisting cell death
23406762_s9	Phenylglyoxal-induced cell death was partially prevented by catalase pretreatment and was higher in lung cancer cells ( A549 ) than in normal lung fibroblasts ( MRC5 ) .	resisting cell death
23406762_s10	Mammalian cell lines defective in nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) , homologous recombination ( HR ) and non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) were more sensitive to phenylglyoxal than parental cells ; this suggests that phenylglyoxal may induce bulky distortions in the shape of the DNA double helix ( which are repaired by the NER pathway ) and DNA double-strand breaks ( which are repaired by HR and NHEJ ) .	genomic instability and mutation
23406762_s11	CONCLUSION This report shows that phenylglyoxal is a new DNA-damaging agent with anticancer activity , and suggests that tumor cells with defects in NER , HR and NHEJ may be hypersensitive to the cytotoxic activity of phenylglyoxal .	genomic instability and mutation
23431290_s0	Autophagy is a catabolic process by which a cell degrades its intracellular materials to replenish itself .	
23431290_s1	Induction of autophagy under various cellular stress stimuli can lead to either cell survival or cell death via apoptotic and/or autophagic ( nonapoptotic ) pathways .	
23431290_s2	The NSAID sulindac sulfide induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells .	
23431290_s3	Here , we show that inhibition of autophagy under serum-deprived conditions resulted in significant reductions of sulindac sulfide-induced apoptosis in HT-29 colon cancer cells .	resisting cell death
23431290_s4	In contrast , inhibition of autophagy under conditions where serum is available significantly increased sulindac sulfide-induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells .	resisting cell death
23431290_s5	We previously showed that the apoptosis inhibitor , survivin , plays a role in regulating NSAID-induced apoptosis and autophagic cell death .	
23431290_s6	Here , we show that survivin protein half-life is increased in the presence of autophagy inhibitors under serum-deprived conditions , but not under conditions when serum is available .	resisting cell death
23431290_s7	Thus , the increased levels of survivin may be a factor contributing to inhibition of sulindac sulfide-induced apoptosis under serum-deprived conditions .	resisting cell death
23431290_s8	These results suggest that whether a cell lives or dies due to autophagy induction depends on the balance of factors that regulate both autophagic and apoptotic processes .	resisting cell death
23816712_s0	BACKGROUND Methyl sulfone is a small molecule that reverses cancerous phenotypes of a melanoma cell line .	
23816712_s1	Here , we sought to determine whether methyl sulfone was effective against human breast cancer tissue .	
23816712_s2	METHODS We studied normal and cancerous breast tissue obtained from 17 patients .	
23816712_s3	RESULTS Methyl sulfone introduced structural order , with cancer tissue taking on the morphology of normal in vivo breast tissue ; this structural order was sustainable over long-term culture .	
23816712_s4	Methyl sulfone promoted proper wound healing , including migration of cells into wounded areas and establishment of stable contact inhibition once wounds were covered .	evading growth suppressors
23816712_s5	Methyl sulfone decreased expression of two breast stem cell marker proteins , HCAM and OCT3/4 , which are associated with aberrantly rapid migration of metastatic cells .	activating invasion and metastasis
23816712_s6	Finally , normal and cancerous primary breast cells remained viable and healthy in methyl sulfone culture for at least 90 days .	
23816712_s7	CONCLUSION Methyl sulfone reintroduced a normal structural phenotype to human breast cancer tissues .	
23954413_s0	Key cellular decisions , such as proliferation or growth arrest , typically occur at spatially defined locations within tissues .	
23954413_s1	Loss of this spatial control is a hallmark of many diseases , including cancer .	
23954413_s2	Yet , how these patterns are established is incompletely understood .	
23954413_s3	Here , we report that physical and architectural features of a multicellular sheet inform cells about their proliferative capacity through mechanical regulation of YAP and TAZ , known mediators of Hippo signaling and organ growth .	
23954413_s4	YAP/TAZ activity is confined to cells exposed to mechanical stresses , such as stretching , location at edges/curvatures contouring an epithelial sheet , or stiffness of the surrounding extracellular matrix .	
23954413_s5	Weidentify the F-actin-capping/severing proteins Cofilin , CapZ , and Gelsolin as essential gatekeepers that limit YAP/TAZ activity in cells experiencing low mechanical stresses , including contact inhibition of proliferation .	evading growth suppressors
23954413_s6	We propose that mechanical forces are overarching regulators of YAP/TAZ in multicellular contexts , setting responsiveness to Hippo , WNT , and GPCR signaling .

This tutorial trains a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" class="external">Transformer model</a> to translate Portuguese to English. This is an advanced example that assumes knowledge of [text generation](text_generation.ipynb) and [attention](nmt_with_attention.ipynb).

The core idea behind the Transformer model is *self-attention*—the ability to attend to different positions of the input sequence to compute a representation of that sequence. Transformer creates stacks of self-attention layers and is explained below in the sections *Scaled dot product attention* and *Multi-head attention*.

A transformer model handles variable-sized input using stacks of self-attention layers instead of [RNNs](text_classification_rnn.ipynb) or [CNNs](../images/intro_to_cnns.ipynb). This general architecture has a number of advantages:

* It make no assumptions about the temporal/spatial relationships across the data. This is ideal for processing a set of objects (for example, [StarCraft units](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/#block-8)).
* Layer outputs can be calculated in parallel, instead of a series like an RNN.
* Distant items can affect each other's output without passing through many RNN-steps, or convolution layers (see [Scene Memory Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03878.pdf) for example).
* It can learn long-range dependencies. This is a challenge in many sequence tasks.

The downsides of this architecture are:

* For a time-series, the output for a time-step is calculated from the *entire history* instead of only the inputs and current hidden-state. This _may_ be less efficient.   
* If the input *does* have a  temporal/spatial relationship, like text, some positional encoding must be added or the model will effectively see a bag of words. 

After training the model in this notebook, you will be able to input a Portuguese sentence and return the English translation.

Since this model doesn't contain any recurrence or convolution, positional encoding is added to give the model some information about the relative position of the words in the sentence. 

The positional encoding vector is added to the embedding vector. Embeddings represent a token in a d-dimensional space where tokens with similar meaning will be closer to each other. But the embeddings do not encode the relative position of words in a sentence. So after adding the positional encoding, words will be closer to each other based on the *similarity of their meaning and their position in the sentence*, in the d-dimensional space.

See the notebook on [positional encoding](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/community/en/position_encoding.ipynb) to learn more about it. The formula for calculating the positional encoding is as follows:

"""## Scaled dot product attention

<img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/scaled_attention.png" width="500" alt="scaled_dot_product_attention">

The attention function used by the transformer takes three inputs: Q (query), K (key), V (value). The equation used to calculate the attention weights is:

$$\Large{Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax_k(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}) V} $$

The dot-product attention is scaled by a factor of square root of the depth. This is done because for large values of depth, the dot product grows large in magnitude pushing the softmax function where it has small gradients resulting in a very hard softmax. 

For example, consider that `Q` and `K` have a mean of 0 and variance of 1. Their matrix multiplication will have a mean of 0 and variance of `dk`. Hence, *square root of `dk`* is used for scaling (and not any other number) because the matmul of `Q` and `K` should have a mean of 0 and variance of 1, and you get a gentler softmax.

The mask is multiplied with -1e9 (close to negative infinity). This is done because the mask is summed with the scaled matrix multiplication of Q and K and is applied immediately before a softmax. The goal is to zero out these cells, and large negative inputs to softmax are near zero in the output.

Working with complete sequence, the query and key can include the sequence length dimension
Earlier we had worked with single  single query of dimension [m, units]
and Values = keys = encoder_outputs = [ m, Tx, units]
because query = s_prev was not available at all times in case of Bahdanau & Luong Attention.

Multi-head attention consists of four parts:

*    Scaled dot-product attention.
*    Concatenation of heads.
*    Final linear layer.

Each multi-head attention block gets three inputs; Q (query), K (key), V (value). These are put through linear (Dense) layers and split up into multiple heads. 

The `scaled_dot_product_attention` defined above is applied to each head (broadcasted for efficiency). An appropriate mask must be used in the attention step.  The attention output for each head is then concatenated (using `tf.transpose`, and `tf.reshape`) and put through a final `Dense` layer.

Instead of one single attention head, Q, K, and V are split into multiple heads because it allows the model to jointly attend to information at different positions from different representational spaces. After the split each head has a reduced dimensionality, so the total computation cost is the same as a single head attention with full dimensionality.

The transformer is an auto-regressive model: it makes predictions one part at a time, and uses its output so far to decide what to do next. 

During training this example uses teacher-forcing (like in the [text generation tutorial](./text_generation.ipynb)). Teacher forcing is passing the true output to the next time step regardless of what the model predicts at the current time step.

As the transformer predicts each word, *self-attention* allows it to look at the previous words in the input sequence to better predict the next word.

To prevent the model from peaking at the expected output the model uses a look-ahead mask.

The following steps are used for evaluation:

* Calculate the padding masks and the look ahead masks.
* The `decoder` then outputs the predictions by looking at the `encoder output` and its own output (self-attention).
* Select the last word and calculate the argmax of that.
* Concatentate the predicted word to the decoder input as pass it to the decoder.
* In this approach, the decoder predicts the next word based on the previous words it predicted.

In this tutorial, you learned about positional encoding, multi-head attention, the importance of masking and how to create a transformer.

Try using a different dataset to train the transformer. You can also create the base transformer or transformer XL by changing the hyperparameters above. You can also use the layers defined here to create [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and train state of the art models. Futhermore, you can implement beam search to get better predictions.
